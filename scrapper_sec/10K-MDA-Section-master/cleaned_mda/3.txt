item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report on form k which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates overview business overview we are a diversified global provider of leading engineered technologies to the environmental energy and fluid handling and filtration industrial segments targeting specific niche focused end markets through an attractive asset light business model we provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers diverters cyclonic technology thermal oxidizers separation and filtration systems selective catalytic reduction scr and selective non catalytic reduction sncr systems scrubbers dampers and silencers exhaust systems fluid handling equipment and plant engineered services and engineered design build fabrication these products play a vital role in helping companies achieve exacting production standards meeting increasing plant needs and stringent emissions control regulations around the globe we believe that globally we serve the broadest range of markets and industries including power municipalities chemical industrial manufacturing mid stream pipeline natural gas transmission refining petrochemical metals minerals mining companies as well as hospitals and universities therefore our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer industry trends and corporate strategy we are a global corporation with worldwide operations as a global business our operations are affected by worldwide regional and industry specific economic factors as well as political factors wherever we operate or do business our geographic and industry diversity and the breadth of our product and services portfolios have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results we believe demand for our products is driven by the increasing demand for energy in both developed and emerging markets coupled with the global trend towards increasingly restrictive environmental regulations these trends should stimulate investment in new power generation facilities and related infrastructure and in upgrading existing facilities with a shift to cleaner more environmentally responsible power generation power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels such as natural gas nuclear technology and renewable resources in developed markets natural gas is increasingly becoming one of the energy sources of choice we supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas infrastructure value chain and believe the expansion of natural gas infrastructure will drive growth within our energy segment and the global market for our scr systems for natural gas fired power plants we believe there will be an increase in the level of pollution control capital expenditures driven by an elevated focus on environmental issues such as global warming and energy saving alternatives as well as a us government supported effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the use of bio fuels like ethanol and electrical energy generated by our abundant domestic supply of coal we also feel that similar opportunities will continue to develop outside the united states much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories our asia operation is positioned to benefit from the tightening of air pollution standards by chinas ministry of environmental protection we continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability globally while continuing to strengthen and expand our presence domestically our operating strategy has historically involved horizontally expanding our scope of technology products and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then vertically integrated into our growing group of turnkey system providers our continuing focus will be on global growth market coverage and expansion of our asia operations operational excellence margin expansion after market recurring revenue growth and safety leadership are also critical to our growth strategy recent developments on september we completed the acquisition of pmfg we paid approximately million in cash and issued approximately million shares of ceco common stock to pmfg stockholders as consideration for the transaction based on the closing share price of pmfg common stock on september the transaction was valued at approximately million accounting for existing cash on hand and acquired pmfg debt the net transaction value was approximately million the cash portion of the purchase price was funded with additional debt see the liquidity and capital resources discussion below for further information on the additional debt the results of this business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are reported within our energy segment the pmfg acquisition expands our end market segment reach broadens our portfolio of products and strengthens our global geographic footprint particularly in china europe and the middle east it is also a major step forward in our strategy to become a leader in customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry we expect the acquisition to generate meaningful cost reduction synergies and global sales opportunities through significant operating and manufacturing synergies as well as the opportunity to drive important recurring revenues and new highly engineered equipment through an installed equipment base of over billion it also provides us with sales opportunities in our core end markets and gives us greater critical scale operations overview we operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management finance administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes we use this model throughout our operations this has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model the companys segment presidents manage our division managers who are responsible for successfully running their operations that is sales gross margins manufacturing pricing purchasing safety employee development and customer service excellence the segment presidents work closely with our ceo on global growth strategies operational excellence and employee development the headquarters hub focuses on enabling the core back office key functions for scale and efficiency that is accounting payroll human resourcesbenefits information technology safety support audit controls and administration we have excellent organizational focus from headquarters throughout our divisional businesses with clarity and minimal duplicative work streams we are structured for growth and will do future bolt on acquisitions our three reportable segments are the environmental segment which produces various types of product recovery and air pollution control technologies the energy segment which produces customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry and the fluid handling and filtration segment which produces high quality pump filtration and fume exhaust solutions it is through combining the efforts of some or all of these groups that we are able to offer complete turnkey systems to our customers and leverage operational efficiencies our contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage which translates into higher net income our cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors including material prices and labor cost and availability changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins we break down costs of sales into five categories they are laborour direct labor both in the shop and in the field materialraw material that we buy to build our products equipmentfans motors control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems subcontractselectrical work concrete work and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products factory overheadcosts of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products in general labor provides us the most flexibility in margin followed by material and equipment and subcontracts across our various product lines the relative relationships of these factors change and cause variations in gross margin percentage material costs have also increased faster than labor costs which also reduces gross margin percentage selling and administrative expense principally includes sales payroll and related fringes advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations the majority of these expenses are fixed we expect to leverage our fixed operating structure as we continue to grow our revenue note regarding use of non gaap financial measures the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance

strictly voluntary and is open only to existing shareholders the company may periodically issue new shares of common stock under the plan when we undertake large jobs our working capital objective is to make these projects self funding we work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments progress billing contracts when possible utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers and paying sub contractors after payment from our customers which is an industry practice our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit in connection with the met pro emtrol and pmfg acquisitions we took on significant additional debt to fund these transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information we believe that cash flows from operating activities together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash after that our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations performance and cash flow our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business regulatory legislative and other factors many of which are beyond our control employee benefit obligations based on current assumptions estimated contributions of may be required in for the pension plan and for the retiree healthcare plan the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements among other things and accordingly we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments currently our pension plan is under funded as a result absent major increases in long term interest rates above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations as of december in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest expense estimated unconditional purchase obligations pension and post retirement obligations operating lease obligations contingent liabilities related to acquisitions totals primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts future expected obligations under the companys pension and post retirement plans are included in the contractual cash obligations table above up to but not more than five years the companys pension and post retirement plan policy allows it to fund an amount which could be in excess of the pension and post retirement cost expensed subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations the company projects that it will contribute to its pension and post retirement plans during the fiscal year ended december critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments estimates and complexity use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenues bad debts share based compensation income taxes earnouts goodwill and intangible asset valuation and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts which are primarily accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting percentage completion is measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared with estimated total contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts contract costs include direct material and labor costs related to contract performance this method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods the judgments and estimates involved include managements ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete among other factors at each financial reporting period in addition certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project over which we have no or limited control and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors changes in the scope of the project weather and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability changes to job performance job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made for contracts where the duration is short total contract revenue is insignificant or reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis when risk and title passes to the customer which is generally upon shipment of product provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined no provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at december and inventories the companys inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out inventory costing method as well as the last in first out method approximately of our inventory is valued on the last in first out method inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the companys forecast of future demand and market conditions significant unanticipated changes to the companys forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives buildings and improvementsgenerally five to years machinery and equipmentgenerally two to years intangible assets indefinite life intangible assets are comprised of tradenames while finite life intangible assets are comprised of patents employment agreements technology customer lists noncompetition agreements tradenames and backlog finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives of years for patents three years for employment agreements seven to years for technology five to years for customer lists five years for noncompetition agreements years for tradenames and one year for backlog long lived assets property plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities this analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates we conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and review business plans for possible impairment impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group when impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value additionally we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization if the estimate of a long lived assets remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life the company completes an annual or more often if circumstances require impairment assessment of its indefinite life intangible assets as a part of its annual assessment typically the company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount if there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value we do not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset if this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired the estimated fair value is calculated by the relief from royalty method if the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its calculated implied fair value for the annual assessment given the lower than expected results for certain reporting units we determined that a quantitative assessment of fair value for all indefinite life intangible assets using the relief from royalty method was appropriate during our annual impairment test indicated that three of our indefinite lived tradenames were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge in our financial results of million for the year ended december see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets goodwill the company completes an annual or more often if circumstances require impairment assessment of its goodwill on a reporting unit level at or below the operating segment level in performing the goodwill impairment assessment the carrying values of the companys reporting units are compared with their estimated fair values as calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method as a part of its annual assessment the company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the company does not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative two step goodwill test for that reporting unit if this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its calculated implied fair value during management changed the annual impairment testing date from december to october for the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test as described in fasb asc was performed for all reporting units except for the recently acquired pmfg reporting unit as there were no events or changes in operations since september that would indicate possible impairment under the first step the company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a weighting of the income method and the market method on a basis in prior years the company used the income method the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue projected operational profit terminal growth rates and the cost of capital projected revenue projected operational profit and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit based on the step analysis the resultant estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of december and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded for additional information on goodwill impairment testing results see note to our consolidated financial statements income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes under asc topic tax expense includes us and international income taxes plus the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested tax credits and other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment the company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of managements intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings at december the aggregate undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries amounted to million upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise the company will be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes the unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is estimated to be approximately million at december in addition from time to time management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the company in the normal course of business in making these assessments management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions including many foreign jurisdictions the accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the company records the related interest expense and penalties if any as tax expense in the tax provision pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions we sponsor a pension plan for certain employees we also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before january several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include key assumptions such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these liabilities the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future an analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized for example one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate at december a basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately million and the annual pension expense by approximately additionally a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the pension expense by approximately share based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and recognize this cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide the services based on the fair value of the award at the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes valuation method for stock options or current publicly traded market price on the grant date for restricted stock units other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives new accounting pronouncements new financial accounting pronouncements in february the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu leases asu establishes a right of use rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december including interim periods within those fiscal years a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of asu on the companys consolidated financial statements in november the fasb issued asu balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu eliminates the prior us gaap guidance in topic income taxes that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet the amendments in asu require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group as well as any related valuation allowance be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december and interim periods within those annual periods in order to simplify presentation of deferred tax balances the company adopted this standard prospectively for the year ended december years prior to the year ended december were not retrospectively adjusted in september the fasb issued asu simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustments asu requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date in addition the amendments in the asu would require an entity to disclose either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the nature and amount of measurement period adjustments recognized in the current period including separately the amounts in current period income statement line items that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december and interim periods within those annual periods the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of asu on the companys consolidated financial statements in july the fasb issued asu simplifying the measurement of inventory asu requires inventory within the scope of the asu eg first in first out fifo or average cost to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value inventory excluded from the scope of the asu ie last in first out lifo or the retail inventory method will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market the asu also amends some of the other guidance in topic inventory to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory however those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december and interim periods within those annual periods the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in april the fasb issued asu simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the fasb issued the asu to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and to align with other existing fasb guidance asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december and interim periods within those annual periods the company early adopted this asu in the year ended december as a result of the adoption all debt related costs are now presented as a direct offset to the long term debt and therefore million in deferred financing costs were reclassified from deferred charges and other assets to debt less current portion at december on the consolidated balance sheet in may the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers asu supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition principles under gaap the core principle of asu is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to for those goods or services using a defined five step process more judgment and estimates may be required to achieve this principle than under existing gaap asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december including interim periods therein using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect upon initial adoption recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on the companys consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method of adoption item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks primarily changes in interest rates market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates for the company these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates we do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes however we do have an interest rate swap in place as of december to hedge against a portion of our interest rate exposure related to debt indexed to libor market rates see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this interest rate swap the carrying value of the companys total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt at december was million market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the companys estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december most of the interest on the companys debt is indexed to either the libor or euribor market rates the estimated impact of a hypothetical change in the estimated weighted average borrowing rate excluding the portion of debt which has an interest rate fixed by the interest rate swap described above at december is million on an annual basis the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the netherlands canada the peoples republic of china mexico united kingdom singapore and chile in the past we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues operating expenses and earnings on march our subsidiary in the netherlands entered into a one month foreign exchange forward contract to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on a us dollar denominated transaction totaling million the contract expired prior to december and there are no such contracts outstanding as of december due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the year ending december
