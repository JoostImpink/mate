Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products. Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we 18 attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to our employees or other parties is misappropriated from our systems and networks. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and investors may not be able to resell shares they purchase at their purchase price. The stock market has experienced and may in the future experience volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ has ranged from a low of $6.87 to a high of $15.69 per share. We expect our common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in the common stock price may include, among other things: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; adverse general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, withdrawals of investments in the stock markets generally or a tightening of credit available to potential acquirers of businesses, that result in a lower average prices being paid for public company shares and lower valuations being placed on businesses; other domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance; our failure to meet the expectations of the investment community; industry trends and the business success of our customers; loss of key customers; announcements of technological advances by us or our competitors; current events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States; conditions or trends in our industry, including demand for our products and services, technological advances and governmental regulations; litigation or other proceedings involving or affecting us; and additions or departures of our key personnel. The realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. The number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock. We have reserved 3.3 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan), which may include option grants, stock grants and restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 2.8 million options or shares of restricted stock have been issued under the 2007 Plan. Icarus, an affiliate of ours, owns warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock that have piggy back rights granting it the right to require that we register such shares in the event we file any registration statements in the future. We had outstanding options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock under our 1997 Stock Option Plan, and outstanding options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock and outstanding restricted stock units relating to approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock under our 2007 plan as of December 31, 2015. The shares under both plans are registered for resale on currently effective registration statements. 19 We may issue additional restricted securities or register additional shares of common stock under the Securities Act in the future. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or warrants, vesting of restricted stock units, or the availability for sale, or resale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock under registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. One or more issuances of shares of our common stock under our stock incentive plan or securities in connection with financing transactions or the conversion of warrants will dilute current shareholders. Pursuant to our stock incentive plan, we may grant stock awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Dilution will occur upon exercise of any outstanding stock awards convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock. Moreover, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities, further dilution to our existing shareholders will result. In addition, we have historically issued warrants to purchase common shares in conjunction with business acquisitions, debt issuances and employment contracts, of which 250,000 warrants are currently outstanding, which may cause dilution when exercised. Our ability to issue preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms that may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors. Accordingly, we may issue shares of any series of preferred stock that would rank senior to our common stock as to voting or dividend rights or rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Certain provisions in our charter documents have anti takeover effects. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us. Such provisions, including those limiting who may call special shareholders meetings, together with the possible issuance of our preferred stock without shareholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholders best interest.

Refer to Item 7 for discussion relating to adjustments to results of operations from the Earnings Release filing on March 10, 2016 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 25 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Overview Business Overview We are a diversified global provider of leading engineered technologies to the environmental, energy, and fluid handling and filtration industrial segments, targeting specific niche focused end markets through an attractive asset light business model. We provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers & diverters, cyclonic technology, thermal oxidizers, separation and filtration systems, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) systems, scrubbers, dampers and silencers, exhaust systems, fluid handling equipment and plant engineered services and engineered design build fabrication. These products play a vital role in helping companies achieve exacting production standards, meeting increasing plant needs and stringent emissions control regulations around the globe. We believe that globally we serve the broadest range of markets and industries including power, municipalities, chemical, industrial manufacturing, mid stream pipeline natural gas transmission, refining, petrochemical, metals, minerals & mining companies, as well as hospitals and universities. Therefore, our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolios, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. We believe demand for our products is driven by the increasing demand for energy in both developed and emerging markets, coupled with the global trend towards increasingly restrictive environmental regulations. These trends should stimulate investment in new power generation facilities and related infrastructure, and in upgrading existing facilities. With a shift to cleaner, more environmentally responsible power generation, power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear technology and renewable resources. In developed markets, natural gas is increasingly becoming one of the energy sources of choice. We supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas infrastructure value chain and believe the expansion of natural gas infrastructure will drive growth within our Energy segment and the global market for our SCR systems for natural gas fired power plants. We believe there will be an increase in the level of pollution control capital expenditures driven by an elevated focus on environmental issues such as global warming and energy saving alternatives, as well as a U.S. Government supported effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the use of bio fuels like ethanol and electrical energy generated by our abundant domestic supply of coal. We also feel that similar opportunities will continue to develop outside the United States. Much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories. Our Asia operation is positioned to benefit from the tightening of air pollution standards by Chinas Ministry of Environmental Protection. We continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability globally while continuing to strengthen and expand our presence domestically. Our operating strategy has historically involved horizontally expanding our scope of technology, products, and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then vertically integrated into our growing group of turnkey system providers. Our continuing focus will be on global growth, market coverage, and expansion of our Asia operations. Operational excellence, margin expansion, after market recurring revenue growth, and safety leadership are also critical to our growth strategy. 26 Recent Developments On September 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of PMFG. We paid approximately $65 million in cash and issued approximately 7.6 million shares of CECO common stock to PMFG stockholders as consideration for the transaction. Based on the closing share price of PMFG common stock on September 2, 2015, the transaction was valued at approximately $137 million. Accounting for existing cash on hand and acquired PMFG debt, the net transaction value was approximately $121 million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with additional debt. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information on the additional debt. The results of this business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are reported within our Energy segment. The PMFG acquisition expands our end market segment reach, broadens our portfolio of products and strengthens our global geographic footprint, particularly in China, Europe and the Middle East. It is also a major step forward in our strategy to become a leader in customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry. We expect the acquisition to generate meaningful cost reduction synergies and global sales opportunities through significant operating and manufacturing synergies, as well as the opportunity to drive important recurring revenues and new highly engineered equipment through an installed equipment base of over $5 billion. It also provides us with sales opportunities in our core end markets and gives us greater critical scale. Operations Overview We operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management, finance, administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes. We use this model throughout our operations. This has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model. The Companys segment presidents manage our division managers who are responsible for successfully running their operations, that is, sales, gross margins, manufacturing, pricing, purchasing, safety, employee development and customer service excellence. The segment presidents work closely with our CEO on global growth strategies, operational excellence, and employee development. The headquarters (hub) focuses on enabling the core back office key functions for scale and efficiency, that is, accounting, payroll, human resources/benefits, information technology, safety support, audit controls, and administration. We have excellent organizational focus from headquarters throughout our divisional businesses with clarity and minimal duplicative work streams. We are structured for growth and will do future bolt on acquisitions. Our three reportable segments are: the Environmental segment, which produces various types of product recovery and air pollution control technologies, the Energy segment, which produces customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry, and the Fluid Handling and Filtration segment, which produces high quality pump, filtration and fume exhaust solutions. It is through combining the efforts of some or all of these groups that we are able to offer complete turnkey systems to our customers and leverage operational efficiencies. Our contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers. Contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project. Our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage, which translates into higher net income. Our cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors including material prices and labor cost and availability. Changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins. We break down costs of sales into five categories. They are: LaborOur direct labor both in the shop and in the field; MaterialRaw material that we buy to build our products; EquipmentFans, motors, control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems; SubcontractsElectrical work, concrete work and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products; Factory overheadCosts of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products. In general, labor provides us the most flexibility in margin followed by material and equipment and subcontracts. Across our various product lines, the relative relationships of these factors change and cause variations in gross margin percentage. Material costs have also increased faster than labor costs, which also reduces gross margin percentage. 27 Selling and administrative expense principally includes sales payroll and related fringes, advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations. The majority of these expenses are fixed. We expect to leverage our fixed operating structure as we continue to grow our revenue. Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this MD&A that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this supplemental non GAAP financial information, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance, and which the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non GAAP financial measures of non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, non GAAP operating income, non GAAP operating margin, and non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include charges associated with the Companys acquisition and integration of recent acquisitions, including PMFG, and the items described below in Consolidated Results. The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. As a result of the Companys recently completed acquisitions, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with the acquisition and integration. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat these charges as special items in its future presentation of non GAAP results. See Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Year ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 367.4 $ 263.2 $ 197.3 Cost of goods sold 258.2 178.4 135.7 Gross profit $ 109.2 $ 84.8 $ 61.6 Percent of sales 29.7 % 32.2 % 31.2 % Selling and administrative $ 67.5 $ 51.4 $ 37.2 Percent of sales 18.4 % 19.5 % 18.9 % Acquisition and integration expense $ 7.9 $ 1.3 $ 7.2 Percent of sales 2.2 % 0.5 % 3.6 % Amortization and earn out expenses $ 25.6 $ 10.1 $ 6.7 Percent of sales 7.0 % 3.8 % 3.4 % Intangible asset impairment $ 3.3 $ $ Percent of sales 0.9 % Legal reserves $ $ 0.3 $ 3.5 Percent of sales 0.0 % 0.1 % 1.8 % Operating income $ 4.9 $ 21.7 $ 7.0 Percent of sales 1.3 % 8.2 % 3.5 % 28 On March 10, 2016, the Company furnished a Current Report on Form 8 K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included an earnings release issued that same day reporting results for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 thereto (the Earnings Release). Between the issuance of the Earnings Release and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company became aware of additional information affecting its final closing adjustments, which resulted in the Company recording, for the three month period ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in net sales of $2.7 million, a decrease in cost of goods sold of $0.3 million, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $2.0 million, resulting in a decrease in pre tax income of $0.4 million, which was offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $0.4 million. The net impact of these adjustments had no impact on net income or diluted earnings per share as initially reported for the year ended December 31, 2015. To compare operating performance between the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income and GAAP net income to exclude (1) acquisition and integration related expenses, including legal, accounting, and banking expenses, (2) amortization and contingent acquisition expenses, including amortization of acquisition related intangibles, retention, severance, and earn out expenses, (3) legal reserves, (4) inventory valuation and plant, property and equipment valuation adjustments related to the Met Pro and PMFG acquisitions, (5) intangible asset impairment, (6) foreign currency remeasurement with respect to intercompany loans, (7) write off of deferred financing fees associated with debt extinguishment, and (8) with respect to net income, associated tax benefits of these charges. The Company has adjusted GAAP gross profit to exclude inventory valuation and plant, property and equipment valuation adjustments related to the Met Pro and PMFG acquisitions. See Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures above. The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross profit margin to non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating margin, and GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. to non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp.: Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Gross profit as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 109.2 $ 84.8 $ 61.6 Gross profit margin in accordance with GAAP 29.7 % 32.2 % 31.2 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Non GAAP gross profit $ 110.3 $ 85.4 $ 62.9 Non GAAP Gross profit margin 30.0 % 32.4 % 31.9 % Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 4.9 $ 21.7 $ 7.0 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP 1.3 % 8.2 % 3.5 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Acquisition and integration expenses 7.9 1.3 7.2 Amortization and earn out expenses 25.6 10.1 6.8 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 0.3 3.5 Non GAAP operating income $ 42.8 $ 34.0 $ 25.8 Non GAAP Operating margin 11.6 % 12.9 % 13.1 % 29 Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net (loss) income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. as reported in accordance with GAAP $ (5.6 ) $ 13.1 $ 6.6 Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Acquisition and integration expenses 7.9 1.3 7.2 Amortization and earn out expenses 25.6 10.1 6.8 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 0.3 3.5 Deferred financing fee adjustment 0.3 Foreign currency remeasurement 2.5 2.9 (1.1 ) Tax benefit of expenses (7.1 ) (3.7 ) (4.6 ) Non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. $ 28.0 $ 24.6 $ 19.7 Non GAAP Net income 7.6 % 9.3 % 10.0 % Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Consolidated sales in 2015 were $367.4 million compared with $263.2 million in 2014, an increase of $104.2 million. The increase in sales was due primarily to the acquisitions of HEE in mid August 2014, SAT at the end of September 2014, Emtrol at the beginning of November 2014, Zhongli at the end of December 2014, and PMFG at the beginning of September 2015. These acquisitions contributed an incremental $103.0 million of sales in 2015. Gross profit increased by $24.4 million, or 28.8%, to $109.2 million in 2015 compared with $84.8 million in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.7% in 2015 compared with 32.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit on a dollar basis was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions, which contributed $27.1 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in overall gross profit percentage due to product mix. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $110.3 million or 30.0% as a percentage of sales for 2015, an increase of $24.9 million on a dollar basis compared with non GAAP gross margin of $85.4 million or 32.4% as a percentage of sales in 2014. Selling and administrative expenses were $67.5 million in 2015 compared with $51.4 million in 2014. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.4% in 2015 compared with 19.5% in 2014. Acquisition and integration expenses of $7.9 million in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2014 relate to acquisition activities, which include legal, accounting, and banking expenses. Amortization and earn out expense was $25.6 million in 2015 and $10.1 million in 2014. This increase was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Of the increase in 2015, $11.2 million is an adjustment to the fair value of the earn out from the Zhongli acquisition. The fair value adjustment to the earn out was the result of Zhongli performing above initial acquisition date operational expectations. Legal reserves of $0.3 million in 2014 relate to the settlement of the Valero lawsuit. There were no such reserves in 2015. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Operating income for 2015 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $16.8 million from $21.7 million in 2014. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2015 was 1.3% compared with 8.2% for 2014. The decrease in operating income was attributable to the aforementioned acquisitions, and associated acquisition and integration expenses, as well as the amortization and earn out expenses. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP operating income was $42.8 million for 2015, an increase of $8.8 million from 2014. Non GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2015 was 11.6% compared with 12.9% for 2014, down slightly year over year. Other expense for 2015 was $2.1 million compared with $2.3 million in 2014, and was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses in 2015 and 2014. The expense in 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to a translation remeasurement on U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany debt at our subsidiary in the Netherlands. 30 Interest expense increased to $6.0 million in 2015 from $3.1 million in 2014, due to higher debt levels in 2015, which debt was incurred in connection with the PMFG and Emtrol acquisitions. Income tax expense was $2.6 million and $3.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2015 was (85.2)% compared with 19.3% in 2014. The effective tax rate was adversely impacted $3.9 million by nondeductible earnout expenses, $1.4 million by nondeductible deal costs related to the PMFG acquisition, as well as $1.2 million of certain permanent differences, which more than offset the benefits of $1.5 million from foreign rate differences and $1.3 million of changes in uncertain tax position reserves. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Consolidated sales in 2014 were $263.2 million compared with $197.3 million in 2013, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in sales was primarily due to the acquisitions of Aarding at the end of February 2013, Met Pro at the end of August 2013, HEE in mid August 2014, SAT at the end of September 2014, and Emtrol at the beginning of November 2014. These acquisitions contributed an incremental $71.6 million of sales in 2014. Gross profit increased by $23.2 million, or 37.7%, to $84.8 million in 2014 compared with $61.6 million in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.2% in 2014 compared with 31.2% in 2013. The increase gross profit was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $85.4 million or 32.4% as a percentage of sales for 2014, an increase of $22.5 million compared with non GAAP gross margin of $62.9 million or 31.9% as a percentage of sales in 2013. Selling and administrative expenses were $51.4 million in 2014 compared with $37.1 million in 2013. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Acquisition and integration expenses of $1.3 million in 2014 and $7.2 million in 2013 relate to acquisition activities, which include legal, accounting, and banking expenses. Amortization and earnout expense was $10.1 million in 2014 and $6.8 million in 2013. This increase was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Legal reserves of $0.3 million in 2014 relate to the settlement of the Valero lawsuit. Legal reserves of $3.5 million in 2013 relate to the settlement of the Sheet Workers Local Union No. 80 claim. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Operating income for 2014 was $21.7 million, an increase of $14.7 million from $7.0 million in 2013. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2014 was 8.2% compared with 3.5% for 2013. The increase in operating income was attributable to the aforementioned acquisitions. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP operating income was $34.0 million for 2014, an increase of $8.2 million from 2013. Non GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2014 was 12.9% compared with 13.1% for 2013, which is essentially flat year over year. Other (expense) income for 2014 was $(2.3) million compared with $1.0 million in 2013, and was comprised of foreign currency transaction losses in 2014 and foreign currency transaction gains in 2013. The expense in 2014 and income in 2013 is primarily attributable to a translation remeasurement on U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany debt at our subsidiary in the Netherlands. Interest expense increased to $3.1 million in 2014 from $1.5 million in 2013, due to higher debt levels in 2014, which debt was incurred in connection with the Met Pro and Emtrol acquisitions. Income tax expense (benefit) was $3.1 million in 2014 compared with $(0.1) million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 19.3% compared with (1.6)% in 2013. Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2013 is a $2.4 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2013. This credit was not factored in the 2012 tax provision because it was not evaluated until 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, the effective tax rate is beneficially impacted by the domestic production activities deduction, offset by nondeductible deal costs related to the Met Pro acquisition. 31 Business Segments The Companys operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and presented in three reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through to the Income from operations line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amounts presented in the Net Sales table below and in the following comments regarding our net sales at the reportable business segment level exclude both intra segment and inter segment net sales.

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Environmental Segment Our Environmental segment net sales increased $30.7 million to $158.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $127.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 24.0%. The increase is due to the HEE and Emtrol acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $9.0 million and $23.9 million in net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income from the Environmental segment increased $0.2 million to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $16.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 1.2%. The increase was due in part to the HEE and Emtrol acquisitions, which accounted for an incremental $0.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by declines in operating income of legacy businesses. Energy Segment Our Energy segment net sales increased $71.9 million to $142.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $70.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 102.3%. The increase is primarily due to the PMFG and Zhongli acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $40.8 million and $28.1 million in net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income from the Energy segment decreased $4.3 million to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 55.1%. The decrease was due primarily to earnout expense of $11.2 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of the earn out liability associated with the Zhongli acquisition (see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information). This decrease was partially offset by PMFG operating income of $2.0 million, and Zhongli operating income (exclusive of the earnout expense discussed above) of $5.2 million in 2015. 32 Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment Our FHF segment net sales increased $2.0 million to $67.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 3.0%. The increase in revenue from 2014 to 2015 is due to sales volume growth within the segment year over year. Operating income from the FHF segment decreased $1.5 million to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $13.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of $2.9 million related to two tradename intangible assets within the segment, partially offset by an increase due to gross margin improvements year over year. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Environmental Segment Our Environmental segment net sales increased $26.5 million to $127.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $101.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 26.3%.

Operating income from the Environmental segment increased $1.4 million to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $15.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 9.0%. The increase was due in part to the Met Pro and Emtrol acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $3.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by lower operating income from legacy operations of $2.9 million due to lower gross margins. Energy Segment Our Energy segment net sales increased $0.9 million to $70.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $69.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 1.3%. Operating income from the Energy segment decreased $1.5 million to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 16.1%. The decrease was due in part to a decline in overall margins. Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment Our FHF segment net sales increased $40.4 million to $65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 160.3%. The increase is primarily due to the Met Pro acquisition, which accounted for an incremental $39.3 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining $1.1 million increase was due to an increase in sales volumes in the legacy operations. Operating income from the FHF segment increased $11.8 million to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to the Met Pro acquisition, which accounted for and incremental $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining $0.9 million increase was due to higher gross margins in legacy operations. 33 Non GAAP Measures for the Three Months Ended December 31 The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin to non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating margin: Three Months Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net sales as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 101.2 $ 76.1 $ 68.7 Gross profit as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 30.8 $ 22.6 $ 21.5 Gross profit margin in accordance with GAAP 30.4 % 29.7 % 31.3 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 0.7 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.1 0.1 0.1 Non GAAP gross profit $ 31.4 $ 22.7 $ 22.3 Non GAAP gross profit margin 31.0 % 29.8 % 32.4 % Three Months Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ (0.3 ) $ 3.8 $ 3.7 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP (0.3 )% 5.0 % 5.4 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 0.7 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.1 0.1 0.1 Acquisition and integration expenses 0.9 0.9 0.6 Amortization and earn out expenses 5.6 2.8 3.3 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 1.0 Non GAAP operating income $ 10.1 $ 7.6 $ 9.4 Non GAAP operating margin 10.0 % 10.0 % 13.6 % On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $31.4 million or 31.0% as a percentage of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $8.7 million compared with non GAAP gross margin of $22.7 million or 29.8% as a percentage of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2014.

Backlog Our backlog consists of the amount of revenue we expect from complete performance of uncompleted, signed, firm fixed price contracts that have not been completed for products and services we expect to substantially deliver within the next 12 months. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $211.2 million compared with $140.1 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in backlog at December 31, 2015 was a result of the acquisition of PMFG, which represented $80.5 million of our backlog at December 31, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Credit Facility (defined below). Our principal uses of cash are operating costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, dividends, working capital and other corporate requirements, including acquisitions. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $34.2 million and $18.2 million, respectively.

The consolidated leverage ratio will then remain at 3.00 until the end Credit Agreement term. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and the occurrence of an event of default could result in an increased interest rate equal to 2.0% above the applicable interest rate for loans, the acceleration of the Companys obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement and an obligation of the subsidiary guarantors to repay the full amount of the Companys borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

During 2015 and 2014, our Board declared the following quarterly cash dividends on our common stock: Dividend Per Share Record Date Payment Date $0.066 December 16, 2015 December 30, 2015 $0.066 September 18, 2015 September 30, 2015 $0.066 June 12, 2015 June 26, 2015 $0.066 March 19, 2015 March 31, 2015 $0.060 December 19, 2014 December 30, 2014 $0.060 September 16, 2014 September 30, 2014 $0.060 June 13, 2014 June 27, 2014 $0.050 March 19, 2014 March 31, 2014 On March 9, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.066 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 30, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2016. Effective August 13, 2012, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), under which the Company may issue up to 750,000 shares of common stock. The Plan provides a way for interested shareholders to increase their holdings in our common stock. Participation in the Plan is strictly voluntary and is open only to existing shareholders. The Company may periodically issue new shares of common stock under the Plan. When we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit. In connection with the Met Pro, Emtrol, and PMFG acquisitions, we took on significant additional debt to fund these transactions. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Employee Benefit Obligations Based on current assumptions, estimated contributions of $29,000 may be required in 2016 for the pension plan and $27,000 for the retiree healthcare plan. The amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements, among other things and, accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments. Currently, our pension plan is under funded. As a result, absent major increases in long term interest rates, above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements, we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 38 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt $ 181,557 $ 19,494 $ 31,876 $ 130,187 $ Interest expense (estimated) 23,814 5,890 10,091 7,833 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 93,412 93,412 Pension and post retirement obligations (2) 5,360 56 2,916 2,388 Operating lease obligations 17,127 3,952 5,524 2,562 5,089 Contingent liabilities related to acquisitions 32,670 14,756 17,914 Totals $ 353,940 $ 137,560 $ 68,321 $ 142,970 $ 5,089 (1) Primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts. (2) Future expected obligations under the Companys pension and post retirement plans are included in the contractual cash obligations table above, up to, but not more than five years. The Companys pension and post retirement plan policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of the pension and post retirement cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. The Company projects that it will contribute $56,000 to its pension and post retirement plans during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity. Use of Estimates Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, bad debts, share based compensation, income taxes, earnouts, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts, which are primarily accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Percentage completion is measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared with estimated total contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs include direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. This method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods. The judgments and estimates involved include managements ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete, among other factors, at each financial reporting period. In addition, certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project, over which we have no or limited control, and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors, changes in the scope of the project, weather, and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. For contracts where the duration is short, total contract revenue is insignificant, or reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made, revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis, when risk and title passes to the customer, which is generally upon shipment of product. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 39 Inventories The Companys inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out inventory costing method as well as the last in, first out method. Approximately 13% of our inventory is valued on the last in, first out method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the Companys forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to the Companys forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvementsgenerally five to 40 years; machinery and equipmentgenerally two to 15 years). Intangible assets Indefinite life intangible assets are comprised of tradenames, while finite life intangible assets are comprised of patents, employment agreements, technology, customer lists, noncompetition agreements, tradenames, and backlog. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives of 17 years for patents, three years for employment agreements, seven to 10 years for technology, five to 20 years for customer lists, five years for noncompetition agreements, 10 years for tradenames, and one year for backlog. Long lived assets Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long lived assets remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its indefinite life intangible assets. As a part of its annual assessment, typically, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated by the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its calculated implied fair value. For the 2015 annual assessment, given the lower than expected results for certain reporting units, we determined that a quantitative assessment of fair value for all indefinite life intangible assets using the relief from royalty method was appropriate. During 2015, our annual impairment test indicated that three of our indefinite lived tradenames were impaired. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment charge in our financial results of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its goodwill on a reporting unit level, at or below the operating segment level. In performing the goodwill impairment assessment, the carrying values of the Companys reporting units are compared with their estimated fair values, as calculated using a weighting of the income method 40 and the market method. As a part of its annual assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the Company does not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative two step goodwill test for that reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its calculated implied fair value. During 2015, management changed the annual impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1. For 2015, the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350 20 35 was performed for all reporting units, except for the recently acquired PMFG reporting unit, as there were no events or changes in operations since September that would indicate possible impairment. Under the first step, the Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a weighting of the income method and the market method on a 50/50 basis. In prior years, the Company used the income method. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue, projected operational profit and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on the step 1 analysis, the resultant estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded. For additional information on goodwill impairment testing results, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Tax credits and other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of managements intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries amounted to $40.2 million. Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company will be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is estimated to be approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We sponsor a pension plan for certain employees. We also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before January 1, 1990. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. These factors include key assumptions, such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate 41 these liabilities. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future. An analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized. For example, one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. At December 31, 2015, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and the annual pension expense by approximately $2,000. Additionally, a 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the pension expense by approximately $61,000. Share Based Compensation We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and recognize this cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide the services, based on the fair value of the award at the date of the grant as determined by the Black Scholes valuation method for stock options, or current publicly traded market price on the grant date for restricted stock units. Other significant accounting policies Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives. New Accounting Pronouncements New Financial Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 02, Leases. ASU 2016 02 establishes a right of use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016 02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 02 on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015 17 eliminates the prior US GAAP guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. The amendments in ASU 2015 17 require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015 17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. In order to simplify presentation of deferred tax balances, the Company adopted this standard prospectively for the year ended December 31, 2015. Years prior to the year ended December 31, 2015 were not retrospectively adjusted. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments. ASU 2015 16 requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, the amendments in the ASU would require an entity to disclose (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the nature and amount of measurement period adjustments recognized in the current period, including separately the amounts in current period income statement line items that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015 16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2015 16 on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015 11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g. first in, first out (FIFO) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market. The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more 42 clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory. However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice. ASU 2015 11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015 03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The FASB issued the ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, and to align with other existing FASB guidance. ASU 2015 03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company early adopted this ASU in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the adoption, all debt related costs are now presented as a direct offset to the long term debt, and therefore $0.6 million in deferred financing costs were reclassified from Deferred Charges and Other Assets to Debt, Less Current Portion at December 31, 2014 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014 09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers. ASU 2014 09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition principles under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014 09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to for those goods or services using a defined five step process. More judgment and estimates may be required to achieve this principle than under existing GAAP. ASU 2014 09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect upon initial adoption recognized at the date of adoption, which includes additional footnote disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014 09 on the Companys consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method of adoption. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. For the Company, these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates. We do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes. However, we do have an interest rate swap in place as of December 31, 2015 to hedge against a portion of our interest rate exposure related to debt indexed to LIBOR market rates. See Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this interest rate swap. The carrying value of the Companys total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2015 was $177.3 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease (increase) in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase (decrease) in the Companys estimated weighted average borrowing rate at December 31, 2015. Most of the interest on the Companys debt is indexed to either the LIBOR or EURIBOR market rates. The estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% change in the estimated weighted average borrowing rate, excluding the portion of debt which has an interest rate fixed by the interest rate swap described above, at December 31, 2015 is $0.4 million on an annual basis. The Company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, Canada, the Peoples Republic of China, Mexico, United Kingdom, Singapore, and Chile. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings. On March 31, 2014, our subsidiary in the Netherlands entered into a one month foreign exchange forward contract to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on a U.S. dollar denominated transaction totaling $5.5 million. The contract expired prior to December 31, 2015 and there are no such contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency, we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the year ending December 31, 2016. 43

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Overview Business Overview We are a diversified global provider of leading engineered technologies to the environmental, energy, and fluid handling and filtration industrial segments, targeting specific niche focused end markets through an attractive asset light business model. We provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers & diverters, cyclonic technology, thermal oxidizers, separation and filtration systems, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) systems, scrubbers, dampers and silencers, exhaust systems, fluid handling equipment and plant engineered services and engineered design build fabrication. These products play a vital role in helping companies achieve exacting production standards, meeting increasing plant needs and stringent emissions control regulations around the globe. We believe that globally we serve the broadest range of markets and industries including power, municipalities, chemical, industrial manufacturing, mid stream pipeline natural gas transmission, refining, petrochemical, metals, minerals & mining companies, as well as hospitals and universities. Therefore, our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolios, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. We believe demand for our products is driven by the increasing demand for energy in both developed and emerging markets, coupled with the global trend towards increasingly restrictive environmental regulations. These trends should stimulate investment in new power generation facilities and related infrastructure, and in upgrading existing facilities. With a shift to cleaner, more environmentally responsible power generation, power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear technology and renewable resources. In developed markets, natural gas is increasingly becoming one of the energy sources of choice. We supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas infrastructure value chain and believe the expansion of natural gas infrastructure will drive growth within our Energy segment and the global market for our SCR systems for natural gas fired power plants. We believe there will be an increase in the level of pollution control capital expenditures driven by an elevated focus on environmental issues such as global warming and energy saving alternatives, as well as a U.S. Government supported effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the use of bio fuels like ethanol and electrical energy generated by our abundant domestic supply of coal. We also feel that similar opportunities will continue to develop outside the United States. Much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories. Our Asia operation is positioned to benefit from the tightening of air pollution standards by Chinas Ministry of Environmental Protection. We continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability globally while continuing to strengthen and expand our presence domestically. Our operating strategy has historically involved horizontally expanding our scope of technology, products, and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then vertically integrated into our growing group of turnkey system providers. Our continuing focus will be on global growth, market coverage, and expansion of our Asia operations. Operational excellence, margin expansion, after market recurring revenue growth, and safety leadership are also critical to our growth strategy. 26 Recent Developments On September 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of PMFG. We paid approximately $65 million in cash and issued approximately 7.6 million shares of CECO common stock to PMFG stockholders as consideration for the transaction. Based on the closing share price of PMFG common stock on September 2, 2015, the transaction was valued at approximately $137 million. Accounting for existing cash on hand and acquired PMFG debt, the net transaction value was approximately $121 million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with additional debt. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for further information on the additional debt. The results of this business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are reported within our Energy segment. The PMFG acquisition expands our end market segment reach, broadens our portfolio of products and strengthens our global geographic footprint, particularly in China, Europe and the Middle East. It is also a major step forward in our strategy to become a leader in customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry. We expect the acquisition to generate meaningful cost reduction synergies and global sales opportunities through significant operating and manufacturing synergies, as well as the opportunity to drive important recurring revenues and new highly engineered equipment through an installed equipment base of over $5 billion. It also provides us with sales opportunities in our core end markets and gives us greater critical scale. Operations Overview We operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management, finance, administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes. We use this model throughout our operations. This has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model. The Companys segment presidents manage our division managers who are responsible for successfully running their operations, that is, sales, gross margins, manufacturing, pricing, purchasing, safety, employee development and customer service excellence. The segment presidents work closely with our CEO on global growth strategies, operational excellence, and employee development. The headquarters (hub) focuses on enabling the core back office key functions for scale and efficiency, that is, accounting, payroll, human resources/benefits, information technology, safety support, audit controls, and administration. We have excellent organizational focus from headquarters throughout our divisional businesses with clarity and minimal duplicative work streams. We are structured for growth and will do future bolt on acquisitions. Our three reportable segments are: the Environmental segment, which produces various types of product recovery and air pollution control technologies, the Energy segment, which produces customized solutions for the power and petrochemical industry, and the Fluid Handling and Filtration segment, which produces high quality pump, filtration and fume exhaust solutions. It is through combining the efforts of some or all of these groups that we are able to offer complete turnkey systems to our customers and leverage operational efficiencies. Our contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers. Contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project. Our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage, which translates into higher net income. Our cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors including material prices and labor cost and availability. Changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins. We break down costs of sales into five categories. They are: LaborOur direct labor both in the shop and in the field; MaterialRaw material that we buy to build our products; EquipmentFans, motors, control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems; SubcontractsElectrical work, concrete work and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products; Factory overheadCosts of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products. In general, labor provides us the most flexibility in margin followed by material and equipment and subcontracts. Across our various product lines, the relative relationships of these factors change and cause variations in gross margin percentage. Material costs have also increased faster than labor costs, which also reduces gross margin percentage. 27 Selling and administrative expense principally includes sales payroll and related fringes, advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations. The majority of these expenses are fixed. We expect to leverage our fixed operating structure as we continue to grow our revenue. Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this MD&A that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this supplemental non GAAP financial information, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance, and which the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non GAAP financial measures of non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, non GAAP operating income, non GAAP operating margin, and non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include charges associated with the Companys acquisition and integration of recent acquisitions, including PMFG, and the items described below in Consolidated Results. The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. As a result of the Companys recently completed acquisitions, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with the acquisition and integration. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat these charges as special items in its future presentation of non GAAP results. See Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Year ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 367.4 $ 263.2 $ 197.3 Cost of goods sold 258.2 178.4 135.7 Gross profit $ 109.2 $ 84.8 $ 61.6 Percent of sales 29.7 % 32.2 % 31.2 % Selling and administrative $ 67.5 $ 51.4 $ 37.2 Percent of sales 18.4 % 19.5 % 18.9 % Acquisition and integration expense $ 7.9 $ 1.3 $ 7.2 Percent of sales 2.2 % 0.5 % 3.6 % Amortization and earn out expenses $ 25.6 $ 10.1 $ 6.7 Percent of sales 7.0 % 3.8 % 3.4 % Intangible asset impairment $ 3.3 $ $ Percent of sales 0.9 % Legal reserves $ $ 0.3 $ 3.5 Percent of sales 0.0 % 0.1 % 1.8 % Operating income $ 4.9 $ 21.7 $ 7.0 Percent of sales 1.3 % 8.2 % 3.5 % 28 On March 10, 2016, the Company furnished a Current Report on Form 8 K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included an earnings release issued that same day reporting results for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 thereto (the Earnings Release). Between the issuance of the Earnings Release and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company became aware of additional information affecting its final closing adjustments, which resulted in the Company recording, for the three month period ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in net sales of $2.7 million, a decrease in cost of goods sold of $0.3 million, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $2.0 million, resulting in a decrease in pre tax income of $0.4 million, which was offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $0.4 million. The net impact of these adjustments had no impact on net income or diluted earnings per share as initially reported for the year ended December 31, 2015. To compare operating performance between the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income and GAAP net income to exclude (1) acquisition and integration related expenses, including legal, accounting, and banking expenses, (2) amortization and contingent acquisition expenses, including amortization of acquisition related intangibles, retention, severance, and earn out expenses, (3) legal reserves, (4) inventory valuation and plant, property and equipment valuation adjustments related to the Met Pro and PMFG acquisitions, (5) intangible asset impairment, (6) foreign currency remeasurement with respect to intercompany loans, (7) write off of deferred financing fees associated with debt extinguishment, and (8) with respect to net income, associated tax benefits of these charges. The Company has adjusted GAAP gross profit to exclude inventory valuation and plant, property and equipment valuation adjustments related to the Met Pro and PMFG acquisitions. See Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures above. The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross profit margin to non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating margin, and GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. to non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp.: Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Gross profit as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 109.2 $ 84.8 $ 61.6 Gross profit margin in accordance with GAAP 29.7 % 32.2 % 31.2 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Non GAAP gross profit $ 110.3 $ 85.4 $ 62.9 Non GAAP Gross profit margin 30.0 % 32.4 % 31.9 % Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 4.9 $ 21.7 $ 7.0 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP 1.3 % 8.2 % 3.5 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Acquisition and integration expenses 7.9 1.3 7.2 Amortization and earn out expenses 25.6 10.1 6.8 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 0.3 3.5 Non GAAP operating income $ 42.8 $ 34.0 $ 25.8 Non GAAP Operating margin 11.6 % 12.9 % 13.1 % 29 Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net (loss) income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. as reported in accordance with GAAP $ (5.6 ) $ 13.1 $ 6.6 Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 1.1 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.6 0.6 0.2 Acquisition and integration expenses 7.9 1.3 7.2 Amortization and earn out expenses 25.6 10.1 6.8 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 0.3 3.5 Deferred financing fee adjustment 0.3 Foreign currency remeasurement 2.5 2.9 (1.1 ) Tax benefit of expenses (7.1 ) (3.7 ) (4.6 ) Non GAAP net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. $ 28.0 $ 24.6 $ 19.7 Non GAAP Net income 7.6 % 9.3 % 10.0 % Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Consolidated sales in 2015 were $367.4 million compared with $263.2 million in 2014, an increase of $104.2 million. The increase in sales was due primarily to the acquisitions of HEE in mid August 2014, SAT at the end of September 2014, Emtrol at the beginning of November 2014, Zhongli at the end of December 2014, and PMFG at the beginning of September 2015. These acquisitions contributed an incremental $103.0 million of sales in 2015. Gross profit increased by $24.4 million, or 28.8%, to $109.2 million in 2015 compared with $84.8 million in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.7% in 2015 compared with 32.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit on a dollar basis was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions, which contributed $27.1 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in overall gross profit percentage due to product mix. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $110.3 million or 30.0% as a percentage of sales for 2015, an increase of $24.9 million on a dollar basis compared with non GAAP gross margin of $85.4 million or 32.4% as a percentage of sales in 2014. Selling and administrative expenses were $67.5 million in 2015 compared with $51.4 million in 2014. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.4% in 2015 compared with 19.5% in 2014. Acquisition and integration expenses of $7.9 million in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2014 relate to acquisition activities, which include legal, accounting, and banking expenses. Amortization and earn out expense was $25.6 million in 2015 and $10.1 million in 2014. This increase was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Of the increase in 2015, $11.2 million is an adjustment to the fair value of the earn out from the Zhongli acquisition. The fair value adjustment to the earn out was the result of Zhongli performing above initial acquisition date operational expectations. Legal reserves of $0.3 million in 2014 relate to the settlement of the Valero lawsuit. There were no such reserves in 2015. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Operating income for 2015 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $16.8 million from $21.7 million in 2014. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2015 was 1.3% compared with 8.2% for 2014. The decrease in operating income was attributable to the aforementioned acquisitions, and associated acquisition and integration expenses, as well as the amortization and earn out expenses. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP operating income was $42.8 million for 2015, an increase of $8.8 million from 2014. Non GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2015 was 11.6% compared with 12.9% for 2014, down slightly year over year. Other expense for 2015 was $2.1 million compared with $2.3 million in 2014, and was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses in 2015 and 2014. The expense in 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to a translation remeasurement on U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany debt at our subsidiary in the Netherlands. 30 Interest expense increased to $6.0 million in 2015 from $3.1 million in 2014, due to higher debt levels in 2015, which debt was incurred in connection with the PMFG and Emtrol acquisitions. Income tax expense was $2.6 million and $3.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2015 was (85.2)% compared with 19.3% in 2014. The effective tax rate was adversely impacted $3.9 million by nondeductible earnout expenses, $1.4 million by nondeductible deal costs related to the PMFG acquisition, as well as $1.2 million of certain permanent differences, which more than offset the benefits of $1.5 million from foreign rate differences and $1.3 million of changes in uncertain tax position reserves. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Consolidated sales in 2014 were $263.2 million compared with $197.3 million in 2013, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in sales was primarily due to the acquisitions of Aarding at the end of February 2013, Met Pro at the end of August 2013, HEE in mid August 2014, SAT at the end of September 2014, and Emtrol at the beginning of November 2014. These acquisitions contributed an incremental $71.6 million of sales in 2014. Gross profit increased by $23.2 million, or 37.7%, to $84.8 million in 2014 compared with $61.6 million in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.2% in 2014 compared with 31.2% in 2013. The increase gross profit was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $85.4 million or 32.4% as a percentage of sales for 2014, an increase of $22.5 million compared with non GAAP gross margin of $62.9 million or 31.9% as a percentage of sales in 2013. Selling and administrative expenses were $51.4 million in 2014 compared with $37.1 million in 2013. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Acquisition and integration expenses of $1.3 million in 2014 and $7.2 million in 2013 relate to acquisition activities, which include legal, accounting, and banking expenses. Amortization and earnout expense was $10.1 million in 2014 and $6.8 million in 2013. This increase was the result of the aforementioned acquisitions. Legal reserves of $0.3 million in 2014 relate to the settlement of the Valero lawsuit. Legal reserves of $3.5 million in 2013 relate to the settlement of the Sheet Workers Local Union No. 80 claim. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Operating income for 2014 was $21.7 million, an increase of $14.7 million from $7.0 million in 2013. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2014 was 8.2% compared with 3.5% for 2013. The increase in operating income was attributable to the aforementioned acquisitions. On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP operating income was $34.0 million for 2014, an increase of $8.2 million from 2013. Non GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2014 was 12.9% compared with 13.1% for 2013, which is essentially flat year over year. Other (expense) income for 2014 was $(2.3) million compared with $1.0 million in 2013, and was comprised of foreign currency transaction losses in 2014 and foreign currency transaction gains in 2013. The expense in 2014 and income in 2013 is primarily attributable to a translation remeasurement on U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany debt at our subsidiary in the Netherlands. Interest expense increased to $3.1 million in 2014 from $1.5 million in 2013, due to higher debt levels in 2014, which debt was incurred in connection with the Met Pro and Emtrol acquisitions. Income tax expense (benefit) was $3.1 million in 2014 compared with $(0.1) million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 19.3% compared with (1.6)% in 2013. Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2013 is a $2.4 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2013. This credit was not factored in the 2012 tax provision because it was not evaluated until 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, the effective tax rate is beneficially impacted by the domestic production activities deduction, offset by nondeductible deal costs related to the Met Pro acquisition. 31 Business Segments The Companys operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and presented in three reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through to the Income from operations line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amounts presented in the Net Sales table below and in the following comments regarding our net sales at the reportable business segment level exclude both intra segment and inter segment net sales. The Income (loss) from Operations table and corresponding comments regarding operating income at the reportable segment level include both intra segment and inter segment operating income. 2015 2014 2013 Net Sales (less intra , inter segment sales) Environmental Segment $ 158,371 $ 127,707 $ 101,150 Energy Segment 142,150 70,285 69,355 Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment 67,610 65,638 25,199 Corporate and Other (1) (709 ) (413 ) 1,613 Net sales $ 367,422 $ 263,217 $ 197,317 (1) Includes adjustment for revenue on intercompany jobs. 2015 2014 2013 Income (Loss) from Operations Environmental Segment $ 17,021 $ 16,803 $ 15,422 Energy Segment 3,488 7,799 9,336 Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment 11,741 13,188 1,443 Corporate and Other (2) (26,592 ) (14,297 ) (17,756 ) Eliminations (709 ) (1,830 ) (1,473 ) Income from operations $ 4,949 $ 21,663 $ 6,972 (2) Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology, acquisition and integration expenses, and other general and administrative corporate expenses. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Environmental Segment Our Environmental segment net sales increased $30.7 million to $158.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $127.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 24.0%. The increase is due to the HEE and Emtrol acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $9.0 million and $23.9 million in net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income from the Environmental segment increased $0.2 million to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $16.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 1.2%. The increase was due in part to the HEE and Emtrol acquisitions, which accounted for an incremental $0.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was partially offset by declines in operating income of legacy businesses. Energy Segment Our Energy segment net sales increased $71.9 million to $142.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $70.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 102.3%. The increase is primarily due to the PMFG and Zhongli acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $40.8 million and $28.1 million in net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income from the Energy segment decreased $4.3 million to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 55.1%. The decrease was due primarily to earnout expense of $11.2 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of the earn out liability associated with the Zhongli acquisition (see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information). This decrease was partially offset by PMFG operating income of $2.0 million, and Zhongli operating income (exclusive of the earnout expense discussed above) of $5.2 million in 2015. 32 Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment Our FHF segment net sales increased $2.0 million to $67.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 3.0%. The increase in revenue from 2014 to 2015 is due to sales volume growth within the segment year over year. Operating income from the FHF segment decreased $1.5 million to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $13.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of $2.9 million related to two tradename intangible assets within the segment, partially offset by an increase due to gross margin improvements year over year. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Environmental Segment Our Environmental segment net sales increased $26.5 million to $127.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $101.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 26.3%. The increase is primarily due to the Met Pro and Emtrol acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $17.1 million and $9.8 million in net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income from the Environmental segment increased $1.4 million to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $15.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 9.0%. The increase was due in part to the Met Pro and Emtrol acquisitions, which contributed an incremental $3.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by lower operating income from legacy operations of $2.9 million due to lower gross margins. Energy Segment Our Energy segment net sales increased $0.9 million to $70.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $69.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 1.3%. Operating income from the Energy segment decreased $1.5 million to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 16.1%. The decrease was due in part to a decline in overall margins. Fluid Handling and Filtration Segment Our FHF segment net sales increased $40.4 million to $65.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 160.3%. The increase is primarily due to the Met Pro acquisition, which accounted for an incremental $39.3 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining $1.1 million increase was due to an increase in sales volumes in the legacy operations. Operating income from the FHF segment increased $11.8 million to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was due primarily to the Met Pro acquisition, which accounted for and incremental $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining $0.9 million increase was due to higher gross margins in legacy operations. 33 Non GAAP Measures for the Three Months Ended December 31 The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin to non GAAP gross profit and non GAAP gross profit margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non GAAP operating income and non GAAP operating margin: Three Months Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net sales as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 101.2 $ 76.1 $ 68.7 Gross profit as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 30.8 $ 22.6 $ 21.5 Gross profit margin in accordance with GAAP 30.4 % 29.7 % 31.3 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 0.7 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.1 0.1 0.1 Non GAAP gross profit $ 31.4 $ 22.7 $ 22.3 Non GAAP gross profit margin 31.0 % 29.8 % 32.4 % Three Months Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ (0.3 ) $ 3.8 $ 3.7 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP (0.3 )% 5.0 % 5.4 % Inventory valuation adjustment 0.5 0.7 Plant, property and equipment valuation adjustment 0.1 0.1 0.1 Acquisition and integration expenses 0.9 0.9 0.6 Amortization and earn out expenses 5.6 2.8 3.3 Intangible asset impairment 3.3 Legal reserves 1.0 Non GAAP operating income $ 10.1 $ 7.6 $ 9.4 Non GAAP operating margin 10.0 % 10.0 % 13.6 % On an as adjusted basis, non GAAP gross profit was $31.4 million or 31.0% as a percentage of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $8.7 million compared with non GAAP gross margin of $22.7 million or 29.8% as a percentage of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2014.

Backlog Our backlog consists of the amount of revenue we expect from complete performance of uncompleted, signed, firm fixed price contracts that have not been completed for products and services we expect to substantially deliver within the next 12 months. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $211.2 million compared with $140.1 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in backlog at December 31, 2015 was a result of the acquisition of PMFG, which represented $80.5 million of our backlog at December 31, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Credit Facility (defined below). Our principal uses of cash are operating costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, dividends, working capital and other corporate requirements, including acquisitions.

On November 18, 2014, the Company amended the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment (i) certain lenders provided an additional term loan under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million and certain lenders increased their revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million, and (ii) the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (a) modify the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA to include certain pro forma adjustments related to certain acquisitions and other transactions, (b) modify the Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant and (c) permit additional investments in foreign subsidiaries and additional indebtedness by foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds from the additional term loan were used primarily to finance the acquisition of Emtrol and related expenses. Additionally, the Company has the option to obtain additional commitments for either the U.S. dollar revolving credit facility or the term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50.0 million. On September 3, 2015, concurrent with the closing of the PMFG acquisition, the Company amended the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the Lenders provided a term loan under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $170.0 million and the Lenders decreased their senior secured U.S. dollar revolving credit commitments to the aggregate principal amount of $60.5 million. All other provisions of the agreement remained substantially unchanged. The proceeds from the increased term loan were used primarily to (i) finance the cash portion of the PMFG purchase price, (ii) pay off certain outstanding indebtedness of the 35 Company and its subsidiaries (including certain indebtedness of PMFG and its subsidiaries), and (iii) pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the amendment to the Credit Agreement and the PMFG acquisition. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3.75 and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of more than 1.25. Per the Credit Agreement, the consolidated leverage ratio is set to decrease to 3.50 by December 31, 2016, and then decrease again to 3.00 by December 31, 2017. The consolidated leverage ratio will then remain at 3.00 until the end Credit Agreement term. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and the occurrence of an event of default could result in an increased interest rate equal to 2.0% above the applicable interest rate for loans, the acceleration of the Companys obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement and an obligation of the subsidiary guarantors to repay the full amount of the Companys borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement. See Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on the Companys debt facilities.

The $5.1 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to a few unfavorable net working capital items in 2015 compared with 2014. The incremental cash used was comprised of $15.6 million in accounts receivable, $3.5 million in inventories, $8.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $1.7 million in other liabilities and $0.2 million in deferred charges and other assets. The incremental cash provided was comprised of $4.4 million in costs in excess of billings, $4.3 million in billings in excess of costs, $1.2 million in income taxes payable, and $3.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets. In 2014, $17.7 million of cash was provided by operating activities as compared with $24.2 million provided in 2013. The $6.5 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to a few unfavorable net working capital items in 2014 compared with 2013. The incremental cash used was comprised of $6.6 million in costs in excess of billings, $2.2 million in billings in excess of costs, $1.2 million in income taxes payable, $4.7 million in other liabilities and $2.5 million in accrued litigation settlement. The incremental cash provided was comprised of $2.5 million in accounts receivable, $2.0 million in inventories, $2.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $1.5 million in prepaid expenses and other assets. In 2015, $35.0 million of cash was used in investing activities as compared with $37.8 million in 2014. Investing activities in 2015 were comprised of $37.5 million cash paid for acquisitions and $0.8 million for capital expenditures for property and equipment and offset by $3.2 million proceeds from sale of property and equipment, as compared with $44.4 million cash paid for acquisitions, $7.7 million proceeds from sale of equipment and $1.2 million for capital expenditures of property and equipment in 2014. In 2014, $37.8 million of cash was used in investing activities as compared with $105.6 million in 2013. Investing activities in 2014 were comprised of $44.4 million cash paid for acquisitions and $1.2 million for capital expenditures for property and equipment and offset by $7.7 million proceeds from sale of property and equipment, as compared with $104.4 million cash paid for acquisitions, $0.2 million proceeds from sale of equipment and $1.4 million for capital expenditures of property and equipment in 2013. Financing activities in 2015 provided net cash of $38.9 million, which consisted primarily of net borrowings of $57.6 million and proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options of $0.2 million, less dividends paid to our shareholders of $8.0 million, cash used to pay deferred financing fees of $2.9 million, and earnout payments of $2.5 million. Financing activities in 2014 provided net cash of $16.3 million, which consisted primarily of net borrowings of $23.2 million and proceeds from exercise of options of $1.4 million, less dividends paid to our shareholders of $5.9 million, earnout payments of $1.4 million, and cash used to repurchase common stock of $1.0 million. Financing activities in 2013 provided net cash of $81.1 million, which consisted primarily of net borrowings of $89.1 million and proceeds from exercise of options of $1.4 million, less dividends paid to our common shareholders of $4.3 million, cash used to repurchase common stock of $2.4 million, and deferred financing fees paid of $2.7 million. 37 Our dividend policy and the payment of cash dividends under that policy are subject to the Board of Directors continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends are in the best interest of the Companys shareholders. Future dividends and the dividend policy may be changed or cancelled at the Companys discretion at any time. Payment of dividends is also subject to the continuing compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility. During 2015 and 2014, our Board declared the following quarterly cash dividends on our common stock: Dividend Per Share Record Date Payment Date $0.066 December 16, 2015 December 30, 2015 $0.066 September 18, 2015 September 30, 2015 $0.066 June 12, 2015 June 26, 2015 $0.066 March 19, 2015 March 31, 2015 $0.060 December 19, 2014 December 30, 2014 $0.060 September 16, 2014 September 30, 2014 $0.060 June 13, 2014 June 27, 2014 $0.050 March 19, 2014 March 31, 2014 On March 9, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.066 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 30, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2016. Effective August 13, 2012, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), under which the Company may issue up to 750,000 shares of common stock. The Plan provides a way for interested shareholders to increase their holdings in our common stock. Participation in the Plan is strictly voluntary and is open only to existing shareholders. The Company may periodically issue new shares of common stock under the Plan. When we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit. In connection with the Met Pro, Emtrol, and PMFG acquisitions, we took on significant additional debt to fund these transactions. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Employee Benefit Obligations Based on current assumptions, estimated contributions of $29,000 may be required in 2016 for the pension plan and $27,000 for the retiree healthcare plan. The amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements, among other things and, accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments. Currently, our pension plan is under funded. As a result, absent major increases in long term interest rates, above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements, we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 38 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt $ 181,557 $ 19,494 $ 31,876 $ 130,187 $ Interest expense (estimated) 23,814 5,890 10,091 7,833 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 93,412 93,412 Pension and post retirement obligations (2) 5,360 56 2,916 2,388 Operating lease obligations 17,127 3,952 5,524 2,562 5,089 Contingent liabilities related to acquisitions 32,670 14,756 17,914 Totals $ 353,940 $ 137,560 $ 68,321 $ 142,970 $ 5,089 (1) Primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts. (2) Future expected obligations under the Companys pension and post retirement plans are included in the contractual cash obligations table above, up to, but not more than five years. The Companys pension and post retirement plan policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of the pension and post retirement cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. The Company projects that it will contribute $56,000 to its pension and post retirement plans during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity. Use of Estimates Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, bad debts, share based compensation, income taxes, earnouts, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts, which are primarily accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Percentage completion is measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared with estimated total contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs include direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. This method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods. The judgments and estimates involved include managements ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete, among other factors, at each financial reporting period. In addition, certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project, over which we have no or limited control, and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors, changes in the scope of the project, weather, and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. For contracts where the duration is short, total contract revenue is insignificant, or reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made, revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis, when risk and title passes to the customer, which is generally upon shipment of product. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 39 Inventories The Companys inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out inventory costing method as well as the last in, first out method. Approximately 13% of our inventory is valued on the last in, first out method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the Companys forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to the Companys forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvementsgenerally five to 40 years; machinery and equipmentgenerally two to 15 years). Intangible assets Indefinite life intangible assets are comprised of tradenames, while finite life intangible assets are comprised of patents, employment agreements, technology, customer lists, noncompetition agreements, tradenames, and backlog. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives of 17 years for patents, three years for employment agreements, seven to 10 years for technology, five to 20 years for customer lists, five years for noncompetition agreements, 10 years for tradenames, and one year for backlog. Long lived assets Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long lived assets remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its indefinite life intangible assets. As a part of its annual assessment, typically, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated by the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its calculated implied fair value. For the 2015 annual assessment, given the lower than expected results for certain reporting units, we determined that a quantitative assessment of fair value for all indefinite life intangible assets using the relief from royalty method was appropriate. During 2015, our annual impairment test indicated that three of our indefinite lived tradenames were impaired. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment charge in our financial results of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its goodwill on a reporting unit level, at or below the operating segment level. In performing the goodwill impairment assessment, the carrying values of the Companys reporting units are compared with their estimated fair values, as calculated using a weighting of the income method 40 and the market method. As a part of its annual assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the Company does not need to proceed to the traditional quantitative two step goodwill test for that reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its calculated implied fair value. During 2015, management changed the annual impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1. For 2015, the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test as described in FASB ASC 350 20 35 was performed for all reporting units, except for the recently acquired PMFG reporting unit, as there were no events or changes in operations since September that would indicate possible impairment. Under the first step, the Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a weighting of the income method and the market method on a 50/50 basis. In prior years, the Company used the income method. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue, projected operational profit and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on the step 1 analysis, the resultant estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded. For additional information on goodwill impairment testing results, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Tax credits and other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of managements intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries amounted to $40.2 million. Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company will be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is estimated to be approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We sponsor a pension plan for certain employees. We also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before January 1, 1990. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. These factors include key assumptions, such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate 41 these liabilities. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future. An analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized. For example, one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. At December 31, 2015, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and the annual pension expense by approximately $2,000. Additionally, a 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the pension expense by approximately $61,000. Share Based Compensation We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and recognize this cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide the services, based on the fair value of the award at the date of the grant as determined by the Black Scholes valuation method for stock options, or current publicly traded market price on the grant date for restricted stock units. Other significant accounting policies Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives. New Accounting Pronouncements New Financial Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 02, Leases. ASU 2016 02 establishes a right of use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016 02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 02 on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015 17 eliminates the prior US GAAP guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. The amendments in ASU 2015 17 require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015 17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. In order to simplify presentation of deferred tax balances, the Company adopted this standard prospectively for the year ended December 31, 2015. Years prior to the year ended December 31, 2015 were not retrospectively adjusted. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments. ASU 2015 16 requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, the amendments in the ASU would require an entity to disclose (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the nature and amount of measurement period adjustments recognized in the current period, including separately the amounts in current period income statement line items that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015 16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2015 16 on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015 11 requires inventory within the scope of the ASU (e.g. first in, first out (FIFO) or average cost) to be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory excluded from the scope of the ASU (i.e., last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method) will continue to be measured at the lower of cost or market. The ASU also amends some of the other guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, to more 42 clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory. However, those amendments are not intended to result in any changes to current practice. ASU 2015 11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015 03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The FASB issued the ASU to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, and to align with other existing FASB guidance. ASU 2015 03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company early adopted this ASU in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the adoption, all debt related costs are now presented as a direct offset to the long term debt, and therefore $0.6 million in deferred financing costs were reclassified from Deferred Charges and Other Assets to Debt, Less Current Portion at December 31, 2014 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014 09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers. ASU 2014 09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition principles under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014 09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to for those goods or services using a defined five step process. More judgment and estimates may be required to achieve this principle than under existing GAAP. ASU 2014 09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect upon initial adoption recognized at the date of adoption, which includes additional footnote disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014 09 on the Companys consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method of adoption. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. For the Company, these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates. We do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes. However, we do have an interest rate swap in place as of December 31, 2015 to hedge against a portion of our interest rate exposure related to debt indexed to LIBOR market rates. See Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information on this interest rate swap. The carrying value of the Companys total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2015 was $177.3 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease (increase) in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase (decrease) in the Companys estimated weighted average borrowing rate at December 31, 2015. Most of the interest on the Companys debt is indexed to either the LIBOR or EURIBOR market rates. The estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% change in the estimated weighted average borrowing rate, excluding the portion of debt which has an interest rate fixed by the interest rate swap described above, at December 31, 2015 is $0.4 million on an annual basis. The Company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, Canada, the Peoples Republic of China, Mexico, United Kingdom, Singapore, and Chile. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings. On March 31, 2014, our subsidiary in the Netherlands entered into a one month foreign exchange forward contract to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on a U.S. dollar denominated transaction totaling $5.5 million. The contract expired prior to December 31, 2015 and there are no such contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency, we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the year ending December 31, 2016. 43
