ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain certain statements relating to future results, which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated, depending on a variety of factors, including those factors discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors." Should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described. Those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. General Overview During fiscal 2015, we executed on a comprehensive strategic plan that included: The sale of our Telair Cargo Group for cash of $714 million, resulting in pre tax gains of $198.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (and $27.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from the receipt of contingent consideration); A decision to divest our Precision Systems Manufacturing business; The exit of certain product lines and inventories in our aviation services businesses that were underperforming or not part of our strategy going forward; The reduction of our total debt by $480 million; The return of capital to shareholders through $151.5 million in common stock repurchases and $12.5 million of dividends. The divestiture of these manufacturing businesses allowed us to narrow our strategy to focus on our best in class aviation and expeditionary services. In fiscal 2016, our Aviation Services segment succeeded in expanding existing customer relationships in distribution and securing new program work with multiple international carriers. In our Expeditionary Services segment, we have completed the successful start up of our new contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defense providing search and rescue services in the Falkland Islands. As we enter fiscal 2017, we remain in a strong financial position to further execute on our strategy as a best in class aviation and expeditionary services company. Our cash on hand plus unused capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility was $409 million at May 31, 2016. We expect to invest opportunistically in expanding our comprehensive suite of services to the global commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We report our activities in two business segments: Aviation Services and Expeditionary Services. The Aviation Services segment consists of businesses that provide spares and maintenance support for aircraft operated by our commercial and government/defense customers. Sales in the Aviation Services segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We provide customized inventory supply chain management, performance based logistics programs, aircraft 20 Table of Contents component repair management services, and aircraft modifications. The segment also includes repair, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft, landing gear and components. We also sell and lease used commercial aircraft (exclusively through joint ventures following the sale of our last two wholly owned aircraft in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015). Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, and overhead. The Expeditionary Services segment consists of businesses that provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), foreign governments and non governmental organizations. Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment are derived from the delivery of airlift services to mostly government and defense customers and the design and manufacture of pallets, shelters, and containers used to support the U.S. militarys requirements for a mobile and agile force. We also provide system integration services for specialized command and control systems. Cost of sales consists principally of aircraft maintenance costs, depreciation, the cost of material to manufacture products, direct labor and overhead. Our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from sales. The assets and certain expenses related to corporate activities are not allocated to the segments. Our reportable segments are aligned principally around differences in products and services. Business Trends and Outlook for Fiscal 2017 Consolidated sales for fiscal 2016 increased $68.3 million or 4.3% compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in sales of $108.9 million or 8.3% in our Aviation Services segment. This growth was driven by higher volumes in distribution of $58.6 million and increased MRO sales of $53.2 million partially offset by lower demand in aftermarket parts trading of $34.2 million. Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $40.6 million or 14.6% from the prior year period due to lower demand for mobility products as the DoD reduced its purchases of these products due to reduced troop activity. For fiscal 2017, we expect to see continued strength in our Aviation Services segment given its strong positions in the growing global aviation market. We believe there continues to be a favorable trend by both commercial and government and defense customers for comprehensive supply chain and maintenance programs, as these customers continue to seek ways to reduce their operating cost structure. While defense budgets are expected to remain under pressure due to budgetary constraints and the current geopolitical environment, we see ongoing demand for our low cost solutions, services, and products in our Expeditionary Services segment. For the fiscal 2017, we expect the Companys consolidated sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 Sales and gross profit for our two business segments for the two years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: For the Year Ended May 31, 2016 2015 % Change Sales: Aviation Services Commercial $ 1,003.5 $ 985.7 1.8 % Defense 421.5 330.4 27.6 % $ 1,425.0 $ 1,316.1 8.3 % Expeditionary Services Commercial $ 16.5 $ 18.8 (12.2 )% Defense 221.1 259.4 (14.8 )% $ 237.6 $ 278.2 (14.6 )% For the Year Ended May 31, 2016 2015 % Change Gross Profit: Aviation Services Commercial $ 157.5 $ 93.5 68.4 % Defense 72.3 50.3 43.7 % $ 229.8 $ 143.8 59.8 % Expeditionary Services Commercial $ (0.1 ) $ 1.5 (106.7 )% Defense 7.2 14.0 (48.6 )% $ 7.1 $ 15.5 (54.2 )% Aviation Services Segment Sales in the Aviation Services segment increased $108.9 million or 8.3% over the prior year due to a $91.1 million or 27.6% increase in sales to government and defense customers. The increase in sales to government and defense customers was primarily attributable to increased volumes in both programs of $59.0 million and distribution of $27.5 million largely from the continued ramp up of programs announced in the second half of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016, sales in this segment to commercial customers increased $17.8 million or 1.8% over the prior year primarily due to higher MRO sales of $49.8 million and higher volumes in distribution of $31.2 million. These increases were partially offset by lower demand in aftermarket parts trading of $37.2 million. In fiscal 2015, we sold our last two wholly owned aircraft for $11.0 million. Cost of sales in Aviation Services increased $22.9 million or 2.0% over the prior year primarily due to growth in sales volume partially offset by charges and other actions in fiscal 2015 that did not occur in fiscal 2016, including that in fiscal 2015 (i) we recognized an impairment charge of $19.5 million for rotable assets and inventory supporting certain product lines we exited in our landing gear business, (ii) we sold our last two remaining wholly owned aircraft in our aircraft leasing portfolio resulting in a loss of $14.8 million, and (iii) we took actions to address underperforming inventories and equipment available for lease resulting in losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 of $24.0 million. 22 Table of Contents Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment increased $86.0 million or 59.8% over the prior year. Gross profit on sales to commercial customers increased $64.0 million or 68.4% over the prior year primarily driven by the fiscal 2015 charges and other actions discussed above. The gross profit margin on sales to commercial customers increased to 15.7% compared to 9.5% in the prior year which was also attributable to the fiscal 2015 actions discussed above. Gross profit in this segment on sales to government and defense customers increased $22.0 million or 43.7% over the prior year with programs contributing the majority of the increase. Gross profit margin increased from 15.2% to 17.2% primarily due to these increased volumes. Since 2009, we have served as a subcontractor providing supply chain services and logistics support for the prime contractor on the KC10 Extender Contractor Logistics Support Program ("KC10 Program"). In February 2016, we submitted our final bid on the new KC10 Program contract, and in June 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the contract to a competitor. We have filed a protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Due to the pending protest and the routine transition period of the services to the new provider, we expect to continue to provide KC10 logistics services through late fiscal 2017. Average annual revenue and gross profit recognized over the last three years for our KC10 logistics support services was $115.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Expeditionary Services Segment Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $40.6 million or 14.6% from the prior year period. The decrease in sales was driven by a decrease of $40.7 million due to lower demand for mobility products as the DoD reduced its purchases of these products due to reduced troop activity. Cost of sales in Expeditionary Services decreased $32.2 million or 12.3% from the prior year primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and by charges and other actions in fiscal 2015 that did not occur in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 cost of sales included impairment charges of $8.9 million related to expeditionary airlift services for inventory, rotable assets and aircraft. Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $8.1 million or 54.2% from the prior year period. Lower sales of mobility products decreased gross profit $8.5 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Earnings from Aircraft Joint Ventures Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.6 million in fiscal 2016 or 0.4% from the prior year as fiscal 2015 included asset impairment charges on corporate assets of $3.5 million and severance costs of $1.7 million which did not occur in fiscal 2016. Incremental investments in business development activities in fiscal 2016 partially offset the benefit of the non recurring fiscal 2015 costs. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Interest Expense On April 30, 2015, we redeemed our $325 million 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 for $370.6 million. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $44.9 million comprised of a make whole premium of $45.6 million and unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.2 million, partially offset by an unamortized net premium of $6.9 million. Interest expense decreased $20.1 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the redemption of the Senior Notes. Income Taxes Our fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 31.7% compared to 34.3% in the prior year period. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 includes a benefit of $2.5 million related to the correction of prior year immaterial errors. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 Sales and gross profit for our two business segments for the two years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: For the Year Ended May 31, 2015 2014 % Change Sales: Aviation Services Commercial $ 985.7 $ 919.9 7.2 % Defense 330.4 311.3 6.1 % $ 1,316.1 $ 1,231.2 6.9 % Expeditionary Services Commercial $ 18.8 $ 11.7 60.7 % Defense 259.4 466.2 (44.4 )% $ 278.2 $ 477.9 (41.8 )% For the Year Ended May 31, 2015 2014 % Change Gross Profit: Aviation Services Commercial $ 93.5 $ 137.6 (32.0 )% Defense 50.3 34.9 44.1 % $ 143.8 $ 172.5 (16.6 )% Expeditionary Services Commercial $ 1.5 $ 1.0 50.0 % Defense 14.0 115.4 (87.9 )% $ 15.5 $ 116.4 (86.7 )% Aviation Services Segment Sales in the Aviation Services segment increased $84.9 million or 6.9% over the prior year due to a $65.8 million or 7.2% increase in sales to commercial customers. The increase in sales to commercial customers was primarily attributable to increased volumes in both programs of $40.5 million and distribution of $27.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes in our MRO facilities driven by overcapacity in the market which reduced sales by $13.7 million from the prior period. In addition, a significant engineering services program ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 with sales of $14.6 million in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, sales in this segment to government and defense customers increased $19.1 million or 6.1% over the prior year primarily due to increased volume in distribution of $25.1 million and higher volumes in programs of $21.4 million. These increases were largely offset by no deliveries of aircraft to government customers in fiscal 2015 compared to the delivery of three aircraft to government customers in fiscal 2014. Cost of sales in Aviation Services increased $113.6 million or 10.7% over the prior year primarily due to growth in sales volume discussed above and fiscal 2015 charges and other actions to address underperforming inventories and assets no longer part of our strategy going forward. These actions included an impairment charge of $19.5 million for rotable assets and inventory supporting certain product 24 Table of Contents lines we exited in our landing gear business, the sale of our last two remaining wholly owned aircraft in our aircraft leasing portfolio resulting in a loss of $14.8 million, and actions to address underperforming inventories and equipment available for lease resulting in losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 of $24.0 million. Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $28.7 million or 16.6% from the prior year. Gross profit on sales to commercial customers decreased $44.1 million or 32.0% from the prior year primarily driven by the actions discussed above related to underperforming inventories and divesting assets no longer part of our strategy going forward. The gross profit margin on sales to commercial customers decreased to 9.5% compared to 15.0% in the prior year primarily as a result of the actions discussed above and a decline in gross profit margins in our MRO businesses due to reduced volumes. Gross profit in this segment on sales to government and defense customers increased $15.4 million or 44.1% over the prior year with stronger volumes in distribution and programs contributing the majority of the increase. Gross profit margin increased from 11.2% to 15.2% primarily due to these increased volumes. Expeditionary Services Segment Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $199.7 million or 41.8% from the prior year period. The decrease in sales was due to a $155.5 million decrease in sales from expeditionary airlift services related to the reduction in aircraft positions in Afghanistan. Lower demand for mobility products represented the remainder of the decrease in sales in the Expeditionary Services segment as the DoD reduced its purchases of these products due to reduced troop activity. Cost of sales in Expeditionary Services decreased $98.8 million or 27.3% from the prior year primarily due to the decrease in sales volume discussed above partially offset by impairment charges of $8.9 million related to expeditionary airlift services for inventory, rotable assets and aircraft. Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $100.9 million or 86.7% from the prior year period with the reduction in aircraft positions for expeditionary airlift services comprising the majority of the decrease in gross profit. The lower sales volumes at our mobility products business contributed $18.4 million to the gross profit decrease. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Earnings from Aircraft Joint Ventures Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.1 million in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of asset impairment charges on corporate assets of $3.5 million, severance costs of $1.7 million and incremental investments in business development activities. These incremental expenses were partially offset by the realization of benefits from the cost control measures implemented by the Company during fiscal 2014. Earnings from aircraft joint ventures decreased $2.8 million primarily attributable to the Companys share of the loss from the sale of one aircraft from our aircraft joint venture portfolio. Income Taxes Our fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 34.3% compared to 32.0% in the prior year period. Our fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate for continuing operations included a $2.6 million reduction in income tax expense related to changes in estimates originally used in the tax provision which were adjusted to actual on the federal income tax return. In addition, our higher taxable income in fiscal 2014 provided a greater tax benefit of $1.6 million related to the Domestic Production Activities Deduction in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 199. 25  Table of Contents Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Interest Expense On April 30, 2015, we redeemed our $325 million 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 for $370.6 million. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $44.9 million comprised of a make whole premium of $45.6 million and unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.2 million, partially offset by an unamortized net premium of $6.9 million. Interest expense decreased $1.8 million in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the redemption of the Senior Notes. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Our operating activities are funded and commitments met through the generation of cash from operations. Periodically, we may raise capital through common stock and debt financings in the public or private markets. In addition to these cash sources, our current capital resources include an unsecured credit facility. We continually evaluate various financing arrangements, including the issuance of common stock or debt, which would allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth on commercially reasonable terms. Our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the overall health of the credit markets, general economic conditions, airline industry conditions, geo political events, and our operating performance. Our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and changes in working capital. At May 31, 2016, our liquidity and capital resources included cash of $31.2 million and working capital of $544.1 million. On March 24, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to our Revolving Credit Facility dated April 12, 2011, as amended, with various financial institutions, as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility as in effect prior to the Amendment, the aggregate revolving credit commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility was $475 million. The Amendment increased the aggregate revolving credit commitment from $475 million to $500 million and provided that the Company, under certain circumstances, may request an increase to the revolving credit commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $250 million, not to exceed $750 million in total. The Amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility by approximately two years to March 24, 2020; deleted the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio; and added a minimum interest coverage ratio. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect prior to the Amendment bore interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate plus 125 to 225 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 25 to 125 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan. The Amendment generally reduced the interest rate on borrowings by 25 basis points. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility subsequent to the Amendment bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate plus 100 to 200 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 0 to 100 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan. Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at May 31, 2016 were $110.0 million and there were approximately $12.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced the availability of this facility to $377.7 million. There are no other terms or covenants limiting the availability of this facility. We also had $4.4 million available under foreign lines of credit at May 31, 2016. We intend to retire maturities due in fiscal 2017 through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 26 Table of Contents At May 31, 2016, we complied with all financial and other covenants under each of our financing arrangements. Cash Flows Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided from operating activities continuing operations was $30.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $68.6 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $38.2 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities including income tax payments of $35.7 million in fiscal 2016. In addition, inventory and accounts receivable increased $31.5 million in Aviation Services driven by sales growth in fiscal 2016 of 6.9% over the prior fiscal year. The sales growth was principally due to new contract wins in programs and distribution. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities continuing operations was $47.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities continuing operations of $7.2 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $54.3 million over the comparable prior period was attributable to additional capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 primarily in expeditionary airlift services. Proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were $38.5 million and $40.3 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash provided from investing activities discontinued operations was $30.2 million in fiscal 2016 which included $28.3 of proceeds from contingent consideration related to our fiscal 2015 sale of Telair Cargo Group. In fiscal 2015, we received proceeds of $686.1 million after fees and expenses from the sale of Telair Cargo Group. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities continuing operations was $38.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $677.5 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease of $639.1 million was primarily attributable to the use of our proceeds from our sale of the Telair Cargo Group in fiscal 2015 to reduce our long term borrowings by $394.8 million, including the redemption of our $325 million 7.25% Senior Notes for $370.6 million. Proceeds from the sale of the Telair Cargo Group were also used to repurchase common stock via a tender offer in fiscal 2015 and other open market purchases which used $151.5 million of cash including fees and expenses compared to treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2016 of only $18.8 million. Cash Flows Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided from operating activities continuing operations was $68.6 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $166.3 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease of $97.7 million was primarily attributable to lower net income as a result of a $100.9 million reduction in gross profit in our Expeditionary Services segment. In addition, inventory and accounts receivable increased $35.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, in our supply chain business driven by sales growth in fiscal 2015 of 16.8% over the prior fiscal year. The sales growth was principally due to the continued ramp up of programs announced in the second half of fiscal 2014. These increased uses of cash were partially offset by less investment during fiscal 2015 in equipment on or available for long term lease as fiscal 2014 included an acquisition of equipment to support new supply chain programs. 27 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities continuing operations was $7.2 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a use of cash of $19.9 million in fiscal 2014. The increase of $27.1 million over the comparable prior period was primarily attributable to proceeds of $40.3 million received in fiscal 2015 from sale leaseback transactions for two aircraft from our expeditionary airlift business partially offset by higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2015. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities continuing operations was $677.5 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $85.9 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease of $591.6 million was primarily attributable to the use of our proceeds from our sale of the Telair Cargo Group to reduce our long term borrowings by $394.8 million, including the redemption of our $325 million 7.25% Senior Notes for $370.6 million. We also reduced the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility by $80 million during fiscal 2015. Proceeds from the sale of the Telair Cargo Group were also used to repurchase common stock via a tender offer and other open market purchases which used $151.5 million of cash including fees and expenses. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements A summary of contractual cash obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of May 31, 2016 is as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Due in Fiscal 2017 Due in Fiscal 2018 Due in Fiscal 2019 Due in Fiscal 2020 Due in Fiscal 2021 After Fiscal 2021 On Balance Sheet: Debt $ 25.0 $ $ $ 25.0 $ $ $ Bank borrowings 120.0 10.0 110.0 Capital leases 5.1 1.8 1.9 1.2 0.2 Interest1 7.3 2.2 2.1 1.7 1.3 Off Balance Sheet: Facilities and equipment operating leases 148.5 26.0 21.2 17.3 15.4 14.8 53.8 Purchase obligations2 227.5 186.0 31.3 6.6 0.4 2.7 0.5 Pension contribution 7.3 7.3 Notes: 1Interest associated with variable rate debt was determined using the interest rate in effect on May 31, 2016. 2Purchase obligations arise in the ordinary course of business and represent a binding commitment to acquire inventory, including raw materials, parts, and components, as well as equipment to support the operations of our business. We routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business. These instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements. The total of these instruments outstanding at May 31, 2016 was $12.3 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated 28 Table of Contents Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and certain rotables, revenue recognition, and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We review and evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for potential impairment at a minimum annually, on May 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. The accounting standards for goodwill allow for either a qualitative or quantitative approach for the annual impairment test. Under the qualitative approach, factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity relevant events or circumstances are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For the quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would be required to complete a second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting units fair value to its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. As of May 31, 2016, we have five reporting units as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other with only four of the reporting units assigned goodwill. Our four reporting units with goodwill include two in our Aviation Services segment (Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) and two in our Expeditionary Services segment (Airlift and Mobility). We utilized the qualitative assessment approach for the two Aviation Services reporting units with the two Expeditionary Services reporting units tested using the quantitative two step testing process. We estimate the fair value of the Expeditionary Services reporting units using an income approach based on discounted cash flows. The assumptions we used to estimate the fair value of these reporting units are based on historical performance as well as forecasts derived from our current business plan. The discounted cash flow valuation approach is highly dependent on certain components of our business plan including estimates of future sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, changes in working capital, and capital expenditures. All of these factors are affected by economic conditions related to the aerospace and defense industries as well as conditions in the global capital markets. In addition to the business plan specific assumptions, the expected long term cash flow growth rates and weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") are significant assumptions in the valuations. The WACC for each reporting unit was comprised of a weighted blend of an estimated rate of return on equity (based on publicly traded companies with business and economic risk characteristics comparable to each of our reporting units, i.e., "Market Participants"), risk free rate of return based on long term U.S. Treasury Bond rates, an equity risk premium, and an after tax rate of return on Market Participants debt. There were no significant changes to the underlying methods used in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year reporting unit valuations. We performed the annual test of goodwill for the two Aviation Services reporting units by performing a qualitative assessment and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values, and thus no impairment charge was recorded. Step one of the quantitative 29 Table of Contents goodwill impairment test was completed for the two Expeditionary Services reporting units and the estimated fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the Airlift and Mobility discounted cash flow valuations by assessing the impact of changes in certain assumptions on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by increasing the WACC or reducing the expected long term cash flow growth rates. We also perform sensitivity analysis on our business plan assumptions including sales and profitability. These reporting units would have had fair values in excess of their carrying values under all our sensitivity scenarios. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (estimated net realizable value). Cost is determined by the specific identification, average cost or first in, first out methods. Write downs are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions. We have utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories, such as inventory quantities and aging, historical sales of inventory, current and expected future aviation usage trends, replacement values, expected future demand, and historical scrap recovery rates. Reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories, could result in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods. Due to the remote geographic locations where we operate our expeditionary airlift business and the nature of our fixed and rotary wing aircraft, carrying large quantities of aircraft support parts is necessary in order to ensure availability of parts for servicing our fleet of aircraft. We record an excess and obsolete reserve for parts when our quantity on hand exceeds our forecasted needs or when the parts have been deemed obsolete or beyond economical repair. In addition, changes in the utilization of our fleet can affect estimates associated with our provision for excess and obsolete parts. Revenue Recognition Certain supply chain management programs that we provide to our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables, such as program and warehouse management, parts distribution and maintenance and repair services. We recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the time of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the products and services. Sales and related cost of sales for certain large airframe maintenance contracts and performance based logistics programs are recognized using contract accounting under the percentage of completion method in accordance with ASC 605 35, Construction Type and Production Type Contracts. In applying the percentage of completion method, we use the cost to cost method based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred. In connection with these contracts and programs, we are required to make certain judgments and estimates, including estimated revenues and costs, as well as inflation and the overall profitability of the program and the relative fair value of each element of the arrangement. Key assumptions involved in our contract accounting include future labor costs and efficiencies, overhead costs, and ultimate timing of product delivery. Differences may occur between the judgments and estimates made by management and actual program results. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We are required to test for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash 30 Table of Contents flows. When applying accounting standards addressing impairment to long lived assets, we have utilized certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash flows, including current and future sales volumes or lease rates, expected changes to cost structures, lease terms, residual values, market conditions, and trends impacting future demand. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of long lived assets. We maintain a significant inventory of rotable parts and equipment to service customer aircraft and components. Portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components, and are reworked to a useable condition. We may have to recognize an impairment of our rotable parts and equipment if we discontinue using or servicing certain aircraft models or if an older aircraft model is phased out in the industry. Pension Plans The liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension plans are determined utilizing several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. AAR uses discount rates to measure our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for our pension plans. We used a broad population of Aa rated corporate bonds as of May 31, 2016 to determine the discount rate assumption. All bonds were denominated in U.S. Dollars, with a minimum outstanding of $50.0 million. This population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 Moodys Aa rated, non callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and the bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds we would most likely select if we were to actually annuitize our pension plan liabilities. This portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the domestic plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. We establish the long term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns, both company specific and relating to the broad market, as well as analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations. The current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both our actual and target asset allocation. In calculating the net pension cost, the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value on plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non financial assets. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry specific guidance. This ASU will also supersede certain cost guidance included in Subtopic 605 35, Revenue Recognition Construction Type and Production Type Contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year which will make the new standard effective for us beginning June 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 02, Leases. This ASU amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets, including those classified as operating leases under the current accounting guidance. In addition, this ASU 31 Table of Contents will require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the Companys leasing activities. This new standard will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. This ASU requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations. The Company adopted this guidance on June 1, 2015 which resulted in expanded disclosures related to the income statement and cash flow activities of our discontinued operations. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge. We have elected to early adopt this new ASU retrospectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million from Other in noncurrent assets to Long term debt, less current maturities as of May 31, 2015. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU amends existing guidance to require the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position. We have elected to early adopt this new ASU retrospectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in the reclassification of deferred tax assets of $58.3 million from current assets to noncurrent liabilities as of May 31, 2015. 32 Table of Contents  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Dollars in millions) Our exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates, and credit losses on accounts receivable. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure. We are exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. A 10 percent increase in the average interest rate affecting our financial instruments, including the average outstanding balance of our debt obligations and related derivatives, would not have had a significant impact on our pre tax income during fiscal 2016. Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year, and balance sheet accounts are translated at year end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. A hypothetical 10 percent devaluation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would not have had a material impact on our financial position or continuing operations during fiscal 2016. 33  Table of Contents
