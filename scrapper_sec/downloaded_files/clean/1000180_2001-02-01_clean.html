of the additional purchase obligations so -8- presented. if any fraction of an ordinary share would, except for the provisions of this section, be issuable on the exercise of any additional purchase obligation (or specified portion thereof), t shall pay an amount in cash calculated by it to equal to the then current market value per share multiplied by such fraction computed to nearest whole

-11- deemed to have been not satisfied only if the failure to raise such funds causes a material change in the timetable or cost of the fab 2 project in relation to the business plan as determined by

exchange on which the ordinary shares are otherwise traded (a "demand"); provided, however, the initiation of such a demand may not be made by a holder that holds under 1,500,000 ordinary shares. in addition, at any time during the demand period, members of the purchaser group holding a majority of the purchaser group registrable securities may jointly initiate an additional demand. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, pursuant to section 5.3 of the additional purchase obligation agreement, a member of the purchaser group that holds at least 800,000 ordinary shares does not exercise any of its additional purchase obligations, the right of such member of the purchaser group to initiate a demand shall be accelerated to the tenth day after the date upon which the event giving rise to the right of such member of the purchaser group not to exercise the additional purchase obligation occurs. upon receipt of a demand of a member or members of the purchaser group, the company will promptly give written notice of such demand to tic and to all other members of the purchaser group and the company shall effect the registration of all registrable securities for which registration has been requested including registrable securities which the company has been requested to register by tic or members of the purchaser group by written request given to the company within 30 days after the giving of such written notice by the company. the company shall use its best efforts to have a demand become effective by the 60th day after a member of the purchaser group

upon receipt of a demand of tic, the company will promptly give written notice of such demand to all members of the purchaser group and the company shall effect the registration of all registrable

demand by a member or members of the purchaser group in which the registration of registrable securities is underwritten and the managing underwriter of the offering advises the members of the purchaser group and tic in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then there shall be excluded from such registration and underwriting to the extent necessary to satisfy such limitation, first shares which the company may wish to register for its own account or for the account of other shareholders of the company, and then shares held by

purchaser group and/or tic, as the case may be, as detailed above, the managing underwriter advises the company that due to marketing factors the shares requested to be registered for trading could not be sold, and accordingly the company does not effect a registration statement, then such request by the members of the purchaser group and/or tic, as the case may be, shall not be considered a demand under this section 2. 2.3 any registration proceeding begun pursuant to section 2.1 that is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the members of the purchaser group that initiated such registration proceeding and/or tic, as the case may be, shall count toward the quota of registration statements which the members of the purchaser group and/or tic, as the case may be, have the right to demand pursuant to section 2.1; provided, however, that such withdrawn registration shall not be so counted as a demand if such withdrawal is based upon (a) material adverse information relating to the company or its condition, business or prospects which is different from that generally known to the member(s) of the purchaser group that were to participate in such registration proceeding, in the event of a demand by a member or members of the purchaser group and/or tic, in the event of a demand by tic, as the case may be, at the time of its request or (b) general securities market conditions which are different from that generally known to the member(s) of the purchaser group that were to participate in such registration proceeding, in the event of a demand by a member or members of the purchaser group and/or tic, in the event of a demand by tic, as the case may be, at the time of its request, provided, in connection with this clause (b), that the member(s) of the purchaser group that were to participate in such registration proceeding, in the event of a demand by a member or members of the purchaser group and/or tic, in the event of a demand by tic, as the case may be, reimburse the company for its expenses incurred in connection with effecting such withdrawn registration. -5- 2.4 the company may not cause any other registration of securities for sale for its own account (other than a registration of securities to be offered to employees, directors or consultants pursuant to a benefit plan on form s-8 or a registration in connection with a merger, an exchange offer or any acquisition) to be initiated after a registration requested pursuant to section 2.1 and to become effective less than 180 days after the effective date of the registration requested pursuant to section 2.1. 2.5 notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 2, in the event that at any time during the demand period the company shall receive from a holder, or a group of holders, a written request that the company effect a registration on form f-3 (or any equivalent or successor form) with respect to registrable securities (the "f-3") where the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of such registrable securities equals at least three million united states dollars (us$3,000,000), the company will within twenty (20) days after receipt of any such request, file such registration and all such qualifications and compliance as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of the registrable securities as are specified in such request, and use its best efforts to have such registration on form f-3 effective by the 60th day after the holder, or group of holders, make such request and keep such registration on form f-3 effective until the distribution is complete, if underwritten, or, otherwise, for 270 days; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to file any such registration, qualification or compliance, pursuant to this section 2.5 if the company has, within the 180 day period preceding the date of such request, already effected one (1) registration for a requesting holder pursuant to this section 2.5. the company undertakes that it will use its best efforts to continue to comply with all necessary filings and other requirements so as to maintain its qualification to use form f-3. 2.6 the company shall not be required to effect more than three (3) registrations initiated by tic under section 2.1. the company shall not be required to effect more

therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, in which event the holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of its registrable securities pursuant to such prospectus until it is advised in writing by the company that the use of such prospectus may be resumed or until such holder receives copies of any supplement or amendment to such prospectus. 4.7 cause all

federal or state law or the securities laws of the state of israel, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) the omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (iii) any violation by the company of the securities act, the securities exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the securities exchange act or any state securities law, or any of the securities laws of the state of israel or any rule or regulation thereunder; and the company will reimburse each such holder, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 7, shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable to a holder, underwriter or controlling person in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company expressly for use in connection with such registration by a holder, underwriter or controlling person. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of a holder, the underwriter or any controlling person of a holder or the underwriter, and regardless of any sale in connection with such offering by a holder. 7.2 to the extent permitted by law, each holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter (within the meaning of the securities act) for the company, any person who controls such underwriter, and any other parties selling securities in such registration statement or any directors or officers or any persons controlling such parties, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, or underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act, the securities exchange act or other united states federal or state law, or any of the securities laws of the state of israel, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or actions in respect hereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent -9- (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration statement; and such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or controlling person, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action attributable to such violation or alleged violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. in no event shall the liability of a holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 7.3 promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7.3 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to notify an indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnifying party under this section 7, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 7. -10- 8. contribution if for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the registration or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that in no event shall any amount paid or due by a holder pursuant to sections 7 and 8 hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 9. designation of underwriter 9.1 in the case of any registration effected pursuant to section 2.1, should the offering be underwritten, the company and the relevant member of the purchaser group and/or tic, as the case may be, shall confer as to the selection of a managing underwriter. should they fail to reach agreement, the selection shall be made by the relevant member of the purchaser group and/or tic, as

compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, and of the securities act and the securities exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other

of at least 300,000 ordinary shares by a holder to a person or an entity and that the assignment relates only to those shares transferred to such person or entity, and further provided that such assignee agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement. 12. amendments, waivers, etc. this agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified or terminated except by an instrument in

upon which the proposal is to be made. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any selling shareholder proposes to pledge shares to a banking institution, such pledge shall be permitted only if such selling shareholder effects the pledge subject to the provisions of section 4 hereof, furnishes to the other parties hereto a written representation of the selling shareholder confirming that, and evidence which is reasonably satisfactory to indicate that, such pledge is subject to section 4 and ensures that no voting rights with respect to the shares are granted to the banking institution. 4.2 major holders' option. each major holder shall have an option for --------------------- a period of thirty (30) days from its receipt of the transfer notice to elect to purchase its respective pro rata share of the offered shares, and in the event that any other major holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of such offered shares not purchased by the other major holders (the "excess offered shares"), at the same price and subject to the same terms and conditions as described in the transfer notice. each major holder may exercise such purchase option and, thereby, purchase all or any portion of its pro rata share of the offered shares, and in the event that any major holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of the excess offered shares, by notifying the selling shareholder and the company in writing, before expiration of the thirty (30) day period as to the number of offered shares and excess offered shares, if any, which it wishes to purchase (the "purchase notice"). failure to respond to the transfer notice (a) within the applicable period will be considered a waiver of the right to exercise the right set forth in this section 4.2; and (b) within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the transfer notice will be considered a waiver of the right of co-sale set forth in section 6.1 provided that the transfer notice clearly references such right of co-sale. each major holder's pro rata share of the offered shares, or of the excess offered shares, as the case may be, shall be a fraction of the offered shares, or of the excess offered shares, as the case may be, of which the number of shares owned by such major holder on the date of the transfer notice shall be the numerator and the total number of shares held by all such major holders (excluding the selling shareholder) on the date of the transfer notice shall be the denominator. 4.3 if major holder(s) give the selling shareholder(s) purchase notice(s) pursuant to section 4.2 above with respect to all and not part of the offered shares, then such major holder(s) shall purchase their respective pro rata share of the offered shares, on the terms aforementioned and then payment for the offered shares shall be by check or wire transfer to a bank account to be designated by the selling shareholder, against delivery of the offered shares to be purchased at a place agreed upon between the parties and at the time of the scheduled closing therefor, which shall be no later than forty five (45) days after the selling shareholders' receipt of the purchase notice. 4.4 if the major holder(s) do not give the selling shareholder(s) purchase notice(s) pursuant to section 4.2 above with respect to all of the offered shares, then the major holder(s) shall not be entitled to purchase the offered shares, and the selling shareholder, at the expiration of the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, shall be entitled to transfer all (but not less than all) of the offered shares, provided, however, that in no event shall the selling shareholder transfer any of the offered shares to any transferee on terms more favorable to such transferee(s) than those stated in the transfer notice, and provided further than any of the offered shares not transferred within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period shall again be subject to the provisions of this section 4. 4.5 each major holder shall be entitled to apportion offered shares to be purchased among its permitted transferees, provided that such purchaser notifies the selling shareholder of such allocation. 5. right of first refusal. ---------------------- 5.1 transfer notice. subject to the provisions of section 3, if at any time, any shareholder proposes to transfer equity securities to one or more of the parties set forth in annex a hereto or any of their affiliatespursuant to a proposed understanding with such third parties (a "limited proposal"), then such shareholder (a "limited shareholder") shall give the company and each of the major holders, a written notice (the "limited transfer notice"), with limited transfer notice shall include (i) a description of the equity securities to be transferred ("offered limited shares"), (ii) the identity of the prospective transferees(s) and (iii) the consideration and the material terms and conditions upon which the limited proposal is to be made. the limited transfer notice shall certify that the limited shareholder has received a firm offer from prospective transferee(s) and in good faith believes a binding agreement for the transfer is obtainable on the terms set forth in the limited transfer notice. the limited transfer notice shall also include a copy of any written proposal, term sheet or letter of intent or other agreement related to the proposed sale. notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in the event that a shareholder is wholly merged with or is wholly acquired by any company headquartered in taiwan, roc or any affiliate of such company headquartered in taiwan, roc, the provisions of this section 5 shall not apply and/or (b) in the event that any limited shareholder proposes to pledge shares to a banking institution, such pledge shall be permitted only if such selling shareholder effects the pledge subject to the provisions of sections 4, 5 and 6 hereof, furnishes to the other parties hereto a written representation of the selling shareholder confirming that, and evidence which is reasonably satisfactory to indicate that, such pledge is subject to sections 4, 5 and 6 and ensures that no voting rights with respect to the shares are granted to the banking institution. 5.2 major holders' option. each major holder shall have an option for a period of thirty (30) days from its receipt of the limited transfer notice to elect to purchase its respective pro rata share of the offered limited shares, and in the event that any other major holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of such offered limited shares, and in the event that any other major holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of such offered limited shares not purchased by the other major holders (the "excess limited offered shares"), at the same price and subject to the same terms and conditions as described in the limited transfer notice. each major holder may exercise such purchase option and thereby, purchase all or any portion of its pro rata share of the offered limited shares, and in the event that any major holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of the excess limited offered shares, by notifying the limited shareholder and the company in writing, before expiration of the thirty (30) day period as to the number of offered shares and excess limited offered shares, if any, which it wishes to purchase (the "limited purchase notice"). failure to respond to the limited transfer notice within (a) the applicable period will be considered a waiver of the right to exercise the right set forth in this section 5.2, and (b) within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the limited transfer notice will be considered a waiver of the right of co-sale set forth in section 6.1, provided that the limited transfer notice clearly references such right of co-sale. each major holder's pro rata share of the offered limited shares, or of the excess limited offered shares, as the case may be, shall be a fraction of the offered limited shares, or of the excess limited offered shares, as the case may be, of which the number of shares owned by such major holder on the date of the transfer limited notice shall be the numerator and the total number of shares held by all such major holders (excluding the selling shareholder) on the date of the limited transfer notice shall be the denominator. 5.3 if major holder(s) give the limited shareholder(s) limited purchase notice(s) pursuant to section 5.2 above with respect to all and not part of the offered limited shares, then the limited shareholder shall not effect the sale of shares to the third party transferee rather to the major holder(s) exercising their right of first refusal and then payment for the offered limited shares shall be by check or wire transfer to a bank account to be designated by the limited shareholder, against delivery of the offered limited shares to be purchased at a place agreed upon between the parties and at the time of the scheduled closing therefor, which shall be no later than forty- five (45) days after the limited shareholders' receipt of the limited purchase notice. 5.4 if the major holder(s) do not give the limited shareholder(s) limited transfer notice(s) pursuant to section 5.2 above with respect to all of the offered limited shares, then the major holder(s) shall not be entitled to purchase the offered limited shares, and the limited shareholder, at the expiration of the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, shall be entitled to transfer all (but not less than all) of the offered limited shares, provided, however, that in no event shall the limited shareholder transfer any of the offered limited shares to any transferee on terms more favorable to such transferee(s) than those stated in the transfer notice, and provided further than any of the offered shares not transferred within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period shall again be subject to the provisions of this section 5.4. 5.5 each major holder shall be entitled to apportion offered limited shares to be purchased among its permitted transferees, provided that such purchaser notifies the limited shareholder of such allocation. 6. right of co-sale. 6.1 to the extent the major holders do not exercise their right of first refusal in respect of all of the offered shares pursuant to section 4 above or their right of first refusal in respect of all of the limited offered shares pursuant to section 5 above (for purposes of this section 6, offered shares or offered limited shares shall be referred to as "offered shares"), then each major holder (a "co-sale holder" for purposes of this section 6) shall be entitled to notify the selling shareholder or the limited shareholder, as the case may be (for purposes of this section 6, a selling shareholder or a limited shareholder shall be referred to as a "selling shareholder") in writing and shall have the right to participate in the disposition pursuant to section 4 above or the limited proposal pursuant to section 5 above on the same terms and conditions as specified in the transfer notice or the limited transfer notice, as the case may be (for purposes of this section 6, a transfer notice or a limited transfer notice shall be referred to as a "transfer notice"), subject to the provisions of this section 6. such selling co-sale holder's notice to the selling shareholder shall indicate the number of shares of equity securities the co-sale holder wishes to sell under its right to participate. 6.2 the respective co-sale rights of the selling shareholder and each co- sale holder shall be as follows: (a) the selling shareholder may sell all or any part of that number of offered shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of offered shares by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is 200% of the number of shares owned by such selling shareholder on the date of the transfer notice and the denominator of which is the total number of shares owned by all of the co-sale holders (excluding the selling shareholder) and 200% of the number of shares owned by the selling shareholder and (b) each co-sale holder (excluding the selling shareholder) may sell all or any part of that number of offered shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of offered shares by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares owned by such co-sale holder on the date of the transfer notice and the denominator of which is the total number of shares owned by all of the co-sale holders (excluding the selling shareholder) and 200% of the number of shares owned by the selling shareholder on the date of the transfer notice (the "co-sale shares"). the number of co-sale shares to be sold shall be rounded to the nearest whole share, with one-half share or more being rounded up. 6.3 each co-sale holder shall effect its participation in the sale by promptly delivering to the selling shareholder for transfer to the prospective purchaser one or more transfer deeds, properly executed for transfer, which represent the number of offered shares which such co-sale holder elects to sell. the transfer deeds that the co-sale holder delivers to the selling shareholder as provided above shall be transferred to the prospective purchaser upon consummation of the sale of the offered shares pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the transfer notice, and the selling shareholder shall concurrently therewith remit to such co-sale holder that portion of the net sale proceeds to which such selling holder is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale. to the extent that any prospective purchaser or purchasers prohibits such assignment or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from a co- sale holder exercising its rights of co-sale hereunder, the selling shareholder shall not sell to such prospective purchaser or purchasers any offered shares unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the selling shareholder shall purchase such shares or other securities from such selling holder for the same consideration and on the same terms and conditions as the proposed transfer described in the transfer notice. 6.4 non-exercise of rights. to the extent that the major holders have not ---------------------- exercised in full their rights to purchase all the offered shares within the time periods specified in sections 4.2 and 5.2, as the case may be, the selling shareholder shall have a period of ninety (90) days from the expiration of the 45 day period set forth in sections 4.2 and 5.2, as the case may be (the "ninety day period") to sell the offered shares and the co-sale shares, if any, upon terms and conditions (including the purchase price) no more favorable than those specified in the transfer notice to the third-party transferee(s) identified in the transfer notice. the third-party transferee(s) shall, as a condition to such transfer, become a party to section 2 of this agreement and become subject to all the provisions included therein unless waived by major holders, holding in the aggregate 75% of the aggregate number of shares of the company held at such time by all major holders. in the event that the selling shareholder and the third-party transferee remain desirous of consummating the sale or disposition of the offered shares and the co-sale shares, if any, yet due to a delay resulting from failure to obtain third party approvals, the sale or disposition of the offered shares and the co-sale shares, if any, cannot be consummated within the ninety day period, the ninety day period shall be extended by a further period of up to ninety (90) days (the "second ninety period"). notwithstanding the aforesaid in the previous sentence, in the event that the selling shareholder does not consummate the sale or disposition of the offered shares and the co-sale shares, if any, within the ninety day period or the second ninety day period, as the case may be, the major holders' first offer rights and first refusal rights and the co-sale holders' co-sale rights shall continue to be applicable to any subsequent disposition of the offered shares by such selling shareholder until such right lapses in accordance with the terms of this agreement. 6.5 sale of shares under rule 144. notwithstanding the provisions of ----------------------------- sections 4, 5 and 6, in the event of a public sale effected after the expiration of the initial restricted period, the selling shareholder shall be permitted to effect the public sale subject to and in accordance with rule 144 (including, without limitation, the volume limitations included therein), and such public sale shall not be subject to the rights of first offer, first refusal and co-sale set forth in sections 4, 5 and 6. 6.6 limitations to rights of first offer, first refusal and co-sale. --------------------------------------------------------------- notwithstanding the provisions of sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this agreement, any shareholder may sell or otherwise assign, with or without consideration, equity securities to any permitted transferee, provided, however, that any permitted transferee shall, prior to receiving any such equity securities and as a condition to the effectiveness of any such sale or assignation, become a party to this agreement and undertake to return such equity securities to its transferor in the event that the permitted transferee ceases to be a permitted transferee in relation to its transferor. 7. term and termination -------------------- this agreement shall be in effect from the date hereof and until the earlier of (i) twelve (12) years
