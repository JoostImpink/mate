irrevocably grants to, and appoints, abbott and any abbott's nominee its proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution) during the term of the stockholder agreement to vote its shares of vysis common stock, or grant a consent or approval in respect of the shares, in connection with any meeting of the stockholders of vysis: (a) in favor of the merger and approval and adoption of the merger agreement and any action required in furtherance thereof, (b) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of vysis in the merger agreement, and (c) against any action or agreement which would delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the merger or the offer or cause a condition to the closing of the merger or the offer to not be capable of being satisfied;

(b) provide information with respect to vysis or any vysis' subsidiary to anyone, other than abbott, relating to a possible alternative acquisition by anyone, other than abbott; or (c) enter into any agreement with respect to any proposal for an alternative acquisition. notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the acceptance for payment of vysis common stock pursuant to the offer, atc may advise the board of directors of vysis of receipt by it (or any stockholder representative) of any unsolicited proposal for an alternative acquisition or any inquiry indicating that anyone is considering making or wishes to make a proposal for an alternative acquisition. it should be noted that the term "stockholder representative" does not include vysis, any vysis' subsidiary or any representative of vysis;
