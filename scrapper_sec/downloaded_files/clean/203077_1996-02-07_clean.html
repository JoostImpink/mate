or other consideration were paid or given for the beneficial ownership which is the subject of this schedule. on january 29, 1996, sjm and daig executed an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"). a copy of the merger agreement is attached to this schedule as exhibit 1 and incorporated by reference herein. under the terms of the merger agreement, daig would be merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of sjm and daig would continue as the surviving corporation (the "merger"). in connection with the merger agreement, sjm and two stockholders of daig executed a shareholder agreement pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed to vote 3,047,228 shares of daig common stock held of record or beneficially by such stockholders (the "shares") in favor of the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting of the stockholders of daig to be held pursuant to the merger agreement (the "daig meeting"). in addition, such stockholders have granted to sjm irrevocable proxies to vote the shares with respect to the merger agreement and the merger. a copy of the form of shareholder agreement executed by the stockholders is attached to this schedule as exhibit 2. a copy of the irrevocable proxy executed by the stockholders is attached to the shareholder agreement. pursuant to the shareholder agreement, the stockholders have also agreed not to sell, assign, otherwise

any of such shares if such proxy, agreement or arrangement would be inconsistent with the proxy given to sjm. the stockholders of daig which have executed the shareholder agreement and the number of shares of daig common stock of each stockholder which are subject to the shareholder agreement and the related proxies is set forth below: shares john j. fleischhacker 2,010,600 daniel j. starks 1,036,628 the shareholder agreement and the irrevocable proxies were entered into by stockholders of daig to induce sjm to enter into the merger agreement. pursuant to the merger agreement, sjm will issue .651733 of a share of its common stock, $0.01 par value ("sjm common stock"), in exchange for each share of daig common stock outstanding upon the effectiveness of the merger. the shares of sjm common stock so issued will be newly issued shares. daig is presently authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of daig common stock, of which 15,236,144 shares were outstanding on january 29, 1996. in addition, sjm will make cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares of sjm common stock. sjm presently intends to finance all such cash payments with internally generated corporate funds. sjm does not currently intend to purchase any shares of daig common stock on the market or otherwise prior to the consummation of the merger. item 4. purpose of transaction. officers of sjm and daig signed the agreement and plan of merger on january 29, 1996. the merger agreement provides that each issued and outstanding share of daig common stock will be converted into, and exchanged for, .651733 of a share of sjm common stock, except that cash will be paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares. the transaction is intended to be tax free reorganization and to qualify for accounting purposes as a pooling-of-interests. the merger agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is subject to the approval of the stockholders of daig, regulatory approvals and various other closing conditions. it is anticipated that the merger will be consummated during the second quarter of calendar 1996. in connection with and in contemplation of the consummation of the proposed merger, two stockholders of daig executed a shareholder agreement and granted irrevocable proxies to sjm pursuant to which they have agreed to vote 3,047,228 shares of daig common stock in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, as described in item 3. because the transaction is to be treated for accounting purposes as a pooling-of-interests, sjm has entered into agreements with each of daig's officers and directors restricting, for a limited period both prior to and following the merger, the transfer of any shares of daig common stock and sjm common stock received by such person pursuant to the merger. agreements of this nature have been executed by john j. fleischhacker, daniel j. starks, john c. heinmiller, edward f. fox, dennis a. stowers and dale l. harris. a copy of the form of agreement executed by the six stockholders (the "affiliate agreement") is included as exhibit 3. following the effective date of the merger, john j. fleischhacker will continue as the chairman and chief executive officer of daig, and daniel j. starks will continue as the president and chief operating officer of daig. after consummation of the merger, daig common stock will cease to be designated for quotation on the nasdaq national market and will become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. sjm does not have any present plans or proposals relating to or which would result in: (a) the sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of daig or any of its subsidiaries; (b) any material change in the business of daig; or (c) any action similar to those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. pursuant to the shareholder agreement and the related irrevocable proxies, sjm has the right to vote 3,047,228 shares of daig common stock, or approximately 19.99% of the daig common stock outstanding, in favor of the merger agreement and the merger at the daig meeting. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this schedule, the filing of this schedule shall not be construed as an admission that sjm is the beneficial owner of such shares. except as described in item 4, sjm has not engaged in any transaction involving any securities issued by daig within the sixty-day period immediately preceding the date of this schedule. with the exception of the 3,047,228 shares of daig common stock which are subject to the shareholder agreement and related proxies, neither sjm nor any of the other persons named in item 2

of the outstanding common stock, $.01 par value, of partner ("partner common stock") will be converted into the right to receive common stock, $.10 par value, of company ("company common stock"); whereas, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the united states internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); and whereas, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the merger shall be accounted for as a "pooling of interests." the parties hereto agree as follows: article i the merger section 1.1 the merger. 1.1.1 subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, at the effective time (as defined in section 1.1.2), merger subsidiary shall be merged with and into partner (the "merger") in accordance with minnesota law, whereupon the separate existence of merger subsidiary shall cease, and partner shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") under the name of partner as set forth in section 1.1.3. 1.1.2 as soon as practicable after satisfaction of or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of, all conditions to the merger set forth in article viii, the parties hereto shall cause the merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "articles of merger") with the secretary of state of the state of minnesota, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, minnesota law and the parties hereto shall make all other filings or recordings required by minnesota law in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by this agreement. the merger shall become effective at such time as the articles of merger are duly filed with the secretary of state or such later date set forth in the articles of merger (the "effective time"). 1.1.3 at the effective time, (i) the separate existence of merger subsidiary shall cease and merger subsidiary shall be merged with and into partner, which shall be the surviving corporation; (ii) the officers of the surviving corporation shall initially be the officers of partner immediately prior to the merger; (iii) the directors of the surviving corporation shall initially be the directors of merger subsidiary immediately prior to the merger; (iv) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation shall initially be the same as the articles of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of merger subsidiary immediately prior to the merger, except that article i of the articles of incorporation of merger subsidiary shall, at the effective time, be amended to read that "the name of the corporation is daig corporation;" and (v) the merger shall, from and after the effective time, have all of the effects provided by applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the effective time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of merger subsidiary and partner shall vest in the surviving corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of merger subsidiary and partner shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation. section 1.2 conversion of merger subsidiary capital stock. at the effective time, each share of capital stock of merger subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be

so converted, which share shall be owned by company. section 1.3 cancellation or conversion of partner common stock. as of the effective time of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder: 1.3.1 any shares of partner common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time which are owned by company, merger subsidiary or partner

provided herein with respect to dissenting shares (as defined below in section 1.5); (ii) fractional shares; and (iii) shares of partner common stock canceled pursuant to section 1.3.1 hereof, at the effective time, each share of partner common stock outstanding shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of company common stock equal to .651733 (the "conversion ratio"), such shares of company common stock, together with the cash in respect of fractional shares to be received pursuant to section 1.3.3 (the "merger consideration"). 1.3.3 no fraction of a share of company common stock will be issued in the merger but, in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of partner common stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of company common stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of company common stock to be received by the holder) will be entitled to receive from the company an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the reference market value. for purposes of this agreement, "reference market value" of a share of company common stock shall mean the average of the closing sale prices (in thousandths) on the nasdaq national market system (the "nasdaq") of company common stock as reported in the wall street journal for the twenty trading days

exchange therefor the amount, without interest, of dividends and other distributions, if any, which have become payable with respect to the number of whole shares of company common stock into which the shares of partner common stock theretofore represented thereby shall have been converted and which have not previously been paid, together with any payment for fractional shares required by section 1.3.3 hereof. whether or not a partner stock certificate is surrendered, from and after the effective time such certificate shall under no circumstances evidence, represent or otherwise
