the shares purchased by each of legion partners i, legion partners ii and legion partners special iv were purchased with working capital (which may, at any given time, include margin loans made by brokerage firms in the ordinary course of business) in open market purchases, except as otherwise noted in schedule a, which is incorporated herein by reference. the aggregate purchase price of the 1,620,678 shares owned directly by legion partners i is approximately $12,224,372 including brokerage commissions. the aggregate purchase price of the 152,312 shares owned directly by legion partners ii is approximately $1,152,806 including brokerage commissions. the aggregate purchase price of the 346,343 shares owned directly by legion partners special iv is approximately $2,785,349, including brokerage commissions. &#160; item 4. purpose of transaction. &#160; the reporting persons purchased the shares based on the reporting persons&#8217; belief that the shares, when purchased, did not reflect their true intrinsic value and represented an attractive investment opportunity. depending upon overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the reporting persons, and the availability of shares at prices that would make the purchase or sale of shares desirable, the reporting persons may endeavor to increase or decrease their position in the issuer through, among other things, the purchase or sale of shares on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise, on such terms and at such times as the reporting persons may deem advisable. no reporting person has any present plan or proposal which would relate to or result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) - (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d except as set forth herein or such as would occur upon or in connection with completion of, or following, any of the actions discussed herein. the reporting persons intend to review their investment in the issuer on a continuing basis. the reporting persons believe that the current market price of the issuer&#8217;s shares does not reflect intrinsic value. one of the key areas that does not appear to be well understood or fully appreciated by the market is the opportunity for expansion of the issuer&#8217;s wi-fi offload revenues. during its most recent earnings release, the issuer noted that it had recently signed a second tier 1 carrier customer for wi-fi offload. based on a set of assumptions related to the growth in mobile data usage, we estimate that full penetration by the issuer of all four tier 1 carriers would equate to roughly $200mm potential annual revenues for the issuer from wi-fi offload only by 2020. based on our discussions with the issuer and our analysis, we believe that once these wi-fi offload revenues reach scale they could produce incremental adjusted ebitda margins of approximately 50%. given the current enterprise value under $350mm it would appear that the stock is far from fully reflecting the potential of wi-fi offload and its potential impact to revenues, earnings and cash flows. on june 1, 2016, each of ides capital management lp, ides capital opportunities fund, lp, ides capital advisors llc, ides capital partners lp, ides capital gp llc, dianne mckeever, robert longnecker (collectively, the &#8220;ides investors&#8221;), the reporting persons and the issuer entered into a cooperation agreement (the &#8220;cooperation agreement&#8221;). pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the issuer agreed to immediately (a) increase the size of its board of directors (the &#8220;board&#8221;) by two; (b) appoint maury austin as a class iii director with a term expiring at the issuer&#8217;s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#8220;2017 annual meeting&#8221;) and david cutrer as a class i director with a term expiring at the issuer&#8217;s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#8220;2018 annual meeting&#8221;); and (c) (x) cause the board, after giving effect to increasing the size of its membership by two as set forth above, to increase the size of its membership by one additional seat (for a total of nine seats) effective immediately following the adjournment of the issuer&#8217;s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#8220;2016 annual meeting&#8221;); and (y) appoint, with such appointment effective immediately following the adjournment of the 2016 annual meeting, kathy misunas as a class ii director with a term expiring at the issuer&#8217;s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#8220;2019 annual meeting&#8221;). at the 2017 annual meeting, the issuer further agreed to nominate and support the election of mr. austin. until the conclusion of the standstill period (defined below), the board agreed not to expand the size of the board to more than nine directors without the consent of a majority of the new directors. upon their appointments to the board, the issuer agreed to appoint mr. austin to the audit committee, mr. cutrer to the compensation committee and ms. misunas to the nominating and corporate governance committee. concurrent with the appointment of mr. cutrer to the board, the issuer also agreed to form a steering committee of the board and appoint mr. cutrer as a member of such committee. the reporting persons have agreed that mr. cutrer will immediately resign from the board if (i) any reporting person submits a notice of nomination of directors to the board during the standstill period, (ii) the reporting persons are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated any of their standstill obligations during the standstill period, or (ii) the reporting persons collectively cease to beneficially own at least 3.0% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the issuer. for so long as the reporting persons beneficially own at least 3.0% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the issuer, the reporting persons have the right to identify a replacement director in the event mr. cutrer is unable to serve as a director for any reason prior to the expiration of the standstill period. the ides investors has the same rights with respect to mr. austin. pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the reporting persons are subject to certain standstill restrictions during the period from the date of the cooperation agreement until the day that is thirty (30) days prior to the advance notice period for nominations of directors at the 2018 annual meeting (the &#8220;standstill period&#8221;). during the standstill period, the reporting persons are subject to customary standstill and voting obligations. at the 2016 annual meeting and 2017 annual meeting, the reporting persons have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the election of any person nominated by the board for election as a director and in accordance with the board&#8217;s recommendation on any other matters (other than an opposition matter (as defined in the cooperation agreement)) unless institutional shareholder services inc. (&#8220;iss&#8221;) or glass lewis & co., llc (&#8220;glass lewis&#8221;) differs from the board&#8217;s recommendations, then the reporting persons shall have the right to vote in accordance with the recommendation of iss or glass lewis. the reporting persons may vote their shares in their discretion with respect to any opposition matter. the foregoing description of the cooperation agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the cooperation agreement, which is incorporated by reference to the issuer&#8217;s form 8-k filed with the sec on june 1, 2016. &#160;
