(d) outstanding ffb series b preferred stock. if, immediately prior to the effective time, there shall be issued and outstanding any shares of ffb series b preferred stock, then each such share (excluding any treasury shares) of ffb series b preferred stock shall become and be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of func class a preferred stock ("new func series 1 preferred stock") having terms (to be set forth in the articles of amendment) substantially identical to those of the ffb series b preferred stock (but containing a mutually agreed upon provision limiting func's creation or issuance of shares of func preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares in the aggregate after the effective time for so long as any shares of new func series 1 preferred stock shall be outstanding).

(2) notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the exchange agent nor the depositary nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of ffb stock or ffb depositary shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (3) notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan, no dividends or other distributions with a record date following the 30th day to occur after the effective time shall be paid to any person holding old certificates representing ffb common stock until such old certificates have been surrendered for exchange for new certificates. subject to the effect of applicable laws, (i) until such 30th day, there shall be paid to each former holder of shares of ffb common stock, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but on or before such 30th day payable with respect to the shares of func common stock into which such ffb common stock has been converted pursuant to section 2.01 and (ii) following surrender of any such old certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of the new certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after such 30th day theretofore payable with respect to the shares represented thereby. 2.05. dissenting stockholders. (1) in accordance with section 14a:11-1(1)(a) of the njbca, except as set forth in section 2.05(2), no dissenters' rights of appraisal are available to any holder of shares of ffb stock, or to any holder of ffb depositary shares. to the extent necessary to avoid the existence of any such rights, ffb hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to continue the listing on the nyse or another national securities exchange of the shares of ffb stock (other than the ffb series f preferred stock), and the ffb depositary shares. (2) if any record holder of shares of ffb series f preferred stock shall be entitled to be paid the "fair value" of such shares ("dissenter's shares"), as provided in chapter 14a:11 of the njbca, ffb shall give func notice thereof and func shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. ffb shall not, except with the prior written consent of func, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. if any dissenting holder of ffb series f preferred stock shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost any right to dissent that such holder may have, the shares of ffb series f preferred stock held by such person shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of ffb series f preferred stock had been converted into shares of func series 3 preferred stock pursuant to section 2.01(f). 2.06. anti-dilution provisions. in the event func changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of func common stock issued and outstanding prior to the effective date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding func common stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the effective date, the exchange ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. 2.07. treasury shares. each of the shares of ffb stock held as treasury shares immediately prior to the effective time, shall be canceled and retired at the effective time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 2.08. options. from and after the effective time, all employee and director stock options to purchase shares of ffb common stock (each, an "ffb stock option"), which are then outstanding and unexercised, shall be converted into and become options to purchase shares of func common stock, and func shall assume each such ffb stock option in accordance with the terms of the plan and agreement by which it is evidenced; provided, however, that from and after the effective time (i) each such ffb stock option assumed by func may be exercised solely to purchase shares of func common stock, (ii) the number of shares of func common stock purchasable upon exercise of such ffb stock option shall be equal to the number of shares of ffb common stock that were purchasable under such ffb stock option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by the exchange ratio and rounding down to the nearest whole share, with cash being paid for any fractional share interest that otherwise would be purchasable, and (iii) the per share exercise price under each such ffb stock option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of each such ffb stock option by the exchange ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent. the terms of each ffb stock option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to func common stock on or subsequent to the effective date. it is intended that the foregoing assumption shall be effected in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of section 424 of the code, as to any ffb stock option that is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in section 422 of the code). iii. actions pending merger from the date hereof until the effective time, except as expressly contemplated in this plan, (i) without the prior written consent of func (which consent shall not be unreasonably

unreasonably withheld or delayed) func will not, and (except with respect to section 3.07) will cause each of its subsidiaries not to: 3.01. ordinary course. conduct the business of it and its subsidiaries other than in the ordinary and usual course or, to the extent consistent therewith, fail to use reasonable efforts to preserve intact their business organizations and assets and maintain

necessary approvals of any regulatory authorities (as defined in section 4.03(i)) required for the transactions contemplated hereby without the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type

(a) a large shareholder may make a written request for registration under the securities act of all or part of its registrable securities (a "demand registration"); provided that func shall not be obligated (i) to effect more than one demand registration in any 12-month period, (ii) to effect a demand registration for less than two million shares of func common stock or (iii) to effect a demand registration within 6 months of large shareholder selling any registrable securities pursuant to a piggyback registration under section 2.2. such request will specify the number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be sold and will also specify the intended method of disposition thereof. a registration will not count as a demand registration until it has become effective. (b) if such large shareholder so elects, the offering of such registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering. such large shareholder shall select the book-running and other managing underwriters in connection with such offering and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with the offering. such book-running and other managing underwriters shall be reasonably satisfactory to func. 2.2. piggyback registration. if func proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of func common stock (i) for func's own account (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8) or relating solely to securities issued pursuant to any benefit plan (or any substitute form that may be adopted by the commission) or (ii) for the account of any of the holders of func common stock, then func shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the large shareholder as soon as practicable (but in no event less than 10 days before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer subject to the terms and conditions hereof, large shareholder the opportunity to register such registrable securities as such large shareholder may request on the same terms and conditions as func's or such holders' func common stock (a "piggyback registration"). 2.3 reduction of offering. notwithstanding anything contained herein, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of an offering described in section 2.1 or 2.2 shall advise func that (i) the size of the offering that large shareholder, func and any other persons intend to make or (ii) the kind of securities that large shareholder, func and such other persons intend to include in such offering are such that the success of the offering would be materially and adversely affected, then (a) if the size of the offering is the basis of such underwriter's advice, the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of such large shareholder shall be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters; provided that (x) in the case of a demand registration, the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of such large shareholder shall be reduced only after the amount of securities to be offered for the account of func and such other persons has been reduced to zero, and (y) in the case of a piggyback registration, if securities are being offered for the account of persons other than func, then the proportion by which the amount of such registrable securities intended to be offered for the account of such large shareholder is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which the amount of such securities intended to be offered for the account of such other persons is reduced; and (b) if the combination of securities to be offered is the basis of such underwriter's advice, (x) the registrable securities to be included in such offering shall be reduced as described in clause (a) above (subject to the proviso in clause (a)), or (y) in the case of a piggyback registration, if the actions described in sub-clause (x) of this clause (b) would, in the judgment of the managing underwriter, be insufficient to eliminate the adverse effect that inclusion of the registrable securities requested to be included would have on such offering, such registrable securities will be excluded from such offering. iii. registration procedures 3.1 filings; information. whenever a large shareholder requests that any registrable securities be registered pursuant to section 2.1 hereof, func will use its reasonable efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities as soon as reasonably practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) func will as soon as reasonably practicable prepare and file with the sec a registration statement on any form for which func then qualifies and which counsel for func shall deem appropriate and available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use reasonable efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become and remain effective for a period of not less than 90 days; provided that if func shall furnish to such large shareholder a certificate signed by its chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer or any executive vice president stating that in his or her good faith judgment it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to func or its shareholders for such a registration statement to be filed, or, in the case of an effective registration statement, for sales to be effected thereunder, func shall have a period of not more than 120 days within which to file such registration statement measured from the date of receipt of such request in accordance with section 2.1 or, in the case of an effective registration statement, func shall be entitled to require such large shareholder to refrain from selling registrable securities under such registration statement for a period of up to 120 days. if func furnishes a notice under this paragraph at a time when a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement is effective, func shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in this section 3.1(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice under this paragraph to the date when sales under the registration statement may recommence. (b) func will, if requested, prior to filing such registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to the large shareholder requesting registration and each managing underwriter, if any, copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to such large shareholder and each such underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as such large shareholder or such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities. (c) after the filing of the registration statement, func will promptly notify such large shareholder of any stop order issued or, to the knowledge of func, threatened to be issued by the sec and take all necessary actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. (d) func will use its reasonable efforts to qualify the registrable securities for offer and sale under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as such large shareholder reasonably (in light of such large shareholder's intended plan of distribution) requests; provided that func will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction or (iii) consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. (e) func shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify each large shareholder that has sold, or is selling, registrable securities hereunder, at any time when a prospectus relating to the sale of the registrable securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an underwriter or dealer, of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and as promptly as practicable make available to each such large shareholder and to the underwriters any such supplement or amendment. each large shareholder, by requesting a registration or selling registrable securities hereunder, shall be deemed to agree with func that, upon receipt of any notice from func of the happening of any event of the kind described in the preceding sentence, such large shareholder will forthwith discontinue the offer and sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until receipt of the copies of such supplemented or amended prospectus and, if so directed by func, such large shareholder will deliver to func all copies, other than permanent file copies then in large shareholder's possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. in the event func shall give such notice, func shall extend the period during which any registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.1(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when func shall make available such supplemented or amended prospectus. (f) func will enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form and satisfactory in form and substance to func in its reasonable judgment) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities. (g) func will furnish to each large shareholder that sells registrable securities hereunder and to each managing underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to such large shareholder and each underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to func and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from func's independent auditors pursuant to sas 72, each in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters delivered to such parties. (h) func will make generally available to its securityholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of 12 months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and the rules and regulations of the sec thereunder. (i) func will use reasonable efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by func are then listed. func may require each large shareholder that requests a registration or is selling registrable securities hereunder promptly to furnish in writing to func such information regarding such large shareholder, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as func may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration. 3.2 registration expenses. in connection with any demand registration or piggyback registration by or for a large shareholder, func shall pay the following expenses incurred in connection with such registration (the "registration expenses"): (i) all filing fees with the sec, (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the registrable securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the registrable securities, (v) fees and expenses of counsel and independent certified public accountants for func (including the expenses of any comfort letters pursuant to section 3.1(g) hereof) and (vi) the reasonable fees and expenses of any additional experts retained by func in connection with such registration. such large shareholder shall pay any underwriting fees, discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of registrable securities, and any out-of-pocket expenses of large shareholder, including such large shareholder's counsel's fees and expenses. func shall pay internal func expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties). iv. indemnification and contribution 4.1 indemnification by func. func agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each large shareholder, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls large shareholder within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if func shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to func by or on behalf of any large shareholder or underwriter for any large shareholder expressly for use therein; provided that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any large shareholder if a copy of the current prospectus was not provided to purchaser and such current prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability or for any sales occurring after func has informed such large shareholder under section 3.1(e) and prior to the delivery by func of any supplement or amendment to such prospectus. func also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of such large shareholder provided in this section 4.1. 4.2 indemnification by large shareholders. each large shareholder, by requesting any registration or making any sale of registrable securities hereunder, shall be deemed to agree to indemnify and hold harmless func, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls func within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from func to large shareholder, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of large shareholder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to such registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each such large shareholder also shall be deemed to agree to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of func provided in this section 4.2. 4.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. 4.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article iv is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respects of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by func, any large shareholder and the underwriters from the offering of the securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of func, such large shareholder and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by func, such large shareholder and the underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by each of func and such large shareholder and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities. the relative fault of func, a large shareholder and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by or on behalf of such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. func and each large shareholder shall be deemed to agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 4.4, no underwriters shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and large shareholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds of the offering (before deducting expenses) received by large shareholder exceeds the amount of any damages which large shareholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty or fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. v. miscellaneous 5.1 participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting arrangements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and these registration rights. 5.2 rule 144. func covenants that it will use reasonable efforts to file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and that it will take such further action as any large shareholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such large shareholder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any large shareholder, func will deliver to such large shareholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. ex-2 3 exhibit 2 agreement, dated june 19, 1995 (this "agreement"), among banco santander,
