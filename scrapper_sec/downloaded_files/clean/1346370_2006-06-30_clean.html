however, we believe that the company's ability to reestablish compliance has less to do with the fundamentals of its core business or any real improvement in its continuing operations and more to do with one-time, non-recurring events.(1) in the absence of these non-recurring events, net revenue for the quarter would have reflected a $2.258 million loss, rather than a profit of $.839 million. further, this reinstatement is based on a very narrow margin of compliance and we remain concerned that the company will again fail to meet the financial guidelines necessary to remain compliant with a number of nasdaq's listing requirements. - --------------- (1) "during the three and six month periods ended april 30, 2006, the company recorded a gain on settlement of liabilities consisting of $1.5 million related to negotiated reductions in royalties due for certain video and video game titles, $0.5 million gain on the sale of rights to certain video game titles, and a $1.1 million gain on the settlement of accounts payable for legal, marketing, and development expenses for less than the invoiced amount." majesco entertainment co., form 10-q, for period ending 4/30/2006 as of the company's most recent quarterly report on form 10-q, the company had stockholders' equity of only $3,665,000. we believe that it is imperative for the company's future financial health and business that it immediately obtain additional equity capital, and we are not aware of any financings or other developments that would result in an increase in the company's stockholders' equity or any other improvement to its financial position. further, we believe that the company is perilously close to once again having it shares delisted by nasdaq, considering that the company's stockholders' equity is only modestly in excess of nasdaq's minimum requirements. we are prepared to provide immediate assistance to the company to avert what we believe to be an impending liquidity crisis and the delisting of its equity securities from nasdaq by reiterating our previous offer to make an equity investment in the company of three million dollars ($3,000,000), at a price of $1.50 per share, upon the terms, and subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions, set forth below. there are no other conditions to our investment except as set forth below. we believe that these conditions are customary and will not unduly disrupt the company or divert the attention of its management team. 1. cash investment. the company shall issue and sell to trinad or its designees, and trinad or its designees shall purchase from the company, an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the company's common stock at a price of $1.50 per share, or an aggregate of three million dollars. we note that this represents a premium of $0.07, or nearly 5%, over yesterday's closing price of the company's common stock. in light of our long-term commitment to the company and all of its shareholders, we are not requesting that the company be required to register our shares under applicable federal securities laws. we refer to the purchase and sale of common stock as set forth above as the "investment." 2. board representation. upon the completion of the investment, the company and the company's board shall take all necessary and desirable action, as reasonably requested by trinad, to appoint three designees of trinad to the company's board of directors and to limit the size of the board to seven members. this would result in the board being comprised of six independent members and morris sutton. we recognize that this may be effected in a number of ways including, without limitation, through the resignation of certain existing board members or by increasing the size of the existing board and, in each case, filling vacancies with our nominees. we are prepared to propose as nominees individuals that we strongly believe will add value to the board's decision-making process and enhance the board's ability to maximize shareholder value. further, we believe that such representation on the board is entirely commensurate with our substantial equity ownership in the company. we have already provided you with extensive background information on our nominees. 3. board approval; compliance with applicable laws. the investment and the other actions contemplated hereby shall be approved in advance by the board of directors of majesco in a manner to render inapplicable any and all laws, regulations and agreements that would prevent, or impose material conditions upon the investment. further, majesco shall execute and deliver any further instruments or documents and take all such necessary action that may be reasonably requested by trinad to carry out the purpose of this letter. 4. miscellaneous. (a) attorneys' fees. in the event any of the parties hereto shall institute any action or proceeding against any other party or parties hereto relating to this letter, the unsuccessful party in such action or proceeding shall reimburse the successful party or parties for its reasonable expense incurred in connection herewith, including reasonable attorneys' fees. further, the company shall be required to reimburse trinad for all of its out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including for reasonable attorneys' fees. (b) governing law. this letter shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, united states of america, without regard to conflict of law principles. (c) entire letter; modification. this letter sets forth the entire understanding among the parties and supersedes all agreements made prior to or contemporaneously herewith, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. any modification of this letter must be in writing and signed by all of the parties hereto in an instrument which makes specific reference to this letter. (d) termination. in the event that this letter is not accepted in writing by majesco and returned to trinad before 5:00 p.m. est monday, july 3, 2006, this letter shall automatically terminate and be null and void without any obligation of trinad. further, this letter may be terminated earlier by trinad by the delivery of written notice to majesco of its desire to so terminate. (e) counterparts. this letter may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. (f) non-binding letter. your acceptance and execution of this letter will affirm our mutual intent as set forth herein. this letter expresses only the intention of trinad to make the investment contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, and does not constitute a binding agreement, or create any legal obligation on the part of trinad. any such agreement or legal obligation shall be created solely through the execution and delivery of a definitive purchase or investment agreement in form and substance mutually satisfactory to both parties. if such a definitive agreement is not executed, our respective obligations under this letter of intent shall be terminated. we are confident that our proposal is reasonable and beneficial to the interests of the company's shareholders. the board's failure to respond to our many overtures has resulted in the continued deterioration of the company. as you know, during the past several months we made several offers to the board to make a substantial equity investment in the company, including an offer not long ago to invest $7.5 million in the company through the purchase from the company of approximately 4,285,714 shares of the company's common stock at a price of $1.75 per share, which represented a premium of more than 20% over the closing price of the common stock on the date immediately preceding that offer. to the shock and dismay of us and our fellow company shareholders, the board did not even bother to respond to that offer. at the time, and clearly in retrospect, it is clear that the board's inaction amounted to a gross and blatant disregard of the interests of the company and its shareholders. the company responded to a subsequent offer to provide financing, by issuing to trinad a non-disclosure agreement that contained egregious and uncustomary stipulations for a document of this nature. such conditions were specifically intended to tie our hands and further entrench members of this board and management team who continue to go to great lengths to remain unaccountable to the company's shareholders. given the current condition of the company, and its continued deterioration, that offer has been withdrawn. although we have been purchasing shares of the company's common stock in the open market, we believe that it would be in the best interests of the company if it were to directly issue new shares to us and receive the proceeds for the sale of such shares, which it appears to desperately need. our offer contains minimal conditions, and we believe provides the board with an opportunity that--in the course of discharging its fiduciary duties to all of the company's stockholders--it is compelled to accept. the time has come for the board to take decisive and aggressive action to begin to deal with the enormity of problems that now face the company. we are confident that our proposal is very generous, particularly considering the company's continued poor performance and current and deteriorating financial position. time is clearly of the essence, as any further diminution in shareholder value is simply unacceptable. in the event that the board once again rejects our offer, then we are prepared to continue to purchase shares of the company's common stock and to seek to force the board to finally take action that is in the best interests of all of its stockholders. if you agree to accept our investment proposal upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, please so indicate by signing this letter in the space provided below for your signature, whereupon we will instruct our counsel to immediately begin drafting definitive agreements for our respective review. thank you for your prompt consideration of this very important matter. very truly yours, trinad capital master fund ltd. by: trinad capital l.p. by: trinad advisors gp llc by: /s/ robert s. ellin ------------------- name: robert s. ellin title: managing member agreed to and accepted this __ day of ___________, 2006: majesco entertainment company by: _____________________________ name: title: -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
