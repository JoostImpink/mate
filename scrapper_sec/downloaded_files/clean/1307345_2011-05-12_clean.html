in performance of the terms of the share exchange agreement, as amended on march 25, 2011, among other matters, the issuer: &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; effectuated a reverse stock split of the issuer&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares at a ratio of 1 for 2.4, which became effective on march 21, 2011, decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock by the same proportion from 100,000,000 to 41,666,667 shares of common stock, and decreased the number of authorized shares of preferred stock by the same proportion from 20,000,000 shares to 8,333,333 shares of preferred stock. as a result of the reverse stock split, every 2.4 shares of the company&#8217;s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time for the stock split was combined and reclassified into one share of common stock;

the foregoing description of the share exchange agreement, as amended, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the share exchange agreement, as amended, attached as exhibits 3 and 4 to this schedule 13d. &#160; because through itp-lux the natural reporting persons own and control approximately 94% of the issuer&#8217;s common stock, it may be more difficult or may impede that any other party acquires control of the issuer. &#160; none of issuer&#8217;s shares or other securities are presently listed for trading in any securities exchange. however, it is in issuer&#8217;s current plans to apply for such listing. prior to seeking the listing of issuer&#8217;s shares in any securities exchange, issuer will be required to satisfy various listing requirements, including the restructuring of issuer&#8217;s board of directors, the increase of the number of its directors and the formation of various committees, and compliance with other requirements. &#160; the reporting persons intend to continuously review their investment in the issuer, and may in the future determine (i) to acquire additional securities of the issuer, through open market purchases, private agreements or otherwise, (ii) to dispose of all or a portion of the securities of the issuer owned by them, (iii) to take any other available course of action, which could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described in clauses (a) through (i) of the item 4 of schedule 13d. &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; notwithstanding anything contained herein, the reporting persons specifically reserve the right to change their intention with respect to any or all of such matters. in reaching any decision as to their course of action (as well as the specifics elements thereof), the reporting persons expect that they will take into account a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the following: the issuer&#8217;s business and prospects; other developments concerning the issuer and its business generally; other business opportunities available to the reporting persons; developments with respect to the business of itp-lux; changes in law and governmental regulations; general economic conditions; and money and stock market conditions, including the price of the securities of the issuer. &#160; other than as provided herein, and except as contained in the agreements filed as exhibits to this schedule 13d or as has been publicly announced by the issuer or the reporting persons, the reporting persons do not have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions set forth in clause (a) through (j) of item 4 of the schedule 13d. &#160; item 5.&#160;&#160;interest in securities of the issuer. &#160; (a)-(b)&#160;&#160;as of the date of this schedule 13d, the issuer has 36,107,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.&#160;&#160;itp-lux owns 34,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer, representing approximately 94% of the issuer&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock. &#160; the natural reporting persons, through their joint ownership and control of all of the issued and outstanding shares of itp-lux, which are issued and held in bearer form, are deemed beneficial owners of the 34,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer which are the subject of this schedule 13d, and together with itp-lux, share the power to vote or to direct the vote, the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of these shares. &#160; together with itp-lux, each of the natural reporting persons, directly or through their representatives for such natural reporting persons who are minors, has the shared power to vote or to direct the vote, to dispose or to direct the disposition, of 100% of the 34,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer which are the subject of this schedule 13d. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;other than described in this schedule 13d, no transactions were made by the reporting persons in the class of reported securities during the last 60 days. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;other than the reporting persons, no person has the right to receive, or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the 34,000,000 shares of common stock owned by itp-lux. &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;it is inapplicable for the purposes hereof to state the date on which the reporting persons ceased to be the owner of more than five per cent of the common stock. &#160; item 6.&#160;&#160;contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. &#160; for a summary description of the share exchange agreement, see item 4 above. other than the share exchange agreement and other than as described in this schedule 13d with respect to the natural reporting person&#8217;s deemed beneficial ownership of the 34,000,000 through their joint ownership and control of all of the issued and outstanding shares of itp-lux, which are issued and held in bearer form, the reporting persons are not aware of any contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to the securities of the issuer required to be disclosed herein. &#160;
