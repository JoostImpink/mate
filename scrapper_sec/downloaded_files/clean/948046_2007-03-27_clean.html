purchase pursuant to its backstop commitment. in no event, however, may dbsi acquire more than 45% beneficial ownership, nor may spcp group acquire more than 30% beneficial ownership, of the company's issued and outstanding common stock. notwithstanding the foregoing imitations on beneficial ownership, spcp group's participation enables a full backstop of the rights offering. if no stockholders participate in the rights offering, dbsi is obligated to purchase all 55,384,615 shares of the company's common stock offered in the rights offering and spcp is obligated to purchase fifty percent (50%) of those shares from dbsi. in such case, dbsi would own 29,819,912 shares and spcp group would own 27,692,308 shares, representing approximately 31.4% and 29.2% ownership of the company's common stock, respectively, and reducing the ownership interest of the remaining stockholders to approximately 39.4%. the equity agreement also gives dbsi the option to make a direct investment (the "direct

acquire shares of the company's common stock that would result in it beneficially owning more than 15% of the company's total issued and outstanding common stock after consummation of the rights offering. pursuant to the equity agreement, dbsi's backstop commitment is subject to several conditions including, among others, the amendment of the company's amended and restated credit agreement,

fully described in the equity agreement. the company agreed to pay dbsi a backstop commitment fee equal to 3.00% of the maximum dollar value of the rights offering, of which $3.15 million has been paid and $2.25 million will be paid upon the closing of the rights offering. dbsi has agreed to pay fifty percent (50%) of this commitment fee to spcp group, pursuant to the paia. in the event of termination of the equity agreement pursuant to certain conditions more fully described therein, the company has agreed to pay to dbsi a termination fee equal to $1.8 million or $3.6 million, fifty

terminated upon the happening of certain events), be prohibited from (i) directly or indirectly acquiring common stock that would result in dbsi beneficially owning more than 45%, or spcp group owning more than 30%, of the company's issued and outstanding common stock, unless such transaction is approved by a committee of independent directors of the company's board of directors or (ii) taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, making acquisition proposals or calling special meetings. pursuant to such standstill agreements, dbsi and spcp group will, for 90 days following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the equity agreement, be entitled to designate certain individuals to fill up to three newly-established seats on the company's board of directors, depending upon and subject to obtaining certain minimum levels of percentage ownership of the company's common stock held by dbsi and spcp group, as applicable, immediately following the rights offering. the ability to designate such individuals will be subject to several conditions and limitations, which are more fully described in the standstill agreements. in addition, dbsi and spcp group have agreed that each will vote or cause to vote all shares that it beneficially owns in favor of the slate of directors nominated by the board of directors of the company at the company's annual meetings of stockholders to be held in 2007 and 2008, so long as the company is not in breach of its obligations under such standstill agreements. registration rights agreement in connection with the equity agreement, the company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement") with dbsi and spcp group, pursuant to which the company has agreed, among other things, to register with the sec for resale the shares of the company's common stock acquired by dbsi, spcp group, and any additional investors in the rights offering and pursuant to the direct investment option. dbsi and spcp group may each assign the rights, interests, and obligations under the registration rights agreement to one third party who acquires at least 10.0 million shares of
