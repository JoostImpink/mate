exercise price. the exercise price and the number of warrant shares issuable on exercise of each warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as described in this section 10. all calculations under this section 10 will be made to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. 10.1 antidilution adjustments. subject to section 10.3, the following adjustments shall be made: (a) common stock issued at less than market value. if the company issues or sells any common stock other than excluded stock (as defined in section 10.4) without consideration or for consideration per share less than the market price (as defined in section 10.4) (provided, however, that no sale of securities pursuant to a bona fide underwritten public offering will be deemed to be for less than market price), as of the day of such issuance or sale, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance or sale will immediately (except as provided below) be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price, in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (i) the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such issue, (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, (iii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding in-the-money options and conversion of outstanding in-the-money convertible securities prior to such issue and (iv) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company for the total number of such additional shares of common stock so issued or sold would purchase at the market price on the last trading day immediately preceding such issuance or sale and (y) the denominator of which shall be (i) the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such issue, (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately 4 prior to such issue, (iii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding in-the-money options and conversion of outstanding in-the-money convertible securities prior to such issue, and (iv) the number of shares of common stock so issued or sold. in such event, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (a) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (b) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. for the purposes of any adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of each warrant pursuant to this section 10.1(a), the following provisions shall be applicable: (1) in the case of the issuance of common stock for cash, the amount of the consideration received by the company shall be deemed to be the amount of the cash proceeds received by the company for such common stock before deducting therefrom any discounts or commissions allowed, paid or incurred by the company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. (2) in the case of the issuance of common stock (otherwise than upon the conversion of any shares of capital stock or other securities of the company) for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, including securities acquired in exchange therefor (other than securities by their terms so exchangeable), the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the board of directors, provided, however, that such fair value as determined by the board of directors shall not exceed the aggregate market price of the shares of common stock being issued as of the date the board of directors authorizes the issuance of such shares. (3) in the case of the issuance of (a) options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire common stock (whether or not at the time exercisable) or (b) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (whether or not at the time so convertible or exchangeable) or options, warrants or rights to purchase such convertible or exchangeable securities (whether or not at the time exercisable): (i) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise of such options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options, warrants or rights are issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in sections 10.1(a)(1) and (2)), if any, received by the company upon the issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options, warrants or rights for the common stock covered thereby; (ii) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire 5 such convertible or exchangeable securities and the subsequent conversion or exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the company for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration (determined in the manner provided in section 10.1(a)(1) and (2)), if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities, or upon the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire such convertible or exchangeable securities and the subsequent conversion or exchange thereof; (iii) on any change in the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities or any change in the consideration to be received by the company upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, but excluding changes resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof (to the extent comparable to the antidilution provisions contained herein), the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant as then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price and number of shares as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such options, warrants or rights not exercised prior to such change, or of such convertible or exchangeable securities not converted or exchanged prior to such change, upon the basis of such change; (iv) on the expiration or cancellation of any such options, warrants or rights (without exercise), or the termination of the right to convert or exchange such convertible or exchangeable securities (without exercise), if the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall have been adjusted upon the issuance thereof, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price and number of shares as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such options, warrants, rights or such convertible or exchangeable securities on the basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights, or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities; and (v) if the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall have been adjusted upon the issuance of any such options, warrants, rights or convertible or exchangeable securities, no further adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be made for the actual issuance of common stock upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof; provided, however, that no increase in the exercise price shall be made pursuant to subclauses (i) and (ii) of this section 10.1(a)(3). 6 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 10.1(a), no adjustment will be required in respect of issuances of common stock (or options to purchase common stock) pursuant to stock options granted prior to the date hereof. (b) certain repurchases of common stock. in case the company effects a pro rata repurchase (as defined in section 10.4) of common stock, then the exercise price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the effective date of such pro rata repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (x) the product of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such pro rata repurchase (after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding in-the-money convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding in-the-money options) and (b) the market price of a share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the company or any of its affiliates of the intent to effect such pro rata repurchase, minus (y) the aggregate purchase price of the pro rata repurchase, and of which the denominator shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such pro rata repurchase (after giving effect to the conversion of outstanding all in-the-money convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding in-the-money options) minus the number of shares of common stock so repurchased and (y) the market price per share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement of such pro rata repurchase. in such event, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (a) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (b) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the pro rata repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (c) business combinations. subject to section 12 hereof, in case of any change of control (as defined in section 10.4) or reclassification of common stock (other than a reclassification of common stock referred to in section 10.1(d)), the shares issued or issuable upon exercise of this warrant after the date of such change of control or reclassification will be exchangeable for the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the shares issuable (at the time of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance) upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such change of control or reclassification would have been entitled upon such change of control or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable on the exercise of this warrant. in determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon consummation of such change of control, if the holders of common stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such change of control, then the holder shall have the right to make a similar election upon exercise of this 7 warrant with respect to the number of shares of stock or other securities or property which the holder will receive upon exercise of this warrant. (d) stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations. if the company shall (1) declare a dividend or make a distribution on its common stock in shares of common stock, (2) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, or (3) combine or reclassify the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive after such date had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date. in such event the exercise price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (a) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment and (b) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. (e) other distributions. in case the company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its common stock (1) of shares of any class other than its common stock or (2) of evidence of indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary or (3) of assets, or (4) of warrants or similar rights (in each case excluding any dividends or distribution referred to in section 10.1(d)), in each such case the exercise price in effect on the record date will be reduced by an amount equal, in the case of a distribution in cash, to the amount thereof payable per share of the common stock, or in the case of any other distribution, to the fair value thereof per share of the common stock as determined by the board of directors. such reductions shall take effect on the record date for such distribution. in such event, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (a) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (b) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. in the event that such distribution is not so made, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants, as the case may be, to the exercise price that would then be in effect and the number of warrant shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this warrant if such record date and distribution had not been fixed. (f) no adjustment in the exercise price or the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant is required if the amount of the adjustment is less than $0.01 or one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be; provided, however, 8 that any adjustments which by reason of this section 10.1(f) are not required to be made will be carried forward and given effect in any subsequent adjustment. (g) for the purposes of this section 10.1, the term "shares of common stock" shall include (1) the class of stock designated as the common stock of the company at the date hereof or (2) any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such shares consisting solely of changes in par value, or from no par value to par value. (h) notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case which this section 10.1 provides that an adjustment becomes effective immediately after a record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event (1) issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised or converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional securities issuable upon such exercise or conversion after giving effect to such adjustment and (2) paying to the holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to section 4. (i) if the company takes any action affecting the common stock, other than action described in this section 10.1, which in the opinion of the board of directors of the company would materially adversely affect the conversion rights of the holder of the warrants, the exercise price for the warrants and/or the number of warrant shares received upon exercise of the warrant may be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in such manner, if any, and at such time, as such board may determine in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances. 10.2 voluntary adjustment by the company. the company may at its option, at any time during the term of the warrants, reduce the then current exercise price or increase the number of shares for which the warrant may be exercised to any amount deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the company; provided, however, that if the company elects to make such adjustment, such adjustment will remain in effect for at least a 15-day period, after which time the company may, at its option, reinstate the exercise price or number of shares in effect prior to such reduction, subject to any interim adjustments pursuant to section 10.1. 10.3 miscellaneous. except as provided in section 10.1, no adjustment in respect of any dividends or other payments or distributions made to holders of securities issuable upon exercise of warrants will be made during the term of a warrant or upon the exercise of a warrant. to the extent (but only to the extent) that the holder's rights hereunder have been protected by the holder's exercise (at holder's election and reasonable allocation) of its preemptive rights under any pre-emptive rights agreement or similar agreement between the company and the holder hereof, no adjustments will be made to the exercise price or the number of warrant shares. 10.4 definitions. for purposes hereof, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 9 "change of control" means (a) (i) the corporation's sale of all or substantially all of its business, assets or property (including intellectual property) or (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in a reorganization, merger, or consolidation (whether or not the corporation is the entity surviving such transaction) in which holders of all voting equity securities of the corporation immediately prior to such transaction will hold (by reason of their holdings in the corporation) less than 50% of the voting equity securities of the corporation or other entity surviving such transaction or (b) a transaction or series of related transactions in which a person or group (as defined in rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act")) (excluding warburg pincus private equity viii, l.p. and its affiliates) acquires beneficial ownership (as determined in accordance with rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) of more than 50% of the voting equity securities of the corporation.

(c) in any of such events, if the consideration received by the corporation is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value as determined by the board of directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment. any securities shall be valued as follows: (i) securities not subject to restrictions on free marketability: (1) if traded on a securities exchange or through nasdaq national market system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; (2) if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is applicable) over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and (3) if there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined (x) by agreement between the corporation and the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock or (y) in the absence of such agreement, by the board of directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment (after consultation with a mutually acceptable financial advisor in the event such fair market value is expected in good faith by a majority of the board of directors or a majority of the series a directors to exceed $1,000,000). (ii) the method of valuation of securities subject to restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder's status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in (i)(1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined (x) by agreement between the corporation and the holder of a majority of the -3- outstanding shares of series a preferred stock or (y) in the absence of such agreement, by the board of directors in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business judgment (after consultation with a mutually acceptable financial advisor in the event such fair market value is expected in good faith by a majority of the board of directors or a majority of the series a directors to exceed $1,000,000).
