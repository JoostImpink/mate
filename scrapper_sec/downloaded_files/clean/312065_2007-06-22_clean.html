(iv) upon the conversion of any shares of series aa preferred stock, no adjustment or payment shall be made with respect to such converted shares on account of any dividend thereafter on shares of such stock or on account of any dividend on the common stock, except that the holder of such converted shares shall be entitled to be paid any dividends declared on shares of common stock after conversion thereof. (v) if the corporation shall at any time be liquidated, dissolved or wound-up, the conversion privilege shall terminate at the close of business on the last business day next preceding the effective date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

&#147; warrant &#148;), from florida gaming corporation, a delaware corporation (the &#147; company &#148;) having its principal place of business at 1750 kings highway, fort pierce, florida 34945, an aggregate of twenty thousand (20,000) shares (the &#147; warrant shares &#148;) of the company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.20 per share (together with any common stock into which such common stock may be converted in connection with any merger or consolidation of the company, the &#147;common stock&#148;), at a price per share of $30.00 (the &#147; exercise price &#148;). capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the stockholders agreement, dated as of june 15, 2007 (as amended from time to time, the &#147; stockholders agreement &#148;), among the company, the initial holder and the other parties thereto. this warrant shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time from and after the date of execution of that certain stock subscription agreement between the holder (as defined in section 7 herein) and the company (such date being referred to herein as the &#147; initial exercise date &#148;) up to and including 5:00 p.m. (pacific time) on the five (5) year anniversary of the date hereof (such date being referred to herein as the &#147; expiration date &#148;), upon surrender to the company at its principal office (or at such other location as the company may advise the holder in writing) of this warrant properly endorsed with (i) the exercise form attached hereto duly completed and executed and (ii) payment pursuant to section 2 of the aggregate exercise price for the number of warrant shares for which this warrant is being exercised determined in accordance with the provisions hereof. the exercise price and the number of warrant shares purchasable hereunder are subject to further adjustment as provided in section 4 of this warrant. 1. exercise; issuance of certificates; acknowledgement . this warrant is exercisable at the option of the holder of record hereof, at any time or from time to time on or after the initial exercise date up to the expiration date, for all or any part of the warrant shares (but not for a fraction of a warrant share) which may be purchased hereunder. the company agrees that the shares of common stock purchased under this warrant shall be and are deemed to be issued to the holder hereof as the record owner of such shares as of the close of business on the date on which this warrant shall have been surrendered, properly endorsed, the completed, executed exercise form delivered and payment made for such shares. certificates for the shares of the common stock so purchased, together with any other securities or property to which the holder hereof is entitled upon such exercise, shall be delivered to the holder hereof by the company at the company&#146;s expense within a reasonable time after the rights represented by this warrant have been so exercised. each certificate so delivered shall be in such denominations of the warrant shares as may be requested by the holder hereof and shall be registered in the name of such holder. in case of a purchase of less than all the warrant shares, the company shall execute and deliver to holder within a reasonable time an acknowledgement in the form attached hereto indicating the number of warrant shares which remain subject to this warrant, if any. 2. payment for shares . the aggregate purchase price for warrant shares being purchased hereunder may be paid either (i) by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the company to the holder, or (ii) by surrender of a number of warrant shares which have a market value (as defined below) equal to the aggregate exercise price of the warrant shares being purchased (&#147; net issuance &#148;) as determined herein. if the holder elects the net issuance method of payment, the company shall issue to holder upon exercise a number of shares of warrant shares determined in accordance with the following formula: x = y (a-b) a where: x = the number of warrant shares to be issued to the holder; y = the number of warrant shares with respect to which the holder is exercising its purchase rights under this warrant; a = the market value of one (1) share of the warrant shares on the date of exercise; and b = the exercise price. no fractional shares arising out of the above formula for determining the number of shares to be issued to the holder shall be issued upon exercise of this warrant. in lieu thereof, the company shall make payment to the holder of cash in the amount of such fraction multiplied by the market value of one (1) share of the warrant shares on the date of exercise. for purposes of the above calculation (which shall be the date of exercise), the &#147; market value &#148; of one (1) share of the warrant shares shall mean, as of any date of determination, the price per share of common stock equal to the average of the last sales price of a share of common stock on each of the last five trading days prior to the date of determination (&#147; calculation period &#148;) on the principal securities exchange on which the common stock may at the time be traded or, if there shall have been no sales on such principal securities exchange during the calculation period, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such principal securities exchange on each day during the calculation period, on the next preceding five dates on which such bid and asked prices occurred or, if common stock shall not be so listed, the average of the closing sale prices as reported during the calculation period in the over-the-counter market. 3. shares to be fully paid; reservation of shares . the company covenants and agrees that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant will, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive rights of any shareholder and free and clear of all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof, except as otherwise provided by the stockholders agreement. the company further covenants and agrees that during the period within which the rights represented by this warrant may be exercised, the company will at all times have authorized and reserved, for the purpose of issue or transfer upon exercise of the rights evidenced by this warrant, a sufficient number of shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock, or other securities and property, when and as required to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant in full. 4. adjustment of exercise price and number of shares . the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant and the exercise price hereunder shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events, as follows: 4.1 dividends or distributions of common stock . if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution on the common stock payable in additional shares of common stock, then and in each such event the exercise price hereunder then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the exercise price hereunder then in effect by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock (assuming the conversion or exercise of all outstanding securities of the company that are convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock, including the exercise of all options and warrants to purchase common stock or securities that are convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of issuance or the close of business on such record date; and (b) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock (assuming the conversion or exercise of all outstanding securities of the company that are convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock, including the exercise of all options and warrants to purchase common stock or securities that are convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock) issued and outstanding immediately after the time of issuance or the close of business on such record date. 4.2 dividends or distributions of other securities . if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution on the common stock payable in securities of the company other than common stock and other than as otherwise adjusted in this section 4, then and in each such event the holder shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this warrant, in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the kind and amount of such other securities receivable upon such dividend or distribution, to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock (or any shares of stock or other securities which may be) issuable upon the exercise of this warrant would have received if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. 4.3 stock splits or combinations . if the company shall at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock, or if the company shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of common stock then the exercise price hereunder immediately shall be decreased proportionally (in the case of a subdivision) or increased proportionally (in the case of a combination). any such adjustment shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. 4.4 reclassification or reorganization . if the common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be changed into the same or different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for in section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for in section 4.5 below), then and in each such event the holder shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this warrant the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock (or any shares of stock or other securities which may be) issuable upon the exercise of this warrant would have received if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or other change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. 4.5 merger, consolidation or sale of assets . if at any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the common stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this section 4) or a merger or consolidation of the company with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the company&#146;s assets and properties to any other person or entity, then as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock (or any shares of stock or other securities which may be) issuable upon the exercise of this warrant would have received if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. 4.6 notice of adjustment and record dates . the company shall promptly notify the holder in writing of each adjustment or readjustment of the exercise price hereunder and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant. such notice shall state the adjustment or readjustment and show in reasonable detail the facts on which that adjustment or readjustment is based. in the event of any taking by the company of a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are

extent as waived or consented to by the holder, the company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this warrant and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the
