(b) priority on piggyback registrations. the company shall permit the ----------------------------------- holders to include all such registrable shares on-the-same terms and conditions as any similar securities, if any, of the company included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company or the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advise the holders in writing that the total amount of securities requested to be included in such piggyback registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the price per 7 share of the securities to be sold), then the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the holders and other holders of securities who have piggyback registration rights with respect thereto shall be reduced (to zero if necessary) pro rata on the basis of the number of common stock equivalents requested to be registered by each such holder or holder participating in such offering. (c) right to abandon. nothing in this section 3 shall create any ---------------- liability on the part of the company to the holders if the company in its sole discretion should decide not to file a registration statement proposed to be filed pursuant to section 3(a) hereof or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its filing and prior to the later of its effectiveness or the release of the registrable shares for public offering by the managing underwriter, in the case of an underwritten public offering, regardless of any action whatsoever that a holder may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance by the company of any notice hereunder or otherwise. 4. holdback agreement. if (i) the company shall file a registration ------------------ statement with respect to the common stock or similar securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, such securities and (ii) the company (in the case of a nonunderwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the holders in writing that a public sale or distribution of registrable shares would materially adversely affect such offering or the managing underwriter or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the company in writing (in which case the company shall notify the holders) that a public sale or distribution of registrable shares would have material adverse impact on such offering, then each holder shall, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, refrain from effecting any public sale or distribution of registrable shares during the 10 days prior to the effective date of such registration statement and until the earliest of (a) the abandonment of such offering, (b) 90 days from the effective date of such registration statement and (c) if such offering is an underwritten offering, the termination of any "hold back" period

(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section ------------ 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses (other than in accordance with its terms), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the this section 8(d). notwithstanding the provision of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a holder shall not be required to contribute any amount which is in excess of the amount by which the total proceeds received by such holder from the sale of the registrable shares sold by such holder (net of all underwriting discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 15 9. rule 144. if the company shall have filed a registration -------- statement pursuant to the requirements of section 12 of the exchange act or a registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the securities act, the company covenants that it will timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act or the exchange act (including but not limited to the reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the exchange act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of rule 144 adopted by the sec under the securities act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder (or if the company is not required to file such reports, the company will, upon the request of any holder of registrable shares, make publicly available other information), and will take such further action as any holder of registrable shares may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder of registrable shares to sell registrable shares within the exemption provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. upon the request of any holder of registrable shares, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 10. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) termination. this agreement and the obligations of the company ----------- and the holders hereunder (other than section 8 hereof) shall terminate on the first date on which no registrable shares remain outstanding.

(d) resignation. the executive may voluntarily resign his employment ----------- hereunder (i) at any time during the first year following the effective date, for any reason or no reason, upon no more than 90 and no fewer than 60 days prior written notice to the board of directors and (ii) during the second and third years following the effective date, (a) upon written notice to the board of directors given at any time with immediate effect, for "good reason" (as defined immediately below) or (b) upon no more than 90 and no fewer than 60 days prior written notice to the board of directors given at any time, for any reason or no reason, specifying in each case, whether resignation is pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) above. the executive shall have "good 8 reason" to terminate his employment with the company upon the occurrence of either of the following events: (x) the company should fail to continue to employ the executive during the employment term in a manner consistent with section 3 and in the same executive capacity with the company in which the executive was employed by panamsat corporation immediately prior to the merger, with materially the same duties and responsibilities with the company that the executive had with panamsat corporation immediately prior to the merger; provided, that the executive shall be required prior to the effectiveness of a constructive termination pursuant to this subsection (x) to have given the company twenty (20) days notice and an opportunity to cure such failure. without in any way limiting the right of the executive to elect to terminate his services under section 7(d)(ii)(a), it is understood that any change in the executive's job description, offices, perquisites or place of employment by more than 35 miles, any reduction in the number of officers or other employees or diminishment in the overall management responsibility of officers and other employees reporting directly to the executive, any diminishment in the decision making authority of the executive shall each be a change in his duties and responsibilities that will give the executive the right to elect to terminate his services under section 7(d)(ii)(a); or 9 (y) the company should reduce or fail to pay or award to the executive when due any base salary, incentive bonus or other amount payable to the executive or to provide the executive with any benefits to which the executive is entitled. (e) discretionary termination by the company. upon delivery of ---------------------------------------- written notice of termination of the executive's employment for a reason other than material breach, death or disability from the company to the executive, the employment period shall be deemed to have terminated 60 days after the written notice is delivered to the executive. (f) continuation of salary and benefits. in the event the executive's ----------------------------------- employment terminates during the employment period as of result of his death as set forth in paragraph 7(a), or as a result of the executive's disability as set forth in paragraph 7(b), the company shall pay to the executive or his estate, as the case may be, his base salary and any employee benefits, including group medical benefits, to which he would otherwise be entitled under this agreement, for 12 months from the date of termination of employment.

(b) interference. the executive hereby agrees that until such time as ------------ the restrictions contained in section 9(a) lapse in accordance with their terms, he will not intentionally interfere with the company's relationship with, or endeavor to entice away from the company, any employee, person, firm, corporation, or other business organization who or which was an employee, customer or supplier of, or maintained a business relationship with, any business of the company which was conducted at any time prior to the termination date. nothing in this section 9(b) prohibits the executive from employing or doing business with any employee, person, firm, corporation or other business organization who, by his or its own choice, seeks to be employed or do business with the executive. (c) the executive expressly acknowledges and understands that the remedy of law for any breach by him of this section 9 will be inadequate, and that the damages flowing from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon the executive's violation of any provision of this section 9, the company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining 16 any threatened or further breach. nothing in this section 9 shall be deemed to limit the company's remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the executive of any of the provisions of this section 9 which may be pursued or availed of by the company.

termination payment or any ---------- other amounts payable to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under this agreement or under any plan, program or policy of the company, or any benefits provided to executive or his dependents under this agreement or under any option or other plan, program or policy of the company, should become subject to the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the internal revenue code or any similar tax or assessment (collectively, "excise taxes"), the company shall pay to the executive, his designated beneficiary 17 or his dependents, as the case may be, on demand, the amount (the "excise tax reimbursement amount"), necessary fully to reimburse the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents for (i) all excise taxes that may be imposed on the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents and (ii) any and all income and other taxes, including additional excise taxes, that may be imposed on the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents in respect of any of the amounts to be paid to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under clause (i) above or under this clause (ii). the determination of the excise tax reimbursement amount shall initially be made by the accounting firm that is serving as the company's independent public accountants immediately prior to the date of termination of the executive's employment, or, if such accounting firm is no longer in existence, by its successor. all costs and expenses of such accounting firm in connection with making such determination shall be paid by the company. if it is subsequently determined (as a result of an assessment of additional excise taxes by the internal revenue service or otherwise) that the excise tax reimbursement amount is not sufficient fully to reimburse the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents as contemplated above, the company shall pay to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents, as the case may be, on demand, the amount (the "additional excise tax reimbursement amount") necessary 18 fully to reimburse the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents for (i) any and all additional excise taxes, income taxes and other taxes that may be imposed on the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents, (ii) any and all interest,

executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under clause (i) or (ii) above or under this clause (iii). if it is subsequently determined that the executive has received a sum greater than necessary to pay any such excise taxes, the executive shall promptly return such overage to the company. the purpose of this paragraph 10 is to place the executive, his designated beneficiary and his dependents in the same position on an after-tax basis that each of them would have been in if the termination payment and all other amounts payable to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under this agreement or under any plan, program or policy of the company, and all benefits provided to the executive or his dependents under this agreement or under any plan, program or 19 policy of the company, had not been subject to any excise taxes. 11. attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses. the executive, his -------------------------------------------- designated beneficiary and his dependents (and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives) shall each be entitled to recover from the company (and shall be reimbursed by the

designated beneficiary or his dependents under this agreement, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or other proceeding relating to such enforcement or defense. the executive, his designated beneficiary and his dependents (and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives) also shall be entitled to recover from the company interest on the termination

under the first sentence of this section, any excise tax reimbursement amount or additional excise tax reimbursement amount under paragraph 10 hereof that are not paid when due, at an annual rate equal to 4% over the corporate base rate as announced from time to time by citibank, n.a. or its successor 20 (changing as and when such announced corporate base rate changes), compounded monthly, from the date due until paid. payments received by the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents (or any of their respective heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives) shall be credited first against accrued interest until all accrued interest is paid in full before any such payment is credited against the termination payment or any other amounts that may be payable to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under this agreement. 12. governing law. this agreement will be governed by and construed ------------- in accordance with the laws of the state of connecticut, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws. 13. binding effect; delegation of duties prohibited. this agreement

not assign or delegate his performance of this agreement. 14. ownership of company property. all written materials, records ----------------------------- and documents made by the executive or coming into his possession during the employment period concerning the company (other than personal tax and similar information provided by the company for personal use by the 21 executive) and all tangible

termination date or upon the request of the company during the employment period, the executive shall promptly deliver the same to the company. 15. waiver of breach. the waiver by the company of a breach of any ---------------- provision of this agreement by the executive shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the executive. the waiver by the executive of a
