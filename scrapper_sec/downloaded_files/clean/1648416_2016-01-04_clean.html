(f) mr. ferrari is a citizen of the republic of italy. &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. &#160; this schedule 13d relates to common shares of ferrari received by the reporting persons pursuant to a series of transactions (the &#8220;separation&#8221;) that separated ferrari from fiat chrysler automobiles n.v. (&#8220;fca&#8221;) and are summarized below. the separation included a restructuring of ferrari that preceded and was intended to enable the initial public offering of ferrari (the &#8220;ipo&#8221;).&#160;&#160;upon completion of this restructuring on october 19, 2015, ferrari n.v., formerly known as new business netherlands nv and the predecessor company of the issuer (&#8220;predecessor ferrari&#8221;) became the new holding company of the ferrari group.&#160;&#160;on such date, fca held 90% of the common shares and 90% of the special voting shares of predecessor ferrari, and mr. ferrari held 10% of the common shares and 10% of the special voting shares of predecessor ferrari.&#160;&#160;fca and mr. ferrari previously held 90% of and 10%, respectively, of the ordinary shares of ferrari s.p.a., the former parent company of the ferrari business and currently a subsidiary of the issuer. shortly following the completion of this restructuring, fca sold common shares of predecessor ferrari representing approximately 10% of predecessor ferrari&#8217;s share capital in the ipo with concurrent listing of the common shares of predecessor ferrari on the new york stock exchange. through two successive demerger transactions under dutch law completed on january 2, 2016, fca transferred its remaining 80% interest in the ferrari business to holders of its shares on a pro rata basis and to holders of fca&#8217;s 7.875% mandatory convertible securities (&#8220;mcss&#8221;).&#160;&#160;upon effectiveness of the demergers, each shareholder of fca received one ferrari common share for every 10 fca common shares and one ferrari special voting share for every 10 ferrari special voting shares held as of the record date of the demergers.&#160;&#160;in addition, ferrari issued common shares to holders of mcss, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the mcss. immediately prior to the demergers, exor held 375,803,870 common shares and 375,803,870 special voting shares of fca, as well as $886 million in aggregate notional amount of mcss.&#160;&#160;therefore, upon effectiveness of the demergers, in accordance with the demerger ratio described above and the terms of the mcss, exor received an aggregate of 44,435,280 common shares and 37,580,387 &#160; special voting shares in ferrari. shortly following completion of the demergers, predecessor ferrari was merged with and into the issuer (previously known as fe new n.v. and renamed ferrari n.v. upon effectiveness of the merger). pursuant to the merger, each holder (other than fe new n.v.) of common shares in predecessor ferrari, including mr. ferrari, received one common share in ferrari for each common share held in predecessor ferrari and each holder (other than fe new n.v.) of special voting shares in predecessor ferrari received one special voting share in ferrari for each special voting share held in predecessor ferrari n.v.; the common shares and special voting shares held by fe new n.v. in predecessor ferrari were cancelled pursuant to the merger.&#160;&#160;the merger became effective on january 3, 2016. &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; following completion of the separation, exor holds common shares representing approximately 23.5% of ferrari&#8217;s outstanding common shares. in light of the special voting shares as described above, exor&#8217;s voting power in ferrari is approximately 33.4%, calculated as the ratio of (i) the aggregate number of common shares and special voting shares beneficially owned by exor and (ii) the total number of outstanding common shares and outstanding special voting shares of ferrari. following completion of the separation, piero ferrari holds 18,892,160 common shares, representing 10% of ferrari&#8217;s outstanding common shares, and 18,892,160 special voting shares.&#160;&#160;his voting power in ferrari is approximately 15.4%. item 4. purpose of transaction. the principal objective of each of the reporting persons&#8217; investment in ferrari is the creation of value over time for all shareholders, by supporting ferrari&#8217;s business growth strategies which will be identified and adopted by the board of directors and the management of ferrari. neither reporting person has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (i) any acquisition by any person of additional securities of ferrari, or any disposition of securities of ferrari; (ii) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving ferrari or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of ferrari or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the present board of directors or management of ferrari, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of ferrari; (vi) any other material change in ferrari's business or corporate structure; (vii) any change in ferrari's charter or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of ferrari by any person; (viii) any delisting from a national securities exchange or any loss of authorization for quotation in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association of a class of securities of ferrari; (ix) any termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act of a class of equity securities of ferrari; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the reporting persons expects to evaluate on an ongoing basis ferrari&#8217;s financial condition and prospects and its interest in, and intentions with respect to, ferrari. in particular, exor may acquire additional shares in ferrari consistent with its general investment philosophy pursuant to which it seeks to hold controlling interests (generally 30% or more of such companies&#8217; shares) in companies in which it invests. accordingly, the reporting persons reserve the right to develop, modify or change their respective plans as they deem appropriate. for example, any of the reporting persons may at any time and from time to time (1) acquire additional securities of ferrari in open market or privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to the exercise of warrants, stock options or convertible or exchangeable securities; (2) dispose of such securities; (3) enter into privately negotiated derivative transactions with institutional counterparties to hedge the market risk of some or all of its positions in such securities; and/or (4) continue to hold such securities for investment purposes. any such transactions may be effected at any time and from time to time. in reaching any determination as to its future course of action, each reporting person may take into consideration various factors, such as ferrari's business and prospects, other developments concerning ferrari, other business opportunities available to the reporting persons, and general economic and stock market conditions, including, but not limited to, the market price of the common shares of ferrari. &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; representatives of either of the reporting persons may conduct discussions from time to time with one another as well as with management of the issuer, the issuer&#8217;s other shareholders and/or other relevant parties, including other companies that operate in the businesses and markets in which the issuer conducts its businesses, in each case relating to matters that may include the issuer&#8217;s strategic plans, business, financial condition, operations, and capital structure.&#160;&#160;the reporting persons may engage with any of the parties listed above in discussions that may include one or more of the other actions described in subsections (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d.&#160;&#160;as a result of these activities, any of the reporting persons may suggest, or take a position with respect to, potential changes in the operations, management, or capital structure of ferrari as a means of enhancing shareholder value. such suggestions or positions may relate to one or more of the transactions described in item 4(a) through (j) of schedule 13d under rule 13d-1(a), including, without limitation, such matters as disposing of one or more businesses; selling or merging ferrari or acquiring other companies or businesses; changing strategies; adopting, not adopting, modifying, or eliminating certain types of anti-takeover measures; modifying ferrari&#8217;s capitalization; reviewing dividend and compensation policies; entering into agreements with third parties relating to acquisitions of securities issued or to be issued by ferrari; entering into agreements with ferrari relating to acquisitions of shares in ferrari by members of management, issuance of options to management, or their employment by ferrari.&#160;&#160;in particular, exor expects from time to time to suggest appropriate candidates for election to the issuer&#8217;s board of directors in a manner consistent with the issuer&#8217;s then current governance policies. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. &#160;

6.1.1 with respect to any party, to a permitted transferee of any party; &#160; 6.1.2 in addition to clause 6.1.1, with respect to exor, (i) to any affiliate of giovanni agnelli e c. s.a.p.az., (ii) to a successor in business of giovanni agnelli e c. s.a.p.az. and/ or (iii) to any affiliate of a successor in business of giovanni agnelli e c. s.a.p.az.;

6.3.1 shall remain jointly and severally liable with the transferee that has acquired the common shares in fe new; and &#160; 6.3.2 shall procure that the entity to which the common shares in fe new have been transferred pursuant to clause 6.1 above does not lose its status as allowed thereunder without having previously transferred its common shares in fe new back to the original executing party of this agreement or to another entity having the status allowed by clause 6.1 above. &#160;

pf initial participation &#8221;); such faculty shall apply on a revolving basis within the above mentioned limit of 0.5 percent of the pf initial participation also if, from time to time through repurchases of common shares of fe new on the market, pf acquires back the whole or a portion of his original holding of common shares in fe new. &#160; notwithstanding the above, it is agreed that in case (i) pf intends to transfer all the common shares in fe new he owns at any time and (ii) in occasion of such transfer exor intends to exercise its pre-emption right, pf will remain obliged to serve to exor at least a number of common shares equal to ( x ) the pf initial participation less ( y ) the common shares &#160; in fe new &#160; of pf eventually previously acquired by exor pursuant to the pre-emption right and/or less such common shares of pf in fe new for which exor has forfeited or in any case has not exercised its pre-emption right pursuant to clause 4.4 above; accordingly if pf at any such time does not hold a sufficient number of common shares in fe new to comply with the above obligation, he shall purchase (on the market or from third parties) those common shares in fe new necessary to comply with the above obligation. 6.6 in addition to clause 6.1 and clause 6.5, each party shall also have the right to: &#160; 6.6.1 grant pledges or similar encumbrances to any bank, financial institution or other third party over the common shares in fe new owned by it on the condition that, save for events of default or acceleration under the relevant contractual documentation, the party maintains the voting rights related to such common shares; and &#160; 6.6.2 carry out other derivative transactions having a short term and not implying a change in the beneficial ownership of the common shares in fe new. &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160;

while exor cannot assume any binding obligation in this respect &#8211; it will use its best endeavours to assist pf in studying technical solutions through which this could happen. it remains understood and agreed that failure to find a solution (which will involve also the third purchaser) shall not in any way limit, delay or impede the timely execution of the sale. 9. confidentiality 9.1 the parties shall in all respects keep confidential and not at any time disclose or make known in any other way to anyone whomsoever or use for its own or any other person&#8217;s benefit or to the detriment of the other party any information (whether oral or recorded in any medium) relating to the business, financial or other affairs (including future plans) of the parties, provided that: &#160;
