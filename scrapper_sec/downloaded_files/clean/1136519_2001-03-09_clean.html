(b) issuance of common stock certificates. as soon as practicable after ------------------------------------- receipt of the conversion notice and surrender of the certificate or certificates for the shares of series b preferred stock to be converted, the corporation shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the converting holder a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of common stock issuable by reason of the conversion of such shares of series b preferred stock, registered in such name or names and such denominations as the converting holder has specified, subject to compliance with applicable laws to the extent such designation shall involve a transfer. in case the number of shares of series b preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion pursuant to this section 5.2 exceeds the number of shares converted, the corporation shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to the holder thereof a new certificate for the number of shares of series b preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered that are not to be converted. (c) effective time of conversion. to the extent permitted by law, the ---------------------------- conversion of the series b preferred stock pursuant to this section 5.2 into common stock shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date that all the conditions in section 5.2(a) of this certificate of designation have been satisfied, and at such time the rights 4 of the holder of such shares of series b preferred stock so converted shall cease, and the person or persons in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of common stock represented thereby. except as otherwise provided herein, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of the common stock delivered upon conversion of the series b preferred stock. 5.3 adjustments to conversion rate. (a) subdivision or combination of common stock. if the corporation at any ------------------------------------------ time: (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivides (by stock split, recapitalization, or otherwise) its outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combines (by reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares; then the conversion rate in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such subdivision or combination, shall be proportionately adjusted immediately thereafter so that the holder of any shares of the series b preferred stock surrendered for conversion after such event will receive the kind and amount of shares that such holder would have received if the series b preferred stock had been converted immediately prior to the happening of the event. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any of the events referred in this section 5.3(a) occur. (b) issuance of rights, warrants, or options. if the corporation shall ---------------------------------------- issue or grant any rights, warrants, or options to holders of its common stock, as a class, entitling all holders of the class to subscribe for or to purchase common stock at a price per share less than the current market price (as defined in section 5.3(e) hereof) at the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants, or options, the conversion rates will be reduced so that it will be the amount determined by multiplying (i) the conversion rates existing prior to the record date for the issuance of the rights, warrants, or options by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the numerator is the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate exercise price of all rights, warrants, or options would purchase at the current market price at the record date, and (y) the denominator is the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date for the issuance of the rights, warrants, or options, plus the number of additional shares of common stock issuable on the exercise of all rights, warrants, or options. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such rights, warrants, or options are issued or granted, and will become effective immediately. (c) certain dividends and distributions on common stock. in the event that --------------------------------------------------- the corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution to all holders of the common stock as a class payable in securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, or other property (excluding cash dividends or distributions of cash payable from retained earnings of the corporation, dividends payable in common stock, or distributions of rights, warrants, or options referred to in section 5.3(b) hereof, but including, without limitation, shares of any other class of the corporation's capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or any other class of the corporation's capital stock), then, in each such case, the conversion rate will be reduced so that it will equal the amount determined by multiplying (i) the 5 conversion rates in effect immediately prior to the record date for the distribution by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the numerator is the current market price of a share of common stock on the record date for the distribution, less the then fair market value (as determined by the board of directors, whose determination, if made in good faith, will be conclusive) of the capital stock, evidence of indebtedness, assets, or other property which are distributed with respect to one share of common stock and (y) the denominator is the current market price of one share of common stock on that record date. each adjustment shall be made successively whenever such distribution is made and shall be effective immediately after the record date for the distribution to shareholders entitled to receive the distribution. (d) merger or consolidation. if there is a reorganization, or a merger or ----------------------- consolidation of the corporation with or into any other entity which results in a conversion, exchange, or cancellation of the common stock, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, on a consolidated basis (except for sales or dispositions to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the corporation), upon any subsequent conversion of the series b preferred stock, each holder of the series b preferred stock will be entitled to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash, and other property or assets which the holder would have received if the holder had converted the shares of series b preferred stock into common stock in accordance with section 5 hereof immediately prior to the first of these events and had retained all the securities, cash, and other property or assets received as a result of those events. (e) events excluded from conversion rate adjustment. no adjustment shall ----------------------------------------------- be made to the conversion rate if shares of common stock are issued at rates below the conversion rate or the current market rate in connection with any of the following events: (i) securities issued as a result of any stock split or stock dividend; (ii) up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued to employees, consultants or directors of the company pursuant to the stock option plan adopted by the board on august 18, 1997; (iii) securities issued pursuant to the conversion of series a preferred stock; and (iv) securities issued pursuant to warrants outstanding as of the date hereof.

(g) de minimus adjustments. no adjustment in the conversion rates will be made unless the adjustment would require a change of at least one percent (1%) in the conversion rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which are not -------- ------- made because of this section 5.3(g) will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and provided, further, that any adjustment -------- ------- must be made in accordance with this section 5 (without regard to this section 5.3(g)) not later than the time the adjustment may be required in order to preserve the tax-free nature, if any, of a distribution to the holders of shares of the common stock. all calculations under this section 5 will be made to the nearest full share. 5.4 notices.

statement pursuant to section 3.3(a) of this agreement, allocated on a pro rata basis among the holders thereof based upon the total number of shares of such other securities proposed to be included in the registration. notwithstanding any of the foregoing, securities which are not registrable securities shall only be included in such demand registration statement to the extent that, in the opinion of the underwriters, such securities can be sold without having an adverse effect on the company. registrable securities excluded or withdrawn from the underwriting in accordance with this

statement (and related qualifications under blue sky laws) and the underwriting, if any, involved therein, all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received a written request for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the piggyback notice (five (5) days if the company gives telephonic notice to all registered holders of the registrable securities, with written confirmation to follow promptly thereafter). notwithstanding the above, the company may determine, at any time, not to proceed with such piggyback registration statement. such determination, however, will be without prejudice to the rights of holders of registrable securities to demand the continuation of such registration statement under section 3 hereof. 4.2 underwriting agreement. to the extent that the holders of ---------------------- registrable securities request piggyback registration of their registrable securities, the holders of registrable securities shall (together with the company) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter, if any, selected by the company for such underwriting. 4.3 priority on primary registrations. if a piggyback registration --------------------------------- involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters of any such proposed public offering delivers a written opinion to the company and the holders of registrable securities requesting registration under this section 4 that the total number or kind of securities which such holders and any other persons entitled to be included in such public offering would adversely affect its ability to effect such an offering, then the company may limit some or all the registrable securities and other securities that may be included in such registration and underwriting to the extent of the number or kind of securities which the company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without having such an adverse effect, such that: (a) first, all securities proposed by the company to be sold for its own account, (b) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration pro rata among the holders of the registrable securities requesting such registration, on the basis of the total number of shares of such securities that each such holder of the registrable securities otherwise proposed to include in the piggyback registration. 4.4 priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration ----------------------------------- is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the company's securities other than holders of registrable securities (the "other holders"), ------------- and the managing underwriter or underwriters advises the company in writing that in their opinion the number and kind of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering, then the company will include in such registration (a) first, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration hereunder up to that number which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold in such offering, and if all such registrable securities can not be so included, then pro rata among the holders of registrable securities requesting such registration on the basis of the number of shares of registrable securities each holder otherwise sought to have included in the piggyback registration, and (b) second, the securities requested to be included therein by

for payment of any underwriting fees if such holders have requested participation of an underwriting with respect to an offering subject to demand registration or have elected to participate in a piggyback registration using their own underwriter. any such expenses which are common to the holders of the registrable securities included in the registration shall be divided among such holders pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of registrable securities being registered on behalf of such holder, or as such holders may otherwise agree. 7. indemnification. 7.1 indemnification by company. in the event of any registration of -------------------------- any registrable securities under the securities act, the company hereby agrees to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and hold harmless each seller of the registrable securities hereby, its officers, directors, employees, partners, agents, and each person who controls (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) such holder or acts on behalf of such holder, and each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such registrable securities, against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with defending against any such losses, claims, damages and liabilities or in connection with any investigation or inquiry, in each case caused by or based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement in which such registrable securities are registered under the securities act, prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any 13 omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the company will reimburse each such indemnified person for any reasonable legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them or any of them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim (or action or proceeding in respect thereof); provided, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the -------- ---- extent that (i) same arises out of or is based on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder of registrable securities specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof, (ii) such holder or any underwriter or selling agents failed to deliver a copy of the prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense if the company had furnished such holder with a reasonably sufficient number of copies of the same, or (iii) such holder has violated the provisions of section 5.2 hereof. in connection with an underwritten offering, the company will indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls (within the meaning of the securities act) such underwriters at least to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of a holder or any such underwriter and shall survive the transfer of the registrable securities by a holder. 7.2 indemnification by sellers. in connection with any registration -------------------------- statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder will furnish to the company in writing information concerning such holder that is required by the provisions of applicable law and regulation to be included in a registration statement as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, each such holder, jointly and severally, will indemnify the company, its directors and officers, and each person who controls (within the meaning of the securities act) the company against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement -------- ------- contained in this section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and provided, further, that, in no event shall -------- ------- any indemnity under this section 7.2 exceed the net proceeds from the offering actually received by such holder. 7.3 assumption of defense by indemnifying party. any person entitled ------------------------------------------- to indemnification hereunder will (a) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (b) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, -------- ------- that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of any such person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claims on behalf of such person). if such 14 defense is not assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). an indemnifying party which is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which case the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels. the failure of any indemnified party to provide the notice required by section 7.3(a) above shall not relieve the indemnifing party under this section 7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. 7.4 contribution. if for any reason the indemnification provided for ------------ in sections 7.1 and 7.2 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by sections 7.1 and 7.2, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7.5 binding effect. the indemnification provided for under this -------------- agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities. 8. participation in underwritten registrations. 8.1 underwriting arrangements. no person may participate in any ------------------------- registration statement hereunder which is underwritten unless such person (a) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under such underwriting arrangements. 8.2 agreement to provide information. each holder of registrable -------------------------------- securities seeking registration of its registrable securities pursuant to the terms of this agreement, whether pursuant to section 3 or section 4 hereof, will furnish promptly to the company and any managing underwriter such information regarding such holder and the proposed distribution of the registrable shares by such holder as they may request and as may be required in connection with any registration, qualification, or compliance referred to in this agreement. in the event that a holder of registrable securities fails or refuses to provide such information for any reason within a reasonable time after a request therefor by the company or the managing underwriter, if any, the company will be relieved of obligations to include such registrable securities in such registration. 9. general provisions. 9.1 no inconsistent agreements. the company will not on or after the -------------------------- date hereof, without the consent of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the registrable securities, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the 15 holders of registrable securities in this agreement, grants to any person or entity rights as to registration that all superior to are more beneficial than the rights granted hereunder, or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. the rights granted to holders of registrable securities hereunder do not in any way conflict with any other agreement to which the company is a party. 9.2 remedies. all remedies under this agreement, or by law or -------- otherwise afforded to any party hereto, shall be cumulative and not alternative. any person having rights under any provision of this agreement will be entitled to enforce such rights specifically to recover damages caused by reason of any breach of any provision of this agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law. the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this agreement and that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction (without posting any bond or other security) for specific performance and for other injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent violation of the provisions of this agreement. 9.3 term. except as specifically otherwise provided herein, the ---- provisions of this agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of: (i) no registrable securities remain outstanding, (ii) all of the registrable securities may be transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the provisions of rule 144(e) or 144(k) promulgated under the securities act, or (iii) on the fifth anniversary of this agreement. 9.4 amendments and waivers. except as otherwise specifically ---------------------- provided herein, this agreement may be amended or waived only upon the prior written consent of the company and the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of registrable securities. 9.5 assignment. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to ----------- the benefit and be enforceable by the parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. in addition, whether or not any express assignment has been made, the provisions of this agreement which are for the benefit of holders of registrable securities also are for the benefit of, and enforceable by, any subsequent holder of such registrable securities so long as, and to the extent that, such securities continue to be registrable securities. 9.6 severability. whenever possible, each provision of this ------------ agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this agreement. 9.7 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in multiple ------------ counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. 9.8 descriptive headings. the descriptive headings of this agreement -------------------- are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this agreement. 9.9 governing law. all questions concerning the construction, ------------- validity and interpretation of this agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the state of nevada, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or 16 rule (whether of the state of nevada or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of nevada. 9.10 entire agreement. this agreement is intended by the parties as ---------------- a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect of the subject matter contained herein. this agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with
