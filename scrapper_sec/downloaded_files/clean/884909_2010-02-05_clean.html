(a) - (b) on february 2, 2010, the parent, the purchaser and the company entered into the merger agreement. the merger agreement contemplates that the purchaser will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company through the offer at a price of $11.50 per share (such price, or any greater price per share that is paid in the offer, referred to as the &#147;offer price&#148;), without interest thereon and subject to any required withholding taxes. the merger agreement also provides that after completion of the offer, the purchaser will be merged with the company (the &#147;merger&#148;), and that the company will be the surviving corporation in the merger. upon the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock (other than shares of common stock held in the treasury of the company, held by any subsidiary of the company, held by the parent or any of its subsidiaries, or held by any person that has properly exercised their dissenters&#146; right under delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the offer price in cash. as an inducement to the parent and the purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, each of the stockholders has entered into a stockholder agreement pursuant to which the stockholder has agreed to tender in the offer all issued and outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common stock now owned or hereafter acquired by the stockholder and, if necessary, to vote all such shares of common stock in favor of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. each stockholder agreement includes an irrevocable proxy granted by the stockholder to the parent and the purchaser securing the obligation of the stockholder to vote in favor of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. as of february 2, 2010, the stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 3,724,391 shares of common stock. this number of shares includes shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,117,700 shares of common stock exercisable within 60 days after february 2, 2010, leaving an aggregate of 2,606,691 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of february 2, 2010 that are subject to the stockholder agreements. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and the stockholders agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements included as exhibits 7.1 through 7.7, which are incorporated by reference herein.

(e) pursuant to the merger agreement, the company may not (i) authorize or effect any stock split or combination or reclassification of shares of its capital stock, (ii) declare or pay any dividend or distribution with respect to its capital stock or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any shares of its capital stock or any other securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of its capital stock or (iii) issue or authorize the issuance of any shares of its capital stock (other than in connection with the exercise of currently outstanding stock options) or any other securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of its capital stock. (f) if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, the surviving corporation in the merger will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent. (g) the merger agreement contains provisions that prohibit the company or any of its subsidiaries from (i) amending its organizational documents, (ii) merging or consolidating with any entity, (iii) selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of any of its capital assets having an aggregate value in excess of $500,000, other than in the ordinary course of business, including in the case of the company any shares of the capital stock of any of its subsidiaries or (iv) liquidating, dissolving or effecting any recapitalization or reorganization in any form. the merger agreement also includes prohibitions on the ability of the company and certain other persons to solicit or encourage any acquisition proposals from third parties and restrictions on the ability of the company with respect to unsolicited acquisition proposals. (h) pursuant to the merger agreement, the company will apply for delisting of its common stock from the nasdaq global select market promptly after the consummation of the merger. (i) upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the common stock of the company may become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act.
