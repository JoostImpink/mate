(b) if stock elections are received for a number of company shares that is 65% or less of the outstanding company shares, each company share covered by a stock election shall be converted in the merger into 0.5816 of a share of purchaser stock (the "conversion fraction"). the parties hereto acknowledge that the conversion fraction was based on an agreed upon value of $9.00 per share of purchaser stock. in the event that between the date of this agreement and the effective time, the issued and outstanding shares of purchaser stock shall have been affected or changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar transaction, the conversion fraction shall be appropriately adjusted. (c) if stock elections are received for more than 65% of the outstanding company shares, each non-electing company share (as defined in section 1.5(g)) and each company share for which a cash election has been received shall be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in the merger, and the company shares for which stock elections have been received shall be converted into purchaser stock and the right to receive the cash consideration in the following manner: (1) the exchange agent will distribute to each holder of company shares as to which a stock election has been made a number of shares of purchaser stock equal to the conversion fraction for a fraction of such company shares, the numerator of which fraction shall be 65% of -5- 11 the number of then outstanding company shares and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of company shares as to which stock elections have been made. (2) company shares covered by a stock election and not fully converted into the right to receive purchaser stock as set forth in clause (1) above shall be converted in the merger into the right to receive the cash consideration for each such company share, in an amount to offset the reduction of shares of purchaser stock affected pursuant to clause (1) above. (d) if cash elections are received for a number of company shares that is 35% or less of the outstanding company shares, each company share covered by a cash election shall be converted in the merger into the right to receive the cash consideration. (e) if cash elections are received for a number of company shares that is more than 35% of the outstanding company shares, each non-electing company share (as defined in section 1.5(g)) and each company share for which a stock election has been received shall be converted in the merger into a fraction of a share of purchaser stock equal to the conversion fraction, and the company shares for which cash elections have been received shall be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration and purchaser stock in the following manner: (1) the exchange agent will distribute to each holder of company shares as to which a cash election has been made the cash consideration for a fraction of such company shares, the numerator of which fraction shall be 35% of the number of then outstanding company shares and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of company shares covered by cash elections. (2) company shares covered by a cash election and not fully converted into the right to receive the cash consideration as set forth in clause (1) above shall be converted in the merger into the right to receive a number of shares of purchaser stock equal to the conversion fraction for each such company share to offset the reduction in cash consideration affected pursuant to clause (1) above. (f) if non-electing company shares are not converted under either section 1.5(c) or section 1.5(e), the exchange agent shall convert each non-electing company share into such combination of purchaser stock and cash consideration such that the sum of the number of company shares converted into cash pursuant to this section 1.5(f) and the number of company shares for which cash elections have been received is as close as practicable to 35% of the outstanding company shares. the portion of each non-electing company share not so converted into the right to receive the cash consideration pursuant to clause (i) above shall be -6- 12 converted in the merger into a fraction of a share of purchaser stock equal to the conversion fraction. (g) for the purposes of this section 1.5, outstanding company shares as to which an election is not in effect at the election deadline shall be called "non-electing company shares." if purchaser and the company shall determine that any election is not properly made with respect to any company shares, such election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the company shares covered by such election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be non-electing company shares. (h) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of purchaser stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to company shares shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of purchaser. in lieu of any such fractional share of purchaser stock, purchaser shall pay to each former stockholder of the company who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of purchaser stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the purchaser share price by (ii) the fractional interest in a share of purchaser stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. 1.6. issuance of purchaser stock. immediately prior to the effective time, purchaser shall deliver, in trust, to the exchange agent certificates representing an aggregate number of shares of purchaser stock as nearly as practicable equal to the number of shares to be converted into purchaser stock as determined in section 1.5. as soon as practicable after the effective time, each holder of company shares converted into purchaser stock pursuant to section 1.3(a), upon surrender to the exchange agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a form of election) of one or more certificates for such company shares for cancellation, shall be entitled to receive certificates representing the number of shares of purchaser stock into which such company shares shall have been converted in the merger. no dividends or distributions that have been declared will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates for shares of purchaser stock until such persons surrender their certificates for company shares, at which time all such dividends shall be paid. in no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive interest on such dividends. if any certificate for such purchaser stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate for company shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of certificates for such purchaser stock in a name other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the exchange agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of company shares for any purchaser stock or dividends thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. -7- 13 1.7. payment of cash consideration. immediately following the effective time, purchaser shall deposit in trust with the exchange agent an amount in cash up to an amount equal to the purchaser share price multiplied by the number of company shares to be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration as determined in section 1.5. as soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall distribute to holders of company shares converted into the right to receive the cash consideration pursuant to section 1.3(a), upon surrender to the exchange agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a form of election) of one or more certificates for such company shares for cancellation, a bank check for an amount equal to the purchaser share price times the number of company shares so converted. in no event shall the holder of any such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any of the cash consideration to be received in the merger. if such check is to be issued in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the certificates for the company shares surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of such check to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the exchange agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of company shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 1.8. options.
