(e) if the corporation elects to pay dividends in additional shares, the number of additional shares to be issued as dividends will equal the cash amount of the dividend that would have been payable if dividends were paid in cash, divided by the initial liquidation preference.

(a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of junior securities, the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to each share of series a preferred stock an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders plus an amount in cash equal to the liquidation preference. if, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any parity securities, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of shares of series a preferred stock and any such other parity securities ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares of series a preferred stock and any such other parity securities if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. (b) upon the completion of the distribution required by section 5(a) and any other distribution that may be required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, the holders of series a preferred stock and the holders of series b preferred stock shall participate with the common stock ratably on an as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock) in the distribution of 7 assets, or the proceeds thereof, until the holders of series a preferred stock shall have received (including amounts paid pursuant to section 5(a)) an aggregate of $1,500.00 per share of series a preferred stock (in each case as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like); thereafter, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, if assets remain in the corporation, the holders of the common stock of the corporation shall receive the distribution of assets, or the proceeds thereof, until such time as the holders of common stock shall have received, in the aggregate, distributions equal to their pro-rata percentage of the shares of the corporation as if the holders of series a preferred stock and the holders of series b preferred stock were participating with the common stock (and were not entitled to any preference thereto) on an as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock) beginning with the first dollar paid in such liquidation, dissolution or winding up; thereafter, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, if assets remain in the corporation the holders of the common stock, the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock shall participate in the remaining distributions on as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock). (c) notwithstanding anything else in this certificate of designation, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation shall be deemed to have occurred upon (a) (i) the acquisition of the corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation, whether of the corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations or of any other corporation or corporations with or into the corporation, but excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation); or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation; provided that a consolidation or merger as a result of which the holders of capital stock of the corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation possess (by reason of such holdings) 50% or more of the voting power of the corporation surviving such merger or consolidation (or other corporation which is the issuer of the capital stock into which the capital stock of the corporation is converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation) shall not be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation within the meaning of this paragraph 5 or (b) a transaction or series of transactions in which a person or group of persons (as defined in rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the exchange act) (excluding the initial holder of the series a preferred stock or any of its affiliates) acquires beneficial ownership (as determined in accordance with rule 13d-3 of the exchange act) of more than 50% of the common stock or the voting power of the corporation. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a deemed 8 liquidation, dissolution or winding up pursuant to this section 5(c) as a result of a transaction in which substantially all of the consideration received by the corporation's stockholders is capital stock of the surviving corporation or the parent thereof (such issuer, the "new issuer"), if the board of directors of the surviving corporation determines that the payment of cash pursuant to section 5(a) would have a material adverse effect on the surviving corporation, the parent thereof or the transaction, each holder of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to receive, in exchange for its shares of series a preferred stock and in lieu of payments otherwise payable pursuant to sections 5(a) and 5(b), at its election, either (x) capital stock in such amounts and in such form as would have been received had such holder converted all of its series a preferred stock immediately prior to such transaction or (y) securities of the new issuer equivalent in rights and preferences to the series a preferred stock. 6. redemption. (a) the series a preferred stock shall not be redeemable by the corporation prior to the first call date. all shares of series a preferred stock shall be redeemable at the option of the corporation to the extent the corporation shall have funds legally available for such payment, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, (i) on and after the second call date, or, (ii) if the minimum call stock price test has been satisfied, on and after the first call date, at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. (b) shares of series a preferred stock which have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the state of delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of preferred stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of the preferred stock; provided that no such issued and reacquired shares of series a preferred stock shall be reissued or sold as series a preferred stock. 7. procedure for redemption. (a) in the event that fewer than all the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the board of directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or pro rata (with any fractional shares being rounded to the nearest whole share) as may be determined by the board of directors. (b) in the event the corporation shall redeem shares of series a preferred stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock register of the corporation; provided that neither the failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall 9 affect the validity of the giving of notice for the redemption of any share of series a preferred stock to be redeemed except as to the holder to whom the corporation has failed to give said notice or except as to the holder whose notice was defective. each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date (which shall be a date on or after the first call date); (ii) the number of shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder (which if less than all of the shares outstanding, must be on a pro-rata basis); (iii) the redemption price formula; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. (c) notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the redemption date, dividends on the shares of series a preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the corporation (except the right to receive from the corporation the redemption price) shall cease. upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the board of directors of the corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the corporation at the redemption price as aforesaid. in case fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. 8. conversion. (a) subject to the provisions of this paragraph 8, the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, at such holder's option, to convert any or all outstanding shares (and fractional shares) of series a preferred stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock. the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of a share of series a preferred stock as of any date shall be an amount equal to the liquidation preference divided by the adjusted conversion price. notwithstanding any call for redemption pursuant to paragraph 6, the right to convert shares so called for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the date immediately preceding the date fixed for such redemption unless the corporation shall default in making payment of the amount payable upon such redemption. (b) (i) in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of the shares of series a preferred stock to be converted shall surrender the certificate representing such shares at the office of the corporation, with a written notice of election to convert completed and signed, specifying the number of shares to be converted. unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in 10 which such shares of series a preferred stock are registered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder or the holder's duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax. (ii) as promptly as practicable after the surrender by a holder of certificates for shares of series a preferred stock as aforesaid, the corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder, or on the holder's written order to the holder's transferee, (w) a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 8, (x) any cash adjustment required pursuant to paragraph 8(f) and (y) in the event of a conversion in part, a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of series a preferred stock not being so converted. (iii) each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the certificates for shares of series a preferred stock shall have been surrendered and such notice received by the corporation as aforesaid, and the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of common stock represented thereby at such time on such date and such conversion shall be into a number of shares of common stock equal to the product of the number of shares of series a preferred stock surrendered times the liquidation preference divided by the adjusted conversion price in effect at such time on such date. all shares of common stock delivered upon conversion of the series a preferred stock will upon delivery be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights. upon the surrender of certificates representing shares of series a preferred stock, such shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares surrendered for conversion shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the common stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph 8 and a certificate or certificates representing shares of series a preferred stock not converted. 11 (c) (i) upon delivery to the corporation by a holder of shares of series a preferred stock of a notice of election to convert, the right of the corporation to redeem such shares of series a preferred stock shall terminate, regardless of whether a notice of redemption has been mailed as aforesaid. (ii) except as provided above and in paragraph 8(g), the corporation shall make no payment or adjustment for accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of series a preferred stock, whether or not in arrears, on conversion of such shares or for dividends in cash on the shares of common stock issued upon such conversion. (d) (i) the corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as shall be required for the purpose of effecting conversions of the series a preferred stock. (ii) prior to the delivery of any securities which the corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, the corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the corporation. (e) the corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of the series a preferred stock pursuant hereto; provided that the corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the series a preferred stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. (f) in connection with the conversion of any shares of series a preferred stock, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the market price per share of common stock on the business day on which such shares of series a preferred stock are deemed to have been converted. (g) (i) in case the corporation shall at any time after the date of issue of the series a preferred stock (a) declare a dividend or make a distribution on common stock payable in common stock, (b) subdivide or split the outstanding common stock, (c) combine or 12 reclassify the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, (d) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of common stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation), or (e) consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other person, the conversion ratio in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or of the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, merger or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of the series a preferred stock after such time shall entitle the holder to receive the aggregate number of shares of common stock or other securities of the corporation (or shares of any security into which such shares of common stock have been combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified pursuant to clause 8(g)(i)(c), 8(g)(i)(d) or 8(g)(i)(e) above) which, if this series a preferred stock had been converted immediately prior to such time, such holder would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, merger or reclassification, assuming such holder of common stock of the corporation (x) is not a person with which the corporation consolidated or into which the corporation merged or which merged into the corporation or to which such recapitalization, sale or transfer was made, as the case may be ("constituent person"), or an affiliate of a constituent person and (y) failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer (provided, that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer is not the same for each share of common stock of the corporation held immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer by other than a constituent person or an affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this subparagraph 8(g) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (ii) in case the corporation shall issue or sell any common stock (other than common stock issued (a) pursuant to the corporation's stock option plans or pursuant to any other common stock related employee compensation plans of the 13 corporation approved by the corporation's board of directors or its predecessors (including such plans under section 423 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended) (collectively, "stock plans") or pursuant to obligations of the corporation existing prior to the issue date to issue shares of common stock, other than obligations under employee retention agreements (as defined below)("existing obligations") or (b) upon exercise or conversion of any security the issuance of which caused an adjustment under paragraphs 8(g)(iii) or 8(g)(iv) hereof) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then trigger value, the conversion ratio to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale plus the number of shares of common stock into which the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock are convertible (assuming the series b preferred stock were convertible into common stock at the same rate as the series a preferred stock) immediately prior to such issuance or sale (the "convert total") and (ii) the current valuation per common share (as defined in paragraph 8(g)(vi)) immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or sale plus the convert total and (ii) the current valuation per common share immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the aggregate consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon such issuance or sale, but in no event will such fraction be less than one. in case any portion of the consideration to be received by the corporation shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be utilized in the foregoing computation. such fair market value shall be determined by the board of directors of the corporation; provided that if the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock shall object to any such determination, the board of directors shall retain an independent appraiser reasonably satisfactory to such holders to determine such fair market value. the holders shall be notified promptly of any consideration other than cash to be received by the corporation and furnished with a description of the consideration and the fair market value thereof, as determined by the board of directors. 14 (iii) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to the holders of its common stock or other securities entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock (or securities convertible into shares of common stock) at a price per share of common stock (or having a conversion price per share of common stock, if a security convertible into shares of common stock) less than the then trigger value on such record date, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants (or conversion of such convertible securities) shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of such record date and the conversion ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 8(g)(ii) hereof, as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities prior to their receipt of such shares of common stock. in case any portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined as set forth in paragraph 8(g)(ii) hereof. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or expire unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph 8(g)), the conversion ratio shall again be adjusted to be the conversion ratio which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed, in the former event, or the conversion ratio which would then be in effect if such holder had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock, in the latter event. (iv) in case the corporation shall issue rights, options (other than options issued pursuant to a stock plan) or warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase common stock (or securities convertible into shares of common stock) or shall issue convertible securities, and the price per share of common stock of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities (including, in the case of rights, options or warrants, the price at which they may be exercised) is less than the then trigger value, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of such convertible securities shall be deemed to have 15 been issued and outstanding as of the date of such sale or issuance, and the conversion ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph 8(g)(ii) hereof as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration equal to the aggregate consideration paid for such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities and the aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities prior to their receipt of such shares of common stock. in case any portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined as set forth in paragraph 8(g)(ii) hereof. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are issued; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph 8(g)), the conversion ratio shall again be adjusted to be the conversion ratio which would then be in effect if such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities had not been issued, in the former event, or the conversion ratio which would then be in effect if such holders had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock, in the latter event. no adjustment of the conversion ratio shall be made pursuant to this paragraph 8(g)(iv) to the extent that the conversion ratio shall have been adjusted pursuant to paragraph 8(g)(iii) upon the setting of any record date relating to such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities and such adjustment fully reflects the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are entitled and the price payable therefor. (v) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to holders of common stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, assets or other property (other than dividends payable in common stock or rights, options or warrants referred to in, and for which an adjustment is made pursuant to, paragraph 8(g)(iii) hereof), the conversion ratio to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which shall be the current 16 valuation per common share on such record date, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the current valuation per common share on such record date, less the fair market value (determined as set forth in paragraph 8(g)(ii) hereof) of the portion of the assets, other property or evidence of indebtedness so to be distributed which is applicable to one share of common stock. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the conversion ratio shall again be adjusted to be the conversion ratio which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (vi) in the event that the corporation, directly or indirectly, pays consideration of more than $25 million, in the aggregate, in excess of any insurance coverage or other right of recovery or set-off against any third party, to the extent such right of recovery or set-off has been finally agreed to in a binding settlement or finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction without a right to appeal (such consideration, an "excess payment"), in settlement or payment of any or all damages, losses, liabilities, expenses or claims of any kind (including, without limitation, expenses of investigation and attorney's fees and expenses) ("damages") relating to, arising under or resulting from any action, suit or proceeding brought by any party other than a holder or purchaser of the series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock and relating to or arising out of a misstatement or alleged misstatement of a material fact, or omission or alleged omission of a material fact (including, without limitation, any claim pursuant to rule 10b-5 under the securities exchange act of 1934 or pursuant to any comparable state law or regulation) that relates to events or circumstances occurring in whole or in part on or prior to december 13, 2000 and was made in connection with the purchase of, failure to purchase, sale of, failure to sell, conversion of, failure to convert, redemption of, failure to redeem, exchange of or failure to exchange the corporation's or its affiliates' (or any of its or their predecessor or successor entity's) securities, such excess payment shall be deemed an issuance of stock for which the conversion ratio shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph 8(g)(ii) (regardless of whether the excess payment is actually paid in stock or is paid in cash or any other asset or security), and the aggregate consideration received by the corporation in connection with such issuance shall be deemed to be $0.00. any excess payment made in the form of cash or any other asset or security shall be treated for purposes of 17 the section 8(g)(ii) computation as a deemed issuance of stock in which the number of shares issued equals the quotient of the fair market value of the excess payment divided by the current valuation per common share. the adjustment of the conversion ratio pursuant to this section 8(g)(vi) shall be the sole remedy of a holder of series a preferred stock relating to an excess payment in respect of such series a preferred stock. (vii) for purposes of any computation under paragraphs 8(g)(ii), 8(g)(iii), 8(g)(iv), 8(g)(v) or 8(g)(vi) hereof, on any determination date, if the computation is being made with respect to any issuance of stock in connection with any agreement (including any amendment, modification or replacement thereof whenever made) (an "employee retention agreement") referred to in paragraph 7 of section 3.5(b) of the disclosure letter, or any substantially similar agreement (including any amendment, modification or replacement thereof) entered into by the corporation, its predecessors or successors or its or their respective affiliates on or prior to december 13, 2000, obligating the corporation to deliver common stock to any of the corporation's or its affiliates' (or any of its or their predecessor or successor entity's) current or former employees or consultants in respect of an agreement by such employee or consultant to remain in the employ of, or as a consultant to, the corporation following an acquisition transaction, then both the "trigger value" and the "current valuation per common share" shall be the greater of the 20 day market price and $4.00 (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization or the like) and the corporation will be deemed to have received aggregate consideration equal to the product of the number of shares of common stock issued and the market price. in the event that the corporation satisfies an obligation to deliver stock pursuant to an employee retention agreement by delivering cash or cash equivalents, and the corporation has sold stock (or any securities issuable upon conversion or exchange thereof)(other than the issuance by the corporation of the series a preferred stock or the series b preferred stock (or any securities issuable upon conversion or exchange thereof) or any issuance pursuant to a stock plan or an existing obligation) within the six months prior to the date of such cash delivery and as to which less than all of the proceeds have previously been applied pursuant to this section 8(g)(vii) then, to the extent of the proceeds of such offering(s) (the "substitute offering(s)") which have not previously been applied for purposes of this section (which shall be applied on a lifo 18 basis with the proceeds of the most recent offering being applied first), the corporation shall be deemed to have issued, in connection with such employee retention agreement, the number of shares of common stock in exchange for which the corporation received proceeds in an amount equal to the cash delivered pursuant to such employee retention agreement, and the conversion ratio will be adjusted for such issuance pursuant to this section 8(g)(vii) as if such adjustment had occurred at the time of the issuance by the corporation of such shares and no prior adjustment (if any) with respect to such issuance had occurred. if the conversion ratio had previously been adjusted as a consequence of such substitute offering, the adjustment of the conversion ratio under this section shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the adjustments shall not be duplicative. for purposes of any computation under paragraphs 8(g)(ii), 8(g)(iii), 8(g)(iv), 8(g)(v) or 8(g)(vi) hereof, on any determination date, if the computation is not being made with respect to any issuance of stock in connection with an employee retention agreement as provided above, the "current valuation per common share" shall be the greater of the 20 day market price and the adjusted conversion price, and the "trigger value" shall be the 20 day market price, and the aggregate consideration received by the corporation shall equal the fair market value of any consideration received by the corporation for such issuance. (viii) no adjustment to the conversion ratio pursuant to paragraphs 8(g)(ii), 8(g)(iii), 8(g)(iv) and 8(g)(v) above shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion ratio; provided however, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph 8(g)(viii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this paragraph 8(g) shall be made to the nearest four decimal points. (ix) in the event that, at any time as a result of the provisions of this paragraph 8(g), the holder of this series a preferred stock upon subsequent conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the corporation other than common stock, the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of this series a preferred stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions contained herein. 19 (h) all adjustments pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall be notified to the holders of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock and such notice shall be accompanied by a schedule of computations of the adjustments. (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the corporation shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of the series a preferred stock if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed that number of shares of common stock which the corporation may issue upon conversion of the series a preferred stock without breaching the corporation's obligations under the rules or regulations of the nasdaq stock market (the "exchange cap"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the corporation (a) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the nasdaq stock market (or any successor rule or regulation) for issuances of common stock in excess of such amount ("stockholder approval"), or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the corporation that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding (an "opinion"). until stockholder approval or an opinion is obtained, no holder of shares of series a preferred stock shall be issued, upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock, any shares of common stock which, together with all other shares of common stock issued prior thereto upon conversion of series a preferred stock, would exceed the exchange cap (such shares of common stock which would cause the exchange cap to be exceeded being hereinafter referred to as "excess shares"). to the extent any such holder submits any share of series a preferred stock (or portion thereof) for conversion into common stock pursuant to this section 8, which would, but for such limitation, cause the company to issue excess shares, the company shall immediately issue to such holder in exchange for such share of series a preferred, one share (or an equivalent portion thereof) of series b preferred stock, and the corporation shall promptly deliver to such holder a certificate representing all shares of series b preferred stock which are issued to such holder thereby. in the event that more than one holder of series a preferred stock submits shares of series a preferred stock for conversion on the same date and the corporation can convert some, but not all, of such shares of series a preferred stock, to the extent the company can convert such shares into common stock without exceeding the exchange cap, the company shall convert into common stock from each holder of preferred stock electing to have series a preferred stock converted at such time a pro rata amount of such holder's shares of series a preferred stock submitted for conversion based on the number of shares of series a preferred stock submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the total number of shares of series a preferred stock submitted for conversion on such date, and the remainder of such holder's shares of series a preferred stock submitted for conversion shall be exchanged for series b 20 preferred stock as provided in the preceding sentence. 9. voting rights. (a) except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock (i) shall be entitled to vote with the holders of the common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of common stock, (ii) shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of votes to which shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of series a preferred stock would have been entitled if such shares of common stock had been outstanding at the time of the applicable vote and related record date and (iii) shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the corporation. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, at any time before stockholder approval or an opinion is obtained, the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, plus any shares of common stock previously issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock, would represent greater than the number of votes that would be held by the number of shares of common stock constituting the exchange cap, then for voting purposes the number of votes per share of series a preferred stock shall be automatically reduced so that the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, plus any shares of common stock previously issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock, represent the number of votes that would be held by the number of shares of common stock constituting the exchange cap. (b) so long as any shares of series a preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the written consent or affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose of the holders of a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding, amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation, combination, reclassification or otherwise, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the corporation or of any provision thereof (including the adoption of a new provision thereof) which would result in an alteration or circumvention of the voting powers, designation and preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the series a preferred stock; provided that any such amendment or alteration that changes the dividend payable on, or the liquidation preference or the par value of, the series a preferred stock shall require the affirmative vote at a meeting of holders of series a preferred stock duly called for such purpose, or the written consent, of the holder of each share of series a preferred stock. (c) the corporation shall not, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of not less than a majority of the total number of shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding: 21 (i) issue any additional shares of series a preferred stock (other than as dividends on series a preferred stock or upon conversion of the series b preferred stock); (ii) authorize, create or issue shares of any class or series of stock having any preference or priority superior to or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the series a preferred stock; (iii) take any step resulting in the redemption of shares of parity securities or junior securities, except as set forth in paragraphs 4(c) and 4(d) of this certificate of designations; or (iv) amend this paragraph 9. (d) the consent or votes required in paragraph 9(b) and 9(c) above shall be in addition to any approval of stockholders of the corporation which may be required by law or pursuant to any provision of the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, which approval shall be obtained by vote of the stockholders of the corporation in the manner provided in paragraph 9(a) above. (e) on each of the issue date and the date of a stockholder approval event, if any, the number of directors then constituting the board of directors shall be increased by one and the holders of shares of series a preferred stock, voting as a single class, shall be entitled to elect one, or if a stockholder approval event has occurred, two directors to serve on the board of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the series a preferred stock called as hereinafter provided. whenever a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock issued on the issue date have been converted into common stock pursuant to this certificate of designation or have been transferred by the initial holder thereof to a person that is not an affiliate of the initial holder, then the right of the holders of the series a preferred stock to elect such additional director(s) shall cease, and the term of office of any person elected as director by the holders of the series a preferred stock shall forthwith terminate and the number of the board of directors shall be reduced accordingly. at any time after voting power to elect a director shall have become vested and be continuing in the holders of series a preferred stock pursuant to this paragraph, or if a vacancy shall exist in the office of a director elected by the holders of series a preferred stock, a proper officer of the corporation may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of at least twenty- five percent (25%) of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding addressed to the secretary of the corporation shall, call a special meeting of the holders of series a preferred stock, for the purpose of electing the director which such holders are entitled to elect. if such meeting shall 22 not be called by a proper officer of the corporation within twenty (20) days after personal service of said written request upon the secretary of the corporation, or within twenty (20) days after mailing the same within the united states by certified mail, addressed to the secretary of the corporation at its principal executive offices, then the holders of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the corporation, and such meeting may be called by the person so designated upon the notice required for the annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation and shall be held at the place for holding the annual meetings of stockholders. any holder of series a preferred stock so designated shall have, and the corporation shall provide, access to the lists of stockholders to be called pursuant to the provisions hereof. 10. reclassification, subdivision or combination. the series a preferred stock may not be reclassified, subdivided or combined unless the series b preferred stock is reclassified, subdivided or combined (as the case may be) simultaneously and in the same proportion. 11. reports. the corporation shall mail to all holders of series a preferred stock those reports, proxy statements and other materials that it mails to all of its holders of common stock. in the event the corporation is not required to file quarterly and annual financial reports with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the exchange act, the corporation will furnish the holders of the series a preferred stock with reports containing the same information as would be required in such reports. 12. quotation. so long as any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, the corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the quotation of the common stock on the nasdaq national market. 13. general provisions. (a) the headings of the paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses and subclauses of this certificate of designations are for convenience of reference only and shall not define, limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. (b) each holder of series a preferred stock, by acceptance thereof, acknowledges and agrees that payments of dividends, interest, premium and principal on, and exchange, redemption and repurchase of, such securities by the corporation are subject to restrictions on the corporation contained in certain credit and financing agreements. 23 in witness whereof, marchfirst, inc. has caused this certificate of designations to be signed and attested by the undersigned this 27th day of december, 2000. marchfirst, inc. by: /s/ robert f. bernard ----------------------------------- name: robert f. bernard title: chief executive officer attest: by: /s/ edward v. szofer ------------------------------- name: edward v. szofer title: secretary 24 ex-10.3 4 0004.txt exhibit 10.3 (conformed copy) certificate of designations, preferences and rights of series b 12% senior participating preferred stock of marchfirst, inc. pursuant to section 151 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware we, the undersigned, robert f. bernard, chief executive officer, and edward v. szofer, secretary, of marchfirst, inc., a delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of sections 103 and 151 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, do hereby make this certificate of designations and do hereby state and certify that pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the board of directors of the corporation by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the board of directors duly adopted the following resolutions: resolved, that, pursuant to article fourth of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (which authorizes 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value ("preferred stock")), the board of directors hereby fixes the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions, of a series of preferred stock. resolved, that each share of such series of preferred stock shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the following provisions: 1. number and designation. 375,000 shares of the preferred stock of the corporation shall be designated as series b 12% senior participating preferred stock (the "series b preferred stock"). 2. definitions. unless the context otherwise requires, when used herein the following terms shall have the meaning indicated.

(a) the holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to each share of series b preferred stock, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, dividends at a rate per annum equal to twelve percent (12%) of the liquidation preference per share, payable in accordance with the terms of this section 4, at the election of the corporation on or before each payment date, either (a) in cash or (b) in additional shares ("additional shares") of series b preferred stock. such dividends shall be cumulative from the issue date regardless of when actually paid (except that dividends on additional shares shall accrue pursuant to their terms from the date such additional shares are issued), whether or not in any dividend period (as defined below) or dividend periods there shall be funds of the corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends, and shall be payable semi- annually in arrears on june 30 and december 31 of each year (unless such day is not a business day, in which event such dividends shall be payable on the next succeeding business day) (each such date being a "dividend payment date" and each such semi-annual period being a "dividend period"). each such dividend shall be payable to the holders of record of shares of the series b preferred stock as they appear on the share register of the corporation on the corresponding record date. as used herein, the term "record date" means, with respect to the dividend payable on june 30 and december 31, respectively of each year, the preceding june 15 and december 15, or such other record date, not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the board of directors. accrued and unpaid dividends for any past dividend periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any dividend payment date, to holders of record on such record date, not more than 45 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the board of directors. (b) the amount of dividends payable for each full dividend period for the series b preferred stock shall be computed by dividing the annual twelve percent (12%) rate by two. the amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full dividend period, on the series b preferred stock shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the series b preferred stock that may be in arrears; provided that if dividends are not paid in full on any dividend payment date, dividends will cumulate as if the corporation elected to pay the unpaid dividends in cash and the liquidation preference had been increased by the amount of unpaid dividends until paid. (c) so long as any shares of the series b preferred stock are outstanding, no dividend, except as described in the next succeeding sentence, shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any parity securities, nor shall any parity securities be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the corporation, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for junior securities), unless in each case full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and consideration sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the series b preferred stock for all dividend periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment 5 of the dividend on such class or series of parity securities or the redemption, purchase or other acquisition thereof. when dividends are not paid in full or consideration sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all dividends declared upon shares of the series b preferred stock and all dividends declared upon any other class or series of parity securities shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid on the series b preferred stock and accumulated and unpaid on such parity securities. (d) so long as any shares of the series b preferred stock are outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or to effectuate a stock split on, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, junior securities) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or other distribution declared or made upon junior securities, nor shall any junior securities be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (other than a redemption, purchase or other acquisition of shares of common stock made for purposes of an employee incentive or benefit plan of the corporation or any subsidiary) (any such dividend, distribution, redemption or purchase being hereinafter referred to as a "junior securities distribution") for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the corporation, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for junior securities), unless in each case (i) the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock and accrued and unpaid dividends on any other parity securities shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past dividend periods with respect to the series b preferred stock and all past dividend periods with respect to such parity securities and (ii) sufficient consideration shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the dividend for the current dividend period with respect to the series b preferred stock and the current dividend period with respect to such parity securities. (e) if the corporation elects to pay dividends in additional shares, the number of additional shares to be issued as dividends will equal the cash amount of the dividend that would have been payable if dividends were paid in cash, divided by the initial liquidation preference. (f) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the making of any dividend or distribution to holders of common stock (including distributions of stock of the corporation or its subsidiaries other than dividends or distributions payable solely in common stock), the holder of each share of series b preferred stock on such record date shall be entitled to receive an equivalent dividend or distribution based on the number of shares of common stock into which one share of series a preferred stock is convertible on such record date. 5. liquidation preference. (a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of junior securities, the holders of the shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to each share of series b preferred stock an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders plus an amount in cash equal to the liquidation preference. if, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of series b 6 preferred stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any parity securities, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of shares of series b preferred stock and any such other parity securities ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares of series b preferred stock and any such other parity securities if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. (b) upon the completion of the distribution required by section 5(a) and any other distribution that may be required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come in to existence, the holders of series a preferred stock and the holders of series b preferred stock shall participate with the common stock ratably on an as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock) in the distribution of assets, or the proceeds thereof, until the holders of series b preferred stock shall have received (including amounts paid pursuant to section 5(a)) an aggregate of $1,500.00 per share of series b preferred stock (in each case as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like); thereafter, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, if assets remain in the corporation, the holders of the common stock of the corporation shall receive the distribution of assets, or the proceeds thereof, until such time as the holders of common stock shall have received, in the aggregate, distributions equal to their pro-rata percentage of the shares of the corporation as if the holders of series a preferred stock and the holders of series b preferred stock were participating with the common stock (and were not entitled to any preference thereto) on an as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock) beginning with the first dollar paid in such liquidation, disqualification or winding-up; thereafter, subject to the rights of any other series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, if assets remain in the corporation the holders of the common stock, the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock shall participate in the remaining distributions on as converted basis (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were converted at the same rate as series a preferred stock). (c) notwithstanding anything else in this certificate of designation, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation shall be deemed to have occurred upon (a) (i) the acquisition of the corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation, whether of the corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations or of any other corporation or corporations with or into the corporation, but excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the corporation); or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation; provided that a consolidation or merger as a result of which the holders of capital stock of the corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation possess (by reason of such holdings) 50% or more of the voting power of the corporation surviving such merger or consolidation (or other corporation which is the issuer of the capital stock into which the capital stock of the corporation is converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation) shall not be treated as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation within the meaning of this paragraph 5 or (b) a transaction or series of transactions in which a 7 person or group of persons (as defined in rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the exchange act) (excluding the initial holder of the series a preferred stock or any of its affiliates) acquires beneficial ownership (as determined in accordance with rule 13d-3 of the exchange act) of more than 50% of the common stock or the voting power of the corporation. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a deemed liquidation, dissolution or winding up pursuant to this section 5(c) as a result of a transaction in which substantially all of the consideration received by the corporation's stockholders is capital stock of the surviving corporation or the parent thereof (such issuer, the "new issuer"), if the board of directors of the surviving corporation determines that the payment of cash pursuant to section 5(a) would have a material adverse effect on the surviving corporation, the parent thereof, or the transaction, each holder of the series b preferred stock shall have the right to receive, in exchange for its shares of series b preferred stock and in lieu of payments otherwise payable pursuant to sections 5(a) and 5(b), at its election, either (x) capital stock in such amounts and in such form as would have been received had such holder converted all of its series b preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to such transaction (assuming that each share of series b preferred stock were convertible into common stock at the same rate as series a preferred stock) or (y) securities of the new issuer equivalent in rights and preferences to the series b preferred stock. 6. redemption. (a) the series b preferred stock shall not be redeemable by the corporation prior to the first call date. all shares of series b preferred stock shall be redeemable at the option of the corporation to the extent the corporation shall have funds legally available for such payment, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, (i) on and after the second call date, or, (ii) if the minimum call stock price test has been satisfied, on and after the first call date, at a redemption price per share equal to the greater of (i) the liquidation preference, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, and (ii) the market value on the redemption date of the number of shares of common stock into which one share of series a preferred stock is convertible on such date. (b) shares of series b preferred stock which have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the state of delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of preferred stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of the preferred stock; provided that no such issued and reacquired shares of series b preferred stock shall be reissued or sold as series b preferred stock. 7. procedure for redemption. (a) in the event that fewer than all the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the board of directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or pro rata (with any fractional shares being rounded to the nearest whole share) as may be determined by the board of directors. (b) in the event the corporation shall redeem shares of series b preferred stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock register of the corporation; provided that neither the failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall 8 affect the validity of the giving of notice for the redemption of any share of series b preferred stock to be redeemed except as to the holder to whom the corporation has failed to give said notice or except as to the holder whose notice was defective. each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date (which shall be a date on or after the first call date); (ii) the number of shares of series b preferred stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder (which if less than all the shares outstanding, must be on a pro-rate basis); (iii) the redemption price formula; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date. (c) notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the redemption date, dividends on the shares of series b preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the corporation (except the right to receive from the corporation the redemption price) shall cease. upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the board of directors of the corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the corporation at the redemption price as aforesaid. in case fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. 8. put rights. (a) the holders of the series b preferred stock shall have the right to put their shares to the corporation (the "put rights") only to the extent provided for in this paragraph 8. on or after the second put date, the put rights shall be exercisable on all shares of series b preferred stock. on or after the earlier to occur of (a) a change of control and (b) the first put sale date, but prior to the second put date, the put rights shall be exercisable for that number of shares of series b preferred stock equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of series b preferred stock that the corporation has issued plus the number it is then obligated to issue in the form of dividends on the series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock (the "total b shares"), times (y) the quotient of (i) the number of shares of series a preferred stock that have been converted into common stock plus the number of shares of series a preferred stock that have been sold or otherwise transferred by the initial holder thereof to a third party divided by (ii) the total number of shares of series a preferred stock that the corporation has issued plus the number it is then obligated to issue in the form of dividends on the series a preferred stock (the "total a shares"). if a change of control has not occurred, on or after the first put converted date but prior to the earlier to occur of (a) a change of control and (b) the first put sale date, the put rights shall be exercisable for that number of shares of series b preferred stock equal to the product of (i) the total b shares, times (y) the quotient of (i) the number of shares of series a preferred stock that have been converted into common stock divided by (ii) the total a shares. with respect to that number of shares of series b preferred stock for which put rights are exercisable as provided above in this paragraph 8, less the number of shares for which put rights have already been exercised (the "puttable shares"), the holders of the shares of series b preferred stock shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, at such holder's option, to put any or all such shares to the corporation. with respect to each share duly put to the corporation pursuant to this paragraph 8, the corporation shall pay an amount (the "put 9 consideration") equal to the market value on the date the put right is exercised of the number of common shares into which one share of series a preferred stock is convertible, (or would have been convertible had any series a preferred stock then been outstanding), as such number may have been adjusted, plus any amount of cash payable on such conversion for fractional shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, at the corporation's election, the corporation may pay the put consideration, in whole or in part, in the form of shares of common stock valued at the market price on the date the put rights are exercised. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any exercise of put rights that would require the corporation to pay in cash in excess of $25 million pursuant to this paragraph 8 in any 3-month period, in lieu of the cash portion of the put consideration constituting such excess (the "note amount"), the holder exercising such put rights shall at the election of the corporation, be issued a promissory note (a "note") by the corporation in the amount of the note amount if (i) federal or state law requires a vote of the stockholders of the corporation in order for the corporation to issue common shares in payment of the put consideration, (ii) stockholders of the corporation have voted in favor of issuing notes rather than common stock in connection with put right exercises and (iii) the board of directors of the corporation determines that the issuance of cash would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. any such note shall be secured to the fullest extent, and have the highest priority, permitted under the corporation's then existing debt instruments, shall have a two-year term, shall bear interest at the lesser of (i) the then applicable u.s. treasuries rate plus 850 basis points and (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable law, and shall be subject to documentation reasonably acceptable to holders of a majority of the series b preferred stock. notwithstanding any call for redemption pursuant to paragraph 6, the right to put shares so called for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the date immediately preceding the date fixed for such redemption unless the corporation shall default in making payment of the amount payable upon such redemption. with respect to each holder of series b preferred stock, the "holder share total" shall equal the number of shares of series b preferred stock that such holder currently holds (the "current share total") plus the number of shares of series b preferred stock that such holder has previously put pursuant to this paragraph 8 (the "prior put total"). each holder of series b preferred stock shall have the right to exercise put rights only with respect to (i) that proportion of its holder share total that equals the proportion of the number of shares of series b preferred stock for which put rights are exercisable as provided above in this paragraph 8 over the total b shares, less (ii) the prior put total. (b) (i) in order to exercise the put rights, the holder of the shares of series b preferred stock to be put shall surrender the certificate representing such shares at the office of the corporation, with a written notice of election to put completed and signed, specifying the number of shares to be put. unless the shares issuable on the put, if any, are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of series b preferred stock are registered, each share surrendered for the put shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder or the holder's duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax. 10 (ii) as promptly as practicable after the surrender by a holder of certificates for shares of series b preferred stock as aforesaid, the corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder, or on the holder's written order to the holder's transferee, (v) the cash portion of the put consideration, (w) a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of common stock issuable upon the put as part of the put consideration and (x) in the event of a put in part, a certificate or certificates for the whole number of shares of series b preferred stock not being put. (iii) each put shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the certificates for shares of series b preferred stock shall have been surrendered and such notice received by the corporation as aforesaid, and the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such put, if any, shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of common stock represented thereby at such time on such date. all shares of common stock delivered pursuant to this paragraph 8 will upon delivery be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights. upon the surrender of certificates representing shares of series b preferred stock, such shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares surrendered for the put shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the common stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph 8 and a certificate or certificates representing shares of series b preferred stock not put. (c) (i) upon delivery to the corporation by a holder of shares of series b preferred stock of a notice of election to put, the right of the corporation to redeem such shares of series b preferred stock shall terminate, regardless of whether a notice of redemption has been mailed as aforesaid. (d) prior to the delivery of any securities which the corporation shall elect to deliver upon the put of the series b preferred stock, the corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the corporation. (e) the corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock on the put of the series b preferred stock pursuant hereto; provided that the corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the series b preferred stock to be put and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. 9. conversion to series a preferred stock. if a stockholder approval event shall occur, each outstanding share of series b preferred stock, and fractions thereof, shall automatically and immediately convert, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of series a preferred 11 stock and (ii) any right to obtain any then accrued but unpaid dividends on each share of series b preferred stock shall automatically and immediately attach to the resulting converted share, provided that the dividend rate on the series b preferred stock shall be applicable and dividends will accrue at such rate until the date of such conversion. after such conversion, upon surrender to the corporation for cancellation of a certificate previously representing outstanding shares of series b preferred stock, together with instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the corporation, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the same number of shares of series a preferred stock as the number of shares of series b preferred stock previously represented by the surrendered certificate. until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate that, prior to the time of the conversion of the series b preferred stock into series a preferred stock (the "conversion time"), represented outstanding shares of series b preferred stock will be deemed from and after the conversion time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the same number of shares of series a preferred stock. 10. voting rights. (a) except as otherwise required by delaware law, the holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights. except as expressly required under delaware law, on any matter on which holders of shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to vote, they shall be entitled to one vote per share, voting as a single class. (b) so long as any shares of series b preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the written consent or affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose of the holders of a majority of the shares of series b preferred stock then outstanding, amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation, combination, reclassification or otherwise, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the corporation or of any provision thereof (including the adoption of a new provision thereof) which would result in an alteration or circumvention of the voting powers, designation and preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the series b preferred stock; provided that any such amendment or alteration that changes the dividend payable on, or the liquidation preference or the par value of, the series b preferred stock shall require the affirmative vote at a meeting of holders of series b preferred stock duly called for such purpose, or the written consent, of the holder of each share of series b preferred stock. (c) the corporation shall not, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of not less than a majority of the total number of shares of series b preferred stock then outstanding: (i) issue any additional shares of series b preferred stock (other than as dividends on series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock or in exchange for series a preferred stock pursuant to section 8(i) of the certificate of designations, preferences and rights of the series a preferred stock); (ii) authorize, create or issue shares of any class or series of stock having any preference or priority superior to or on a parity with any such preference or priority of the series b preferred stock; 12 (iii) take any step resulting in the redemption of shares of parity securities or junior securities, except as set forth in paragraphs 4(c) and 4(d) of this certificate of designations; or (iv) amend this paragraph 10. (d) the consent or votes required in paragraph 10(b) and 10(c) above shall be in addition to any approval of stockholders of the corporation which may be required by law or pursuant to any provision of the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

(a) (i) the holders of a majority in interest of the series a exchange shares that are registrable securities, collectively, may make up to two written requests for registration under the securities act of all or any part of the series a exchange shares held by such holders (the "series a demand registrations") and (ii) the holders of a majority in interest of the series b exchange shares that are registrable securities, collectively, may make up to two written requests for registration under the securities act of all or any part of the series b exchange shares held by such holders (the "series b demand registrations" and, together with the series a demand registrations, the "demand registrations"); provided that (a) if, in accordance with the terms of the series b certificate of designations, all outstanding shares of series b preferred are converted into shares of series a preferred, then the number of series b demand registrations shall be reduced by one and the remaining series b demand registration, if any, shall thereupon be converted into a series a demand registration, (b) no holder may request a demand registration prior to the nine-month anniversary of the closing date, (c) no demand registration may be requested within 180 days after the preceding request for a demand registration, and (d) each demand registration must be (1) in respect of registrable securities with a fair market value of at least $25,000,000 or (2) in respect of all remaining 2 series a exchange shares or series b exchange shares, as applicable, that are registrable securities and have a fair market value of at least $500,000. such request will specify the aggregate number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be sold and will also specify the intended method of disposition thereof. upon any such request, the issuer shall promptly give written notice of the requested registration at least 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date of the registration statement relating to such demand registration to each non-requesting holder. promptly after the expiration of such 15-day period, the issuer will notify all requesting holders of the identities of the other requesting holders and the number of shares of registrable securities requested to be included therein. at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating to such registration, the requesting holders may revoke such request, without liability to any of the other requesting holders, by providing a notice to the issuer revoking such request. (b) a demand registration shall not be deemed to have occurred unless the registration statement relating thereto (i) has become effective under the securities act and (ii) has remained effective for a period of at least 60 days, exclusive of any period referred to in (a) below (or such shorter period in which all registrable securities of the holders included in such registration have actually been sold thereunder). in addition, a demand registration shall not be deemed to have occurred if, after any registration statement requested pursuant to this section 2.01 becomes effective, (a) such registration statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court (other than such an event which occurs on no more than one occasion with respect to such registration statement and does not exceed a period of five business days) and (b) less than 75% of the registrable securities included in such registration statement has been sold thereunder. should a demand registration not become effective due to the failure of a holder to perform its obligations under this agreement, provided, however, that at such time the issuer is in compliance in all material respects with its obligations under this agreement, then such demand registration shall be deemed to have been effected; provided that if such failure to perform is due to a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or results of operations of the issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole that occurs subsequent to the date of the written request made by the requesting holders, then the demand registration shall not be deemed to have been effected. (c) in the event that the requesting holders withdraw or do not pursue a request for a demand registration and, pursuant to section 2.01(b) hereof, such demand registration is deemed to have been effected, the holders may reacquire such demand registration (such that the withdrawal or failure to pursue a request will not count as a demand registration hereunder) if the holders reimburse the issuer for any and all registration expenses (as defined in section 3.03) incurred by the issuer in connection with such request for a demand registration; provided that the right to reacquire a demand registration may be exercised a maximum of two times. (d) if the selling holders so elect, the offering of such registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering. a majority in interest of the selling holders shall have the right to select the managing underwriters and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with such offering, but 3 prior to making such selection shall consult with the issuer with respect thereto. in such event, the issuer will reasonably assist with such offering and will make members of senior management reasonably available to participate (but only at such times and to such extent as will not interfere with the performance of their duties to the issuer) in a customary "roadshow" at the selling holders' expense if the underwriters believe that such a roadshow would assist in an orderly distribution of the registrable securities. (e) the issuer will have the right to preempt any demand registration with a primary registration by delivering written notice (within five business days after the issuer has received a request for such demand registration) of such intention to the selling holders indicating that the issuer has identified a specific business need and use for the proceeds of the sale of such securities and the issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect a primary registration within 60 days of such notice. in the ensuing primary registration, the holders will have such piggyback registration rights as are set forth in section 2.02 hereof. upon the issuer's preemption of a requested demand registration, such requested registration will not count as a demand registration; provided that a demand registration will not be deemed preempted if the holders are permitted to sell all requested securities in connection with the ensuing primary offering by exercising their piggyback registration rights. the issuer may exercise the right to preempt only twice in any 360-day period; provided, that during any 360 day period there shall be two periods of at least 90 consecutive days each during which the selling holders may effect a demand registration. (f) subject to section 2.03, the issuer will be entitled to include in a demand registration shares of common stock for its own account or for the account of other persons. section 2.02. piggyback registration. if the issuer proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of common stock for its own account or for the account of another person (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or pursuant to rule 415 (or any substitute form or rule, respectively, that may be adopted by the commission)), the issuer shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders at the address set forth in the share register of the issuer as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event less than 10 days before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer each holder the opportunity to register on the same terms and conditions such number of shares of registrable securities as such holder may request (a "piggyback registration"). each holder will have five business days after receipt of any such notice to notify the issuer as to whether it wishes to participate in a piggyback registration; provided that should a holder fail to provide timely notice to the issuer, such holder will forfeit any rights to participate in the piggyback registration with respect to such proposed offering. in the event that the registration statement is filed on behalf of a person other than the issuer, the issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to have the shares of registrable securities that the holders wish to sell included in the registration statement. if the issuer shall determine in its sole discretion not to register or to delay the proposed offering, the issuer shall provide written notice of such determination to the holders and (i) in the case of a determination not to effect the proposed offering, shall thereupon be relieved of the obligation to register such registrable securities in connection therewith, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay a proposed offering, shall thereupon be permitted to delay registering such registrable securities for the same period as the delay in respect of the proposed 4 offering. as between the issuer and the selling holders, the issuer shall be entitled to select the underwriters in connection with any piggyback registration. section 2.03. reduction of offering. notwithstanding anything contained herein, if the managing underwriter of an offering described in section 2.01 or 2.02 states in writing that the size of the offering that holders, the issuer and any other persons intend to make is such that the inclusion of the registrable securities would be likely to materially and adversely affect the price, timing or distribution of the offering, then the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of holders shall be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter (the "maximum offering size"); provided that in the case of a piggyback registration, if securities are being offered for the account of persons other than the issuer, then the proportion by which the amount of registrable securities intended to be offered for the account of holders is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which the amount of securities intended to be offered for the account of such other persons (other than any person exercising a demand registration right or any person requesting to participate in such offering pursuant to that certain investor rights agreement, dated as of november 12, 1999, by and between the issuer and novell, inc. (the "novell investor rights agreement")) is reduced; provided further that in the case of a demand registration, the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of the holders making the demand registration shall be reduced only after the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the issuer and any other persons has been reduced to zero. in the event of a reduction pursuant to this section 2.03 of registrable securities to be offered for the account of holders, such reduction shall be pro rata among such holders based on the number of registrable securities each holder had proposed to sell. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the case of a piggyback registration, the amount of registrable securities to be offered by holders shall be subject to reduction to give full effect to the rights provided under the novell investor rights agreement, including, without limitation, section 2.5 thereof. section 2.04. preservation of rights. the issuer will not grant any registration rights to third parties which contravene the rights granted hereunder. article 3 registration procedures section 3.01. filings; information. in connection with a demand registration pursuant to section 2.01 hereof, the issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, the registration under the securities act of (i) all registrable securities for which the requesting holders have requested registration under section 2.01(a), and (ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in section 2.02 and 2.03, all other registrable securities that any holders with rights to request registration under section 2.01 have requested the issuer to register by request received by the issuer within 15 days after such holders receive the issuer's notice of the demand registration. in connection with any such request: 5 (a) the issuer will expeditiously prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the issuer then qualifies and which counsel for the issuer shall deem appropriate and available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become and remain effective for such period, not to exceed 60 days, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the sale of such securities; provided that if the issuer shall furnish to the requesting holders a certificate signed by the issuer's chairman, president or any vice-president stating that in his or her good faith judgment it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to the issuer or its stockholders for such a registration statement to be filed as expeditiously as possible (because the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or the disclosure of information in any related prospectus or prospectus supplement would materially interfere with any acquisition, financing or other material event or transaction which is then intended or the public disclosure of which at the time would be materially prejudicial to the issuer), the issuer may postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days on one occasion in any consecutive 360-day period; and provided further, that if (i) the effective date of any registration statement filed pursuant to a demand registration would otherwise be at least 45 calendar days, but fewer than 90 calendar days, after the end of the issuer's fiscal year, and (ii) the securities act requires the issuer to include audited financials as of the end of such fiscal year, the issuer may delay the effectiveness of such registration statement for such period as is reasonably necessary to include therein its audited financial statements for such fiscal year. (b) the issuer will, if requested, prior to filing such registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to the selling holders, and each applicable managing underwriter, if any, copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to the selling holders and each such underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration statement, amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as the selling holders or each such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities by the selling holders. (c) after the filing of the registration statement, the issuer will promptly notify the selling holders of any stop order issued or, to the issuer's knowledge, threatened to be issued by the commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. (d) the issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to qualify the registrable securities for offer and sale under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as the selling holders reasonably request; provided that the issuer will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph 3.01(d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction. (e) the issuer will as promptly as is practicable notify the selling holders, at any time when a prospectus relating to the sale of the registrable securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an underwriter or dealer, of the occurrence of any event or 6 prospective event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly make available to the selling holders, and to the underwriters any such supplement or amendment. upon receipt of any notice from the issuer of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in the preceding sentence, the selling holders will forthwith discontinue the offer and sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until receipt by the selling holders and the underwriters of the copies of such supplemented or amended prospectus and the selling holders will maintain the confidentiality of, and shall not disclose to any third party, any information contained in such notice or regarding the existence thereof, provided that the selling holders shall be permitted to disclose such information to their representatives, affiliates or others to whom they have a contractual obligation to disclose such information, in each case who agree to be bound by this confidentiality obligation. in the event the issuer shall give such notice, the issuer shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.01(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the issuer shall make available to the selling holders such supplemented or amended prospectus. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the issuer shall furnish to the selling holders a certificate signed by the issuer's chairman, president or any vice-president stating that in his or her good faith judgment it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to the issuer to promptly prepare, file and/or distribute a supplemented or amended prospectus because the disclosure of information in such prospectus amendment or supplement or sale of securities covered by the related registration statement would materially interfere with any acquisition, financing or other material event which is then intended or the public disclosure of which at the time would be materially prejudicial to the issuer, then the issuer shall be permitted to delay the preparation, filing and distribution of such amendment or supplement for a period of up to 30 days, provided that, in the case of a demand registration which has not been effective for at least 60 days and pursuant to which all the securities included therein have not been sold, if such delay exceeds a period of five business days, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities included in the demand registration may notify the issuer in writing during the delay period that the demand registration is being terminated, in which case the issuer shall not be obligated to amend or supplement the prospectus and, for purposes of section 2.01 such demand registration shall not be deemed to have occurred. (f) the issuer will enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities. (g) at the request of any underwriter in connection with an underwritten offering the issuer will furnish (i) an opinion of counsel, addressed to the underwriters, covering such customary matters as the managing underwriter may reasonably request and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the issuer's independent public accountants covering such customary matters as the managing underwriter may reasonably request. 7 (h) the issuer will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of 12 months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and the rules and regulations of the commission thereunder. (i) the issuer will use reasonable best efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange or quoted on each inter-dealer quotation system on which the common stock is then listed or quoted. section 3.02. selling holder information. the issuer may require selling holders promptly to furnish in writing to the issuer such information regarding such selling holders, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as the issuer may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required in connection with any demand registration or piggyback registration. section 3.03. registration expenses. in connection with any demand registration or piggyback registration, the issuer shall pay the following expenses incurred in connection with such registration (the "registration expenses"): (i) registration and filing fees with the commission and the national association of securities dealers, inc., (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the registrable securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing or quotation of the registrable securities, (v) fees and expenses of counsel to the issuer and the reasonable fees and expenses of independent certified public accountants for the issuer (including fees and expenses associated with the special audits or the delivery of comfort letters) and (vi) the reasonable fees and expenses of any additional experts retained by the issuer in connection with such registration. the selling holders shall pay (i) any underwriting fees, discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of registrable securities, (ii) fees and expenses of counsel for the selling holders, (iii) any transfer, stamp or similar taxes and (iv) any out-of-pocket expenses of the selling holders. article 4 indemnification and contribution section 4.01. indemnification by the issuer. the issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners, stockholders, members, employees, agents and representatives and each person (if any) which controls a selling holder within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by, arising out of, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if the issuer shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any 8 preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by or contained in or based upon any information furnished in writing to the issuer by or on behalf of such selling holder or any underwriter expressly for use therein or by the selling holder or underwriter's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the issuer has furnished the selling holder or underwriter with copies of the same. the issuer also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling holders provided in this section 4.01. section 4.02. indemnification by the selling holders. each selling holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the issuer, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, which controls the issuer within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the issuer to each selling holder, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each selling holder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the issuer provided in this section 4.02. section 4.03. conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.01 or section 4.02, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and, in the written opinion of counsel for the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties 9 from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. section 4.04. contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article 4 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities in respect of which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall to the fullest extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the issuer, a selling holder and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the issuer and each selling holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.04 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this article 4, no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and each selling holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds of the offering (before deducting expenses) received by such selling holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such selling holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article 5 miscellaneous section 5.01. notices. all notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier or similar writing) and shall be given to such 10 party at its address or telecopier number set forth on the signature page hereof or as provided below, or such other address or telecopier number as such party may hereinafter specify for the purpose to the party giving such notice. each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, when such telecopy is transmitted to the telecopy number specified pursuant to this section 5.01 and the appropriate confirmation is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this section 5.01. any person who becomes a holder shall provide its address and facsimile number to the issuer, which shall promptly provide such information to each other holder. section 5.02. no waivers; amendments. (a) no failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. (b) any provision of this agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by all the parties hereto. section 5.03. participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody arrangements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this agreement and (c) furnishes in writing to the issuer such information regarding such person, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as may be legally required in connection with such registration. section 5.04. rule 144. the issuer
