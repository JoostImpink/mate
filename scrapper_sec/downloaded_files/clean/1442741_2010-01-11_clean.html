virginia corporation (&#147;fbs&#148;), and xenith corporation, a virginia corporation (&#147;xenith&#148;), entered into an agreement of merger and a related plan of merger, dated as of may 12, 2009 and as amended by amendment no. 1, dated as of august 14, 2009, amendment no. 2, dated as of october 15, 2009, amendment no. 3, dated as of october 30, 2009, and amendment no. 4, dated as of november 19, 2009 (collectively, the &#147;merger agreement&#148;), providing for, among other things, the merger (the &#147;merger&#148;) of xenith with and into fbs, with fbs being the surviving entity in the merger. pursuant to terms of the merger agreement, one of the conditions to the completion of the merger was the completion by xenith of a private offering of its common stock resulting in gross proceeds available (which included both cash paid for shares of xenith common stock along with conversion of amounts advanced for pre-merger organizational expenses into shares of xenith common stock) to xenith at the effective time of the merger of not less than $40.0 million. on june 26, 2009, xenith sold an aggregate of 4,758,100 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to xenith corporation of $47.58 million. the shares were sold in a private placement pursuant to section 4(2) of the securities act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;securities act&#148;), and regulation d under the securities act on a best-efforts basis through certain of xenith&#146;s directors and executive officers who did not receive any commission or other compensation in connection with these activities. the reporting persons purchased an aggregate of 3,840,000 shares of common stock of xenith in its private placement. in addition, xenith granted the reporting persons an aggregate of 624,000 warrants and 214,000 options to purchase an equal number of shares of xenith common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share. the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on may 7, 2019. the options will become exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the completion of the merger and expire on may 7, 2019. each purchaser of shares of xenith common stock in its private offering was required to execute an investor rights agreement. pursuant to the terms of the investor rights agreement, dated as of june 26, 2009 (the &#147;original agreement&#148;), as amended by the first amendment thereto, dated as of december 21, 2009 (the &#147;first amendment&#148; and, collectively with the original agreement, the &#147;investor rights agreement&#148;), bankcap partners fund and its affiliates and all of the former directors and executive officers of xenith who became directors and executive officers of the issuer and who purchased shares of xenith in its private offering agreed to vote their shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock in favor of (1) one designee of bankcap partners fund for election to the issuer&#146;s board of directors for so long as bankcap partners fund or any of its affiliates is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, with respect to the issuer and (2) one additional designee of bankcap partners fund for election to the issuer&#146;s board of directors for so long as bankcap partners fund and its affiliates own 25% or more of the outstanding shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock. page 16 of 24 the investor rights agreement also provides that bankcap partners fund and any other holder of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of xenith common stock following completion of the xenith private offering will have certain rights to require the issuer to register for resale their shares of common stock under the securities act. all holders of xenith common stock who purchased in its private offering will have the right to participate in these registered resale offerings, subject to reduction with bankcap partners fund and the 20% holders having priority over other former xenith shareholders. the issuer assumed the rights and obligations of xenith under the investor rights agreement by operation of law at the effective time of the merger. the merger was effective on december 22, 2009. at the effective time of the merger, fbs amended its articles of incorporation to, among other things, change its name to xenith bankshares, inc. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each share of xenith common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive 0.8700 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock (the &#147;exchange ratio&#148;). based on the exchange ratio, an aggregate of 4,139,547 shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock were issued to the former shareholders of xenith in exchange for their shares of xenith common stock. an aggregate of 3,340,800 of those shares were issued to the reporting persons. all fractional shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock that a xenith shareholder would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the merger were aggregated and, if a fractional share resulted from such aggregation, such holder received, instead of the fractional share, an amount in cash equal to $9.23 multiplied by the fraction of a share of the issuer&#146;s common stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled. in addition, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the warrants and options to purchase shares of xenith common stock previously granted to the reporting person were converted into an aggregate of 542,800 warrants and 186,180 options to purchase an equal number of shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $11.49 per share based on the exchange ratio. the foregoing description of the merger agreement and the investor rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, reference to the merger agreement and the investor rights agreement, which are attached hereto as exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and exhibits 7 and 8, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction. xenith was originally envisioned to be a de novo virginia state bank, and was formerly known as xenith bank (in organization). however, with the dramatic changes in the banking landscape and capital markets in 2008 and continuing through 2009, xenith bank (in organization) modified its approach from attempting to open as a de novo bank to seeking an established banking partner. on may 5, 2009, xenith bank (in organization) amended its articles of incorporation to become xenith corporation. as noted in item 3, on may 12, 2009, xenith entered into the merger agreement with fbs. the reporting persons and their affiliates page 17 of 24 were
