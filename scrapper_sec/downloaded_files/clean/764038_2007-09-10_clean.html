item 4. purpose of transaction . &#160; (a)-(j) the purpose of scbt&#8217;s entering into the support agreements covering the shares to which this statement relates is to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of august 29, 2007, by and between scbt and tsb, attached hereto as exhibit e (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221;). except as otherwise provided in this statement, capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this statement have the meanings given such terms in the merger agreement. &#160; pursuant to instructions for cover page (2) to schedule 13d, the following is a description of the relationship among scbt and the shareholders under the support agreements, but is not an affirmation by scbt of the existence of a group for purpose of section 13(d)(3) or section 13(g)(3) of the act or rule 13d-5(b)(1) thereunder.&#160;&#160;pursuant to rule 13d-4 of the act, scbt disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares. &#160; in order to induce scbt to enter into the merger agreement, the shareholders entered into the support agreements with scbt. pursuant to the support agreements, each of the shareholders has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares for which such shareholder has sole voting authority, and to use his or her best efforts to cause to be voted all shares for which such shareholder has shared voting authority, in either case whether such shares were owned on which the support agreement was signed or are subsequently acquired: (a) for the approval of the merger agreement and the merger and (b) against any acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) other than the merger. &#160; &#160; each support agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement), and (ii) the date and time of termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. &#160; the merger agreement provides, among other things, for tsb to be merged with and into scbt (the &#8220;merger&#8221;). under the terms of the merger agreement, tsb shareholders will receive aggregate consideration of 939,372 shares of scbt common stock and $9.4 million in cash, including the cash-out value of tsb&#8217;s stock options.&#160;&#160;the stock portion of the consideration is based upon a fixed exchange ratio of 0.993 shares of scbt common stock for each of the outstanding shares of tsb common stock, which as of june 30, 2007 totaled 1,113,037 shares.&#160;&#160;holders of the issued and outstanding common stock of tsb will have the right to receive either $35.00 in cash per share, or scbt common stock, or a combination thereof subject to the overall limits set forth above. &#160; the merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization to scbt and tsb and otherwise tax free to tsb&#8217;s shareholders, except to the extent they receive cash, and is to be accounted for as a purchase. consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including: (i) receipt of the approval of tsb&#8217;s shareholders; (ii) receipt of requisite regulatory approvals; (iii) receipt of legal opinions as to the tax treatment of the merger; (iv) listing on the nasdaq global select market, subject to notice of issuance, of scbt&#8217;s common stock to be issued in the merger; and (v) satisfaction of certain other conditions. &#160; after the effective time of the merger, scbt may take any one or more of the other actions described in the instructions to item 4 of schedule 13d. &#160; the foregoing descriptions of the transactions contemplated by the support agreements and the merger agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the respective agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits b through n, respectively. exhibits b through n are specifically incorporated herein by reference in answer to this item 4. &#160; except as set forth in this statement, the support agreements and the merger agreement, neither scbt nor, to its knowledge, any of the individuals named in exhibit a hereto, has any plans or proposals that relate to or that would result in or relate to any of the actions specified in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. &#160; item 5. interest in securities of the issuer . &#160; (a)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;as a result of the support agreements, scbt may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of an aggregate of 179,659 shares of tsb&#8217;s common stock, which constitute, based on information set forth in tsb&#8217;s form 10-q for the fiscal period ended june 30, 2007, approximately 16.1% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of tsb.&#160;&#160;scbt, however, hereby disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares, and this statement shall not be construed as an admission that scbt, for any or all purposes, is the beneficial owner of the shares. for purposes of this statement, scbt has excluded 106,382 shares purchasable by the shareholders within 60 days pursuant to options, which shares would become subject to the support agreements if such options are exercised.&#160;&#160;such shares have been excluded because scbt does not have the right to control whether or not any shareholder exercises any of his or her options. &#160; &#160; other than as provided above, neither scbt nor, to its knowledge, any of the persons listed on exhibit a hereto owns or has any right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of tsb&#8217;s common stock. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;pursuant to the support agreements, scbt may be deemed to have shared power to vote (i) 62,876 shares with william b. allen, (ii) 15,701 shares with james h. barnhardt, jr. (5,452 shares of which are held by mr. barnhardt with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (iii) 9,256 shares with william b. barnhardt (877 shares of which are held by mr. barnhardt with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (iv) 4,173 shares with amy rice blumenthal (1,830 shares of which are held by ms. blumenthal with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (v) 9,150 shares with p. w. davis, iii, (vi) 2,343 shares with jubal a early (all of which are held by mr. early with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (vii) 2,928 shares with herbert l. harriss (all of which are held by mr. harriss with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (viii) 2,197 shares with william states lee, iv, (ix) 3,441 shares with donald j. sherrill (1,097 shares of which are held by mr. sherrill with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (x) 22,808 shares with marc h. silverman (3,660 shares of which are held by mr. silverman with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), (xi) 39,457 shares with john b. stedman, jr. (3,403 shares of which are held by mr. stedman with shared voting authority with one or more third parties), and (xii) 5,329 shares with david j. zimmerman (4,414 shares of which are held by mr. zimmerman with shared voting authority with one or more third parties).&#160;&#160;scbt, however, (i) is not entitled to any rights as a shareholder of tsb as to the shares and (ii) disclaims any beneficial ownership of the shares.&#160;&#160;the foregoing share numbers exclude 106,382 shares purchasable by the shareholders within 60 days pursuant to options, which shares would become subject to the support agreements if such options are exercised. such shares have been excluded because scbt does not have the right to control whether or not any shareholder exercises any of his or her options. &#160; the foregoing information regarding the shares was provided, with respect to each shareholder, by such shareholder in his or her support agreement.&#160;&#160;the item 2 information relating to the shareholders set forth in exhibit o consists of information contained in the definitive proxy statement for tsb&#8217;s 2007 annual meeting of shareholders.&#160;&#160;while scbt has no reason to believe that such information was not reliable as of its date, scbt only accepts responsibility for accurately reproducing such information and accepts no further or other responsibility for such information. in addition, scbt makes no representation or warranty with respect to the accuracy or completeness of such information or any representation or warranty, and the filing of this statement shall not create any implication under any circumstances that there have been no events, or that there is no other information, including events or information not yet publicly disclosed by any of the shareholders, which may affect the accuracy or completeness of such information. &#160;
