provided, however, that diana will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, damage, liability, cost or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by sattel, such underwriter or such controlling person in writing specifically for use in the preparation thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, damage, liability, cost or expense purchased diana shares, or any persons controlling such underwriter, if a copy of the prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if diana shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of diana shares to such person and if the prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, damage, liability, cost or expense. (b) sattel will indemnify and hold harmless diana, its directors and officers, any controlling person and any underwriter from and against, and will reimburse diana, its directors and officers, any controlling person and any underwriter with respect to, any and all loss, damage, liability, cost or expense to which diana or any controlling person and/or any underwriter may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses are caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement, any prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was so made in reliance upon written information furnished by sattel specifically for use in the preparation thereof. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph 4 of notice of the commencement of any action involving the subject matter of the foregoing indemnity provisions such indemnified party will, if a claim thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions of said paragraph (a) or (b), promptly notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than hereunder. in case such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, provided, however, if the defendants in any action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and if there is a conflict of interest which would prevent counsel for the indemnifying party from also representing the indemnified party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties, but in no event shall the indemnifying parties be responsible for more than one such additional firm for all indemnified parties. after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of said paragraph (a) or (b) for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed counsel in accordance with the proviso of the preceding sentence, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after the notice of the commencement of the action, or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this paragraph 4 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) above, in such proportion as is in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of diana, the selling stockholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by diana, the selling stockholders or the underwriters and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. diana, the selling stockholders and the underwriters shall agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d). the amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this paragraph (d). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5. sattel cooperation. diana may require sattel to furnish diana in a timely manner such information with respect to sattel and the distribution of diana stock as diana may from time to time reasonably request. in connection with the registration of diana stock, sattel will (a) cooperate with diana and the underwriter, if any, in preparing the registration statement, (b) promptly supply diana and the underwriter with all information and documents as the underwriter or diana may deem reasonably necessary, (c) discontinue sales of diana stock upon notification of any stop order or suspension of the effectiveness of the registration statement, (d) notify diana immediately upon any change in the plan of distribution or other information concerning sattel described in the prospectus, (e) discontinue use of any prospectus following notification by diana that the prospectus must be amended or supplemented, (f) comply with the applicable requirements of rules 10b-5 and 10b-6 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, (g) not use any prospectus other than the most recent prospectus included in the registration statement, and (h) otherwise comply with the prospectus delivery requirements under the securities act. 6. defined terms. terms with initial capital letters not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the exchange agreement to which these registration rights are an exhibit. 7. assignment. sattel92s rights under this agreement may be assigned, in whole or in part, to any subsequent transferee of sattel 92s diana shares, including, without limitation, any pledgee of such diana shares. 8. notices. all notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon delivery if delivered personally, twenty-four (24) hours after transmission by telecopy with answerback, 12:00 p.m. (noon) of the next business day after being sent via overnight courier, and five (5) days after being mailed, certified return receipt requested. actual notice, however given, shall always be effective. -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
