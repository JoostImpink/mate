sale recommendation acceptance period &#8221;). if one or more members accepts such sale recommendation, the managing member in its discretion shall dispose of such members&#8217; consortium percentage interests of the investment and other assets of the consortium in the manner set forth in the sale recommendation or by such other means of maximizing value as the managing member may determine, including, without limitation, through an en bloc sale or other orderly disposition (it being understood that the proceeds from such sale distributable to each such member shall be reduced by such member&#8217;s consortium percentage interest of the liabilities of the consortium, such member&#8217;s company percentage interest of any company-specific liabilities (as determined in accordance with section&#160;4.12(c) ) and the member&#8217;s proportionate share (determined by dividing such member&#8217;s invested capital by the aggregate sum of the invested capital of all the consortium members participating in the sale recommendation) of the costs incurred in connection with the disposition of such portion of the investment and other assets of the consortium, as determined by the independent accounting firm as of the date such portion of the investment and other assets of the consortium are sold). at any time following the sale recommendation acceptance period, a member that did not accept the sale recommendation may nonetheless request that its pro rata share (determined in accordance with its consortium percentage interest) of the investment and other assets of the consortium be sold by the consortium and the proceeds distributed (it being understood that the proceeds from such sale distributable to each such member shall be reduced by such member&#8217;s consortium percentage interest of the liabilities of the consortium, such member&#8217;s company percentage interest of any company-specific liabilities (as determined in accordance with section&#160;4.12(c) ) and the member&#8217;s proportionate share (determined by dividing such member&#8217;s invested capital by the aggregate sum of the invested capital of all the consortium members participating in the sale recommendation) of the costs incurred in connection with the disposition of such portion of the investment and other assets of the consortium, as determined by the independent accounting firm as of the date such portion of the investment and other assets of the consortium are sold). in the event that such request is made prior to completion of the disposition being made pursuant to the sale recommendation, the managing member will endeavor to cause such pro rata share to be included in the en bloc sale being made pursuant to the sale recommendation, and otherwise will seek to sell such pro rata share of the investment and other assets of the consortium in the market or otherwise in a manner that seeks to maximize value. &#160; &#160; 73 &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in connection with any sale recommendation, and solely for the purpose of sections&#160;6.1(b) , 6.1(d) and 6.1(e) hereof, the entire investment and other assets of the consortium will be deemed to be disposed of and the proceeds distributed as follows: (x) in the event any member accepts the sale recommendation within the sale recommendation acceptance period, such distribution shall be based on the price received under such disposition and taking into account the liabilities of the consortium, such member&#8217;s company percentage interest of any company-specific liabilities (as determined in accordance with section&#160;4.12(c) ) and the costs reasonably expected to be incurred on a disposition of the investment and other assets of the consortium, in each case as determined by the independent accounting firm, and (y) in the event the sale recommendation is not accepted by any member within the sale recommendation acceptance period, such distribution shall be based on the deemed disposition of the investment and other assets of the consortium at the then-current fair market value, taking into account the liabilities of the consortium, such member&#8217;s company percentage interest of any company-specific liabilities (as determined in accordance with section&#160;4.12(c) ) and the costs reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with a disposition of the investment and other assets of the consortium, in each case as determined by the independent accounting firm. &#160;

&#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;within seven (7) days of the date of deemed receipt of the sale notice, each acquiring member may elect by notice to the company and the disposing member (the &#8220;

partially adjusted exit price &#8221;) and (y) the transaction distribution amount and the carried interest attributable to such portion of the subject interest determined based on the partially adjusted exit price (it being understood that the acquisition of the subject interest by the acquiring members shall have no effect on the transaction distribution amount and the carried interest, if any, distributable to the managing member and the class b member, respectively, in respect the subject interest after the date of acquisition thereof by the acquiring members), in each case determined by the independent accounting firm; &#160; (f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the aggregate amount of interests under the acquisition notices is in excess of the subject interest, the subject interest which each acquiring member providing an acquisition notice shall acquire shall be determined by allocating the subject interest among the acquiring members as follows: (1) first, to each acquiring member the lesser of (a) the portion of the subject interests indicated in its acquisition notice to the extent it has not been allocated to such acquiring member on a previous application of this section&#160; 10.8(d)(ii) (f)(1) and (b) its pro rata share (determined based on such acquiring member&#8217;s commitment as a proportion of the aggregate commitments of all acquiring members providing an acquisition notice) of the subject interest which has not been allocated on a previous application of this section&#160; 10.8(d)(ii) (f)(1) ; and (2) second, by repeating the allocation process in section&#160; 10.8(d)(ii) (f)(1) until all of the subject interest has been allocated; and &#160; (g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the aggregate amount of interests under the acquisition notices is less than the entire subject interest, then the disposing member may elect to withdraw the sale offer or elect to have the company dispose of the disposing member&#8217;s remaining share of the investment and other assets of the company, the proceeds of which shall be subject to reduction by a reasonable estimate of the disposing member&#8217;s remaining share of all of the company&#8217;s liabilities and the costs incurred in connection with the disposition of such remaining share of the investment and other assets of the company, in each case as determined by the independent accounting firm. &#160;

12.14 shall be referred by any such party to, and shall be finally settled by, arbitration under and in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce (the &#8220; rules &#8221;).&#160;&#160;a dispute shall be deemed to have arisen when a relevant party (or parties) gives notice to the other to that effect, pursuant to section&#160; 12.1 hereof.&#160;&#160;the place of arbitration shall be london, united kingdom, and shall be conducted in the english language.&#160;&#160;the decision or award of three (3) arbitrators, appointed in accordance with the rules and in accordance with the requirements following in this section&#160; 12.14 , shall be in writing and is final and binding on the relevant parties.&#160;&#160;each of the three (3) arbitrators shall be an attorney with at least ten (10) years of practice (at least five (5) of which must be predominately in the areas of corporate law) and who has served as an arbitrator in at least five (5) international chamber of commerce arbitrations.&#160;&#160;the arbitration panel shall award the prevailing party (or parties) its attorneys&#8217; fees and costs, arbitration administrative fees, panel member fees and costs, and any other costs associated with the arbitration, proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of any arbitral award and the costs and attorney&#8217;s fees involved in the recognition and enforcement proceedings.&#160;&#160;the parties further agree that (i) attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with the successful recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award shall always be paid by the non-enforcing party (or parties) and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this section&#160; 12.14 to the contrary and without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, the parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court identified in section&#160; 12.15 hereof for the purpose of any proceeding for recognition and enforcement of both the arbitral award and the parties&#8217; agreement as to costs of that proceeding in accordance with this section&#160; 12.14 .&#160;&#160;the arbitration panel may only award damages as provided for under the terms of this agreement and in no event may punitive, consequential and special damages be awarded.&#160;&#160;in the event of any conflict between the rules and any provision of this agreement, this agreement shall govern.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything in this section&#160; 12.14 to the contrary, any party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court identified in section&#160; 12.15 hereof to seek interim provisional or injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved or to enforce an arbitration decision or award. &#160; notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, this section&#160; 12.14 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the state of delaware, including the uniform arbitration act (10 del. c. &#167;&#160;5701 et&#160;seq. ) (the &#8220; delaware arbitration act &#8221;).&#160;&#160;if, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this section&#160; 12.14 , including the rules, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the delaware arbitration act, or other applicable law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this section&#160; 12.14 .&#160;&#160;in that case, this section&#160; 12.14 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the delaware arbitration act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this section&#160; 12.14 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision, but for the avoidance of doubt, the parties have no desire to have the delaware arbitration act apply to this agreement. &#160;

(c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each of the members hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection or defense which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue to any such action, suit or proceeding in the united states district court for the district of delaware (or if jurisdiction is not available in such court, then in the state court of delaware sitting in wilmington) and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. &#160; 12.16 remedies and waivers .&#160;&#160;no delay or omission on the part of any party to this agreement in exercising any right, power or remedy provided by law or provided hereunder shall impair such right, power or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof.&#160;&#160;the single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by law or provided hereunder shall not preclude any other or further exercise of any other right, power or remedy.&#160;&#160;the rights, powers and remedies provided hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights, powers and remedies provided by law. &#160;

notional interest &#8221;).&#160; for the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by an additional limited partner in respect of notional interest shall not be deemed a capital contribution for the purposes hereof and shall not reduce the available commitment of such additional limited partner. &#160;

(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(i) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;except as required by the act or other applicable law, no partner, in its capacity as such, shall be required to repay to the partnership, any other partner or any creditor of the partnership all or any part of the distributions made to such partner pursuant hereto.&#160;

(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;any amount returned by a partner pursuant to this section&#160;3.5(b) shall be treated as a contribution of capital to the partnership (but not as a capital contribution for purposes hereof) and shall be treated as if such returned amount was not previously distributed to such partner. &#160;

26 &#160; (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;at any time that the general partner requires a partner to return distributions under this section&#160;3.5(b) for the purpose of meeting such partner&#8217;s pro rata share of indemnity obligations under section&#160;9.2 hereof, the class b limited partner and the class c partner shall return a portion of any carried interest and transaction distribution amount that the class b limited partner or class c partner, as the case may be, received in respect of such other partner equal to (a) the amount of such carried interest and transaction distribution amount received by the class b limited partner or class c partner, as the case may be, less (b) the carried interest and transaction distribution amount, if any, that the class b limited partner or class c partner, as the case may be, would have received, if any, in respect of such other partner, if the amounts payable by such other partner under this section&#160;3.5(b) (but for this section&#160;3.5(b)(v) had been paid by the partnership and not distributed to such other partner and the class b limited partner or class c partner, as the case may be. &#160;

each tier one parallel investment vehicle shall act at the direction of its board of directors, as set forth in further detail in section&#160;4.1(c) .&#160; &#160; 29 &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the partners hereby agree that the board of directors shall direct the general partner to cause the partnership to enter into the voting agreement on or about the date hereof and that, notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the partnership shall be bound by the result of any vote, consent, approval or determination made in accordance with the voting agreement, regardless of whether the partnership participated in or was in favor of or against any such vote, consent, approval or determination, and the general partner is hereby directed to cause the partnership to act in accordance therewith.&#160; each parallel investment vehicle shall be a party to such voting agreement and be bound to act in accordance with the decisions made thereunder in the same manner as the partnership.&#160; if, for any reason, a parallel investment vehicle is not a party to the voting agreement either because it was established after the date such voting agreement was executed or for any other reason whatsoever, then the managing member, general partner or manager (or equivalent) of such parallel investment vehicle (acting at the direction of the board of directors (or equivalent) of such parallel investment vehicle) shall cause such parallel investment vehicle to execute a joinder to the voting agreement and thereby be bound to act in accordance with the decisions made thereunder in the same manner as the partnership. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if and for so long as the partnership is a tier one parallel investment vehicle, the decision as to how the general partner shall cause the partnership to act under the voting agreement with respect to any tier one action shall be vested exclusively in the board of directors acting in accordance with the voting agreement.&#160; no individual member of the board of directors, in its capacity as such, shall have any authority or power to act for or on behalf of the partnership or to take any action or do any thing that would be binding on the partnership, or to make any expenditures or to incur any indebtedness in the name or on behalf of the partnership.&#160;

if more than one consortium member is entitled, in accordance with section&#160;4.3(a) , to appoint an individual to the board of directors of any tier one parallel investment vehicle and to thereby cause such tier one parallel investment vehicle to act at its direction under the voting agreement, then each such consortium member shall cause the tier one parallel investment vehicle to act only with respect to its respective consortium percentage interest.&#160; for example, if two consortium members each hold a fifteen percent (15%) consortium percentage interest, then the individual appointed to the board of directors by each such consortium member shall direct the tier one parallel investment vehicle how to vote a fifteen percent (15%) consortium percentage interest under the voting agreement, such that the tier one parallel investment vehicle may vote a fifteen percent (15%) consortium percentage interest in favor of such matter and a fifteen percent (15%) consortium percentage interest against such matter. &#160;

affiliate transaction &#8221;), subject, in each case, to approval of such affiliate transaction by a super-majority vote of members on a consortium-wide basis (other than the general partner and its affiliates, including any person or account the interest of which is managed by brookfield on a discretionary basis).&#160; the terms on which affiliate transactions relating to the partnership are entered into must be on terms no less favorable to the partnership than would reasonably be expected to be obtained in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation between unaffiliated parties (including, but not limited to, fees, termination rights, required service levels and default provisions).&#160; the terms on which affiliate transactions relating to ggp are entered into must be on terms no less favorable to ggp than would reasonably be expected to be obtained in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation between unaffiliated parties as to fees and otherwise consistent with industry standards.&#160; in either case, any such fees will be disclosed to the consortium members on a quarterly basis.&#160; for the avoidance of doubt, any fees paid to the general partner or its affiliates in respect of an affiliate transaction will not be applied to reduce the amounts payable to the general partner under section&#160;6.1 hereof. &#160;

ggp financing vehicle &#8221;) by selling interests therein (the &#8220; ggp financing interests &#8221;) pursuant to the terms on this section&#160;5.2 . &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the general partner has established a ggp financing vehicle, each consortium member shall have the right (but not the obligation) to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as all other equity owners of the ggp financing vehicle, up to a percentage of the ggp financing interests equal to such ggp financing member&#8217;s ggp financing allocation percentage (each such consortium member that exercises such right, a &#8220; ggp financing member &#8221;).&#160; the ggp financing vehicle shall be on such terms and conditions as the ggp financing members shall agree in good faith, but for the avoidance of doubt, shall not provide for any carried interest or transaction distribution amount or similar fees or payments. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if, after the sale (if any) of ggp financing interests pursuant to section&#160;5.2(b) hereof, less than 100% of the ggp financing interests have been purchased by ggp financing members, each ggp financing member purchasing ggp financing interests pursuant to section&#160;5.2(b) hereof (the &#8220; participating ggp financing members &#8221;) shall have the right (but not the obligation) to purchase up to a percentage of any ggp financing interests not sold to participating ggp financing members equal to such participating ggp financing member&#8217;s remaining ggp financing percentage. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if, after the sale (if any) of ggp financing interests pursuant to section&#160;5.2(c) hereof, less than 100% of the ggp financing interests have been purchased by ggp financing members, the ggp financing vehicle shall have the right (but not the obligation) to sell any remaining ggp financing interests to any person.&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, no ggp financing interests sold pursuant to this section&#160;5.2(d) may be sold for an amount less than the price at which such ggp financing interests were offered to the ggp financing members pursuant to section&#160;5.2(b) or 5.2(c) hereof. &#160;

(g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if (i) approval by a super-majority vote of members is not obtained pursuant to section&#160;5.2(a) hereof, (ii) the partnership or any parallel investment vehicle holds pre-emptive rights in respect of the applicable ggp financing or such financing is pursuant to a rights offering and (iii) such pre-emptive rights or rights are non-transferable, within five (5) business days following the date the vote was held pursuant to section&#160;5.2(a) hereof, each consortium member that elected to receive such non-transferable pre-emptive rights or rights (each, an &#8220; electing member &#8221;) may notify the general partner of the portion of such pre-emptive rights or rights that such electing member desires the partnership or such parallel investment vehicle to exercise on its behalf.&#160;&#160;if a consortium member fails to so notify the general partner within such period, such consortium member shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such consortium member&#8217;s rights under this section&#160;5.2(g) . if the aggregate pre-emptive rights or rights that all electing members have requested that the partnership or such parallel investment vehicle exercise on their behalf exceeds the aggregate pre-emptive rights or rights available to be exercised, the pre-emptive rights or rights to be exercised by the partnership or such parallel investment vehicle on behalf of the electing members shall be allocated among the electing members as follows: (1) first, to each electing member the lesser of (a) the portion of such pre-emptive rights or rights that such electing member desires the partnership or such parallel investment vehicle to exercise on its behalf to the extent it has not been allocated to such electing member on a previous application of this section&#160;5.2(g)(1) and (b) its pro rata share (determined based on such electing member&#8217;s invested capital as a proportion of the aggregate invested capital of all electing members) of the pre-emptive rights or rights which have not been allocated on a previous application of this section&#160;5.2(g)(1) ; and (2) second, by repeating the allocation process in section&#160;5.2(g)(1) until all of the pre-emptive rights or rights to be exercised by the partnership or such parallel investment vehicle on behalf of the electing members have been allocated. promptly following allocation of the pre-emptive rights or rights among the electing members, the general partner shall by written notice to each electing member call a special capital contribution (which shall not constitute a capital contribution for the purposes of this agreement or the parallel vehicle agreements) from each electing member in an amount required to exercise such electing member&#8217;s pro rata share (determined based on such electing member&#8217;s invested capital as a proportion of the aggregate invested capital of all electing members) of the pre-emptive rights or rights and all costs and expenses related thereto. promptly following receipt of such special capital contribution, the general partner, on behalf of the electing members (and not on behalf of all consortium members), shall exercise the pre-emptive rights or rights and shall promptly distribute the interests in ggp acquired through the exercise of such pre-emptive rights or rights to each electing member in accordance with its pro rata share (determined based on such electing member&#8217;s invested capital as a proportion of the aggregate invested capital of all electing members). notwithstanding anything contained in this agreement to the contrary, such interests in ggp shall not constitute investment proceeds and shall not be distributed in accordance with article 6 hereof. &#160;
