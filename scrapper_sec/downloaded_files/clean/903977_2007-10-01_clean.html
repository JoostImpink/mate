(2) rm and rm sub shall, collectively, be responsible for only an amount (the &#147;indemnified percentage&#148; ) equal to (x) 42 percent, until the total amount of liabilities for which rm and/or rm sub would be liable in part exceeds the aggregate amount of dividends and/or reductions in capital actually paid by newco from the date hereof until the end date, and (y) 50 percent, thereafter, of the liabilities. rm and rm sub shall not be responsible under section 3.8 for any liabilities until the aggregate amount of liabilities for which rm and rm sub would be liable, but for this sentence, exceeds the fair market value, at the end date, of all assets of newco, newco i.5 and newco ii at the end date (other than direct or indirect ownership of shares in the capital of magna), and then only for the indemnified percentage of the excess. (3) in the event that a party (the &#147;indemnified party&#148; ) shall become aware of any claim, proceeding or other matter (a &#147;claim&#148; ) in respect of which another party to this agreement (the &#147;indemnifying party&#148; ) agreed to indemnify the indemnified party pursuant to this agreement, the indemnified party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the indemnifying party. if, through the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party does not receive notice of any claim in time to contest effectively the determination of any liability susceptible of being contested, the indemnifying - 39 - party shall be entitled to set off against the amount claimed by the indemnified party the amount of any liabilities incurred by the indemnifying party resulting from the indemnified party&#146;s failure to give such notice on a timely basis.

(5) the indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified party all amounts for which the indemnifying party is liable pursuant to this section 3.8 promptly after the indemnified party incurs the liability in respect of which such liability arises. the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall co-operate fully with each other with respect to claims, and shall keep each other fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available). (6) the rights of newco i.5 and newco ii to indemnity under this section 3.8 shall terminate upon such person becoming a subsidiary of, or having merged into or amalgamated or combined with, magna or a corporation controlled directly or indirectly by magna (without limiting the rights of newco ii under section 8.1 of the exchange agreement). - 40 - (7) 445, newco, rm and rm sub acknowledge that, as between 445 and newco, on the one hand, and rm and rm sub, on the other hand, the amounts if any arising under section 8.1(c) of the exchange agreement shall be allocated: (x) 100 percent minus the indemnified percentage to 445 and newco and (y) the indemnified percentage to rm and rm sub; and 445 and newco, collectively, shall be responsible for and contribute to 100 percent minus the indemnified percentage of such amounts, and rm and rm sub, collectively, shall be responsible and contribute to the indemnified percentage of such amounts. (8) the limitations in this section 3.8 do not limit the rights and remedies of any person for a violation by any other person of any other provision of any transaction agreement. (9) the obligations of rm and rm sub under this section 3.8 shall survive termination of this agreement and shall survive (a) with respect to tax liabilities, until the date that is 60 days after the expiration of the time within which such taxes may be assessed, reassessed, levied or otherwise charged or claimed by the relevant governmental entity, and (b) with respect to all other liabilities, two years following the end date, except, in either case, for liabilities with respect to which a claim for indemnification under this section 3.8 shall have been made prior to such date. article 4 representations and warranties section 4.1 representations and warranties of the investors. each investor represents and warrants to and in favour of the other parties as follows and acknowledges that the other parties are relying on such representations and warranties in entering into this agreement: (a) existence. it is a corporation validly incorporated and existing under the laws of its jurisdiction and has all necessary corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted, to own or lease and operate its assets and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this agreement.

(b) each selling holder, to the extent permitted by law, will indemnify and hold harmless magna, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls magna within the meaning of the u.s. securities act or the u.s. exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from magna to such selling holder, but only with respect to selling holder information regarding such selling holder. (c) each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless each other selling holder, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls a selling holder within the meaning of the u.s. securities act or the u.s. exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from magna to the selling holders, but only with respect to selling holder information regarding such selling holder; provided, however, that the liability of each selling holder pursuant to all indemnities given by such selling holder pursuant to this section 2.6 shall not be greater in aggregate amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any selling expenses) received by such selling holder from the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to all such indemnifications unless such liability arises out of or is based on wilful misconduct by such selling holder. (d) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but any failure so to notify or delay in so notifying the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party unless, and to the extent that, the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying 13 party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it elects to do so, to assume and undertake the defence thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defence thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 2.6 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defence thereof; provided, however, that: (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defence and employ counsel within a reasonable period; or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defences available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or that the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defence and otherwise to participate in the defence of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. (e) if, for any reason, the indemnification provided for in this section 2.6 is unavailable to magna or the selling holders or is insufficient to hold any of them harmless in respect of any losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses as between magna on the one hand and each selling holder on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of magna on the one hand and of each selling holder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that gave rise to such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of magna on the one hand and each selling holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statements of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (f) no indemnified party shall settle any claim or admit any wrongdoing without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
