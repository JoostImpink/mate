item 6. contract arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer on august 23, 2000, mony, mony acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of mony ("merger sub"), and advest entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") pursuant to which, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, advest would merge with and into merger sub (the cusip no. 007566102 page 6 of 9 "merger"). in connection with the execution of the merger agreement between mony group, inc. and the issuer, peter r. kellogg, along with other shareholders, entered into a support agreement dated august 23, 2000 (the "support agreement"). the number of shares of advest common stock beneficially owned by peter r. kellog is set forth above. pursuant to the merger agreement, stockholders of advest may elect to receive, in exchange for each outstanding share of advest common stock that they own, either cash, shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of mony ("mony common stock"), or a combination of cash and shares of mony common stock, having in each instance a value based on the average closing price of mony common stock over a specified time period. these elections by stockholders of advest will then be adjusted on a pro rata basis to produce an aggregate purchase price consisting of 49.9% cash and 50.1% mony common stock. no additional consideration was given in exchange for the support agreement. in the support agreement, each stockholder has agreed to vote all of his shares of advest common stock in favor of the merger, the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stock option agreement, at any meeting of stockholders of advest called to vote upon such matters or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including by written consent) with respect to such matters is sought (the "special meeting"). each stockholder has further agreed not to take any action to revoke or terminate, or permit to be revoked or terminated, any trust for which the stockholder serves as trustee, or take any other action which would restrict, limit or frustrate the stockholder's right to vote the stockholder's shares of advest common stock, including on behalf of such trust, in accordance with the support agreement. each stockholder has granted to, and appointed, mony and michael i. roth, richard daddario and kenneth m. levine, in their capacities as officers of mony, and their successors as officers of mony, and each of them individually, the stockholder's irrevocable proxy (coupled with an interest) and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of the stockholder, to vote all of such stockholder's shares of advest common stock, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such shares, in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. cusip no. 007566102 page 7 of 8 pursuant to the terms of the support agreement, each stockholder has agreed that, until the close of business on the date of the special meeting, such stockholder will not (a) sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer any of its advest common stock, (b) deposit its advest common stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such advest common stock or grant any proxy with respect thereto, or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any advest common stock. the stockholder may make bona fide gifts of shares of advest common stock, and may make transfers of advest common stock into one or more trusts for estate or tax planning purposes, so long as the recipient of such gift, or such trust, as applicable, enters into an agreement with mony substantially identical to the support agreement. pursuant to the terms of the support agreement, each stockholder has agreed, prior to the effective time, (a) to not permit any agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it) to, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to advest's stockholders) with respect to an alternative proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) or with respect to any tender offer for or solicitation of proxies with respect to any shares of advest common stock, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an alternative proposal or relating to any tender offer for or solicitation of proxies with respect to any shares of advest common stock, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an alternative proposal or any tender offer for or solicitation of proxies with respect to any shares of advest common stock and (b) to notify mony immediately in writing if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, that stockholder in that stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of advest. certain of the stockholders are officers or directors of advest. pursuant to the terms of the support agreement, each stockholder signed the support agreement solely in his capacity as the record holder and beneficial owner of, or the trustee of a trust whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of, such stockholder's securities and nothing cusip no. 007566102 page 8 of 8 therein shall limit or affect any actions taken by such stockholder in his capacity as an officer or director of advest to the extent specifically permitted by the merger agreement. the purpose of the transactions under the stock option agreement and the support agreement is to enable mony to consummate the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement. the stock option agreement and support agreement may also make it more difficult and expensive for advest to consummate a business combination with a party other than mony. in particular, the stock option agreement could eliminate the ability of another party to acquire advest in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits the agreement and plan of merger, stock option agreement and support agreement were all previously filed with the mony group inc.'s schedule 13d filing dated september 18, 2000. signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set fourth in this statement is true, complete and correct. dated: october 4, 2000 peter r. kellogg peter r. kellogg -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
