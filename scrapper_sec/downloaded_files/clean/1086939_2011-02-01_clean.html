notice period &#8221;), a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor), cause the offer previously constituting a superior proposal to no longer constitute a superior proposal.&#160; the company agrees to negotiate in good faith with parent during any notice period to allow parent to match or better any superior proposal (as amended).&#160; any changes to the financial terms or any change to other material terms of such superior proposal occurring prior to the company&#8217;s effecting an adverse recommendation change or terminating this agreement pursuant to this section&#160;4.2(b)&#160;shall require the company to provide to parent a new adverse recommendation change notice or superior proposal notice and a new notice period and to comply with the requirements of this section&#160;4.2(b)&#160;with respect to each such new written notice.&#160;

the company shall not submit any takeover proposal or any superior proposal to a vote of the stockholders of the company prior to the termination of this agreement. &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

the damages resulting from termination of this agreement under circumstances where a company termination fee is payable are uncertain and incapabl e of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this section&#160;5.6 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this agreement and in reliance on this agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. &#160;

fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in section&#160;5.6(d)&#160;at the prime rate of citibank, n.a. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.&#160; notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in the event that the parent termination fee or parent default fee becomes payable, then the parent termination fee or parent default fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the company and its affiliates and their stockholders under this agreement.&#160; if the company terminates this agreement pursuant to section&#160;7.1(e)&#160;in the case of a willful breach by parent or merger sub, then the company may seek company damages against parent; provided , that the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the parent termination fee) of parent and merger sub, collectively, shall not exceed the parent liability cap.&#160; the damages resulting from termination of this agreement under circumstances where a parent termination fee or p arent default fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this section&#160;5.6 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this agreement and in reliance on this agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. &#160;
