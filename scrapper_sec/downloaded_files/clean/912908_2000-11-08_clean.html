trustee's performance of its obligations hereunder and (b) any and all rights of the bank in connection with the pre-petition liens or the pre-petition collateral (it being understood and agreed that the foregoing release of pre-petition claims shall not in any way impair the pre-petition liens or any rights of the bank with respect thereto, but shall only constitute a release of the bank's deficiency claim, if any, with respect to the pre-petition claims (and the pre-petition claims shall continue to have recourse to the pre-petition collateral notwithstanding such release)). 3. payment by bank. on or as soon as practicable after the --------------- effective date, the bank shall pay to the trustee the amount of $137,185, which payment shall be made by a check payable to "john s.

stock (which shares shall not include excluded shares) for certain preferred stock of foamex pursuant to an agreement between the bank and foamex or as otherwise determined by the bank in a written notice to the trustee if such agreement has terminated by its terms, the bank shall become the owner of the excluded shares, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, charges, restrictions, security interests, adverse claims, pledges or demands whatsoever, as if the bank had validly foreclosed thereon in accordance with applicable law (without necessity of seeking or obtaining relief from the bankruptcy court or taking any other action whatsoever), (c) all rights of the trustee releasors with respect to the pre-petition collateral shall terminate and (d) the trustee shall take all action reasonably requested by the bank to confirm and reflect such ownership and termination. -4- 5. upon receipt by the trustee of the settlement payment pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, the trustee will segregate $137,500 in an account (the "segregated account") in the name of the trustee, but for the direct benefit of sonnenschein nath & rosenthal ("sonnenschein"), the debtors' chapter 11 counsel. the funds in the segregated account (the "segregated funds") shall be applied to sonnenschein's fees and expenses, if any, allowed by the bankruptcy court for sonnenschein's representation of the debtors in their chapter 11 cases (collectively, the "allowed sonnenschein fees"). the trustee shall maintain the $137,500 in the segregated account until sonnenschein's fees and expenses are allowed by the bankruptcy court, at which time such funds, upon the request of sonnenschein, shall be promptly paid by the trustee to sonnenschein upon entry of a final order of the bankruptcy court approving such fees and expenses subject to the terms and conditions herein. any excess of the allowed sonnenschein fees over the segregated funds shall constitute allowed chapter 11 administrative claims and shall be treated as such in accordance with applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code. any excess of the segregated funds over the allowed sonnenschein fees shall revert to the debtors' chapter 7 estate, free and clear of any claim or interest of sonnenschein or any other person or entity. sonnenschein hereby withdraws its objection to this stipulation and, effective upon the effective date, releases and discharges the trustee, the bank and their respective present and former directors, officers, employees, agents, financial advisors, attorneys, administrators, successors and assigns from any and all claims under the dip order, including without limitation paragraph 9 thereof. sonnenschein shall be deemed to be a party to this stipulation for purposes of enforcing its rights, and fulfilling its obligations, under this paragraph 5. 6. miscellaneous. ------------- the trustee shall promptly attempt to obtain bankruptcy court approval of this stipulation pursuant to an order in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the bank (an "approval order"). the parties agree that the approval order may be this stipulation as "so ordered" by the bankruptcy court on the signature pages hereof. as used herein, "effective date" means the first business day on which the approval order becomes a final, non-appealable order. this bankruptcy court shall have continuing jurisdiction to enforce this stipulation and to determine any and all disputes arising hereunder or related hereto. this stipulation constitutes the entire understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and this stipulation may not be changed, modified or altered in any manner except in writing, signed by both parties. except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this stipulation shall constitute or be deemed to be an admission by any party of liability or as an acknowledgement of the truth of any allegation asserted by the parties. the background is incorporated into and is a part of this stipulation. -5- this stipulation shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york (excluding conflicts of laws) and by the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code. 7. this stipulation may be executed in a number of counterparts and all such counterparts shall be taken to be one agreement. 8. the notice provided
