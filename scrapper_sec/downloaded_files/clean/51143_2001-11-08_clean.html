subject shares constitute approximately 35.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of issuer common stock, based on the issuer's representation in the merger agreement that there were 26,775,214 shares of issuer common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on october 29, 2001. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, the stockholders have agreed, among other things, (a) to vote the subject shares in favor of (i) the adoption of the merger agreement, (ii) the approval of the terms of the merger agreement and (iii) the approval of the merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (b) to vote the subject shares against (i) any takeover proposal (as such term is defined in section 4.02 of the merger agreement) and (ii) any amendment of the issuer's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws or other proposal, action or transaction involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries or any of its stockholders, in each case that could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stockholder agreement or to dilute in any material respect the benefits to ibm of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the stockholder agreement, or change in any manner the voting rights of the issuer common stock, (c) prior to the stockholders meeting (as defined in section 5.01(b) of the merger agreement), not to sell, transfer, pledge, assign, tender or otherwise dispose of any subject shares (or consent to any such action) or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of such subject shares unless, prior to any such action, the transferee enters into a stockholder agreement with ibm that is substantially identical to the stockholder agreement and (d) not to enter into any voting agreement or arrangement in connection with any takeover proposal or frustrating transaction (as such term is defined in section 3(b) of the stockholder agreement) with respect to any subject shares, other than pursuant to the stockholder agreement. by their execution of the stockholder agreement, each stockholder has irrevocably appointed ibm and david s. hershberg, vice president - assistant general counsel of ibm, andrew bonzani, assistant secretary and senior counsel of ibm, and david l. johnson, vice president of corporate development of ibm, in their respective capacities as designees of ibm, and any individual who shall thereafter succeed to any such office of ibm, and each of them individually, as his or her proxy and attorney-in-fact (the "attorney"). the name of each stockholder and the number of subject shares owned of record or beneficially by each stockholder are set forth in schedule a to the stockholder agreement, which is attached as exhibit 2 hereto. in exercising its right to vote the subject shares as proxy and attorney-in-fact of the stockholders, the attorney's rights are limited to voting the subject shares, or granting a consent or approval with respect to the subject shares, (a) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the terms thereof and of the merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (b) against any takeover proposal or any frustrating transaction and (c) otherwise in accordance with the covenants of each stockholder in section 3 of the stockholder agreement. the proxy granted in the stockholder agreement terminates upon termination of the stockholder agreement. 4 in addition to the voting agreements and arrangements described above, each stockholder has granted ibm an option to purchase any and all of the subject shares of such stockholder, within three business days following the later of (a) a request by ibm to purchase such subject shares and (b) the last to occur of (i) expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to such sale and purchase under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, or any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation and (ii) the receipt of any other regulatory approvals applicable to such sale and purchase, for a purchase price equal to $4.65 per share in cash. further, the stockholder agreement contains provisions (the "profit provisions") pursuant to which if (a) the termination fee (as such term is defined in the stockholder agreement) becomes payable pursuant to the merger agreement and a takeover proposal is consummated or (b) a takeover proposal made by ibm (including any amendment of the merger agreement) which provides for transaction consideration (as such term is defined in the stockholder agreement) in excess of $4.65, is consummated, then each stockholder is required to pay to ibm the amount in cash equal to such stockholder's profit (as such term is defined in the stockholder agreement), provided, however, that if all or any part of the transaction consideration which such stockholder is entitled to receive is not cash, then such stockholder's profit shall be paid to ibm in each type of consideration paid to such stockholder and in the same proportions as the types of consideration comprising the transaction consideration which such stockholder is entitled to receive, in each case determined at the close of business on the date of the consummation of the takeover proposal referred to in clause (a) or (b) of this paragraph in the manner set forth in the stockholder agreement. the stockholder agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) such date and time as the merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (ii) the date of termination of the merger agreement if the merger agreement is terminated according to its terms, provided, however, that if the merger agreement is terminated following one the following events: (a) (i) a takeover proposal has been made to the issuer or its stockholders or any person has announced an intention to make a takeover proposal or a takeover proposal otherwise becomes known to the stockholders of the issuer or any person or group acquires ownership of 10% or more of the issuer common stock; (ii) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated due to the lack of consummation of the merger by march 31, 2002, or the failure to obtain the approval of the issuer's stockholders to the merger; and (iii) within 12 months after such termination the issuer or any of its subsidiaries enters into any acquisition agreement (as such term is defined in section 4.02(b) of the merger agreement) with respect to, or consummates, any takeover proposal (for this purpose, as such term is defined in section 5.06(b) of the merger agreement); or (b) the merger agreement is terminated by ibm in the event that (i) the board of directors of the issuer or any committee thereof shall withdraw or adversely modify, or propose publicly or agree to withdraw or adversely modify, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such board of directors or any such committee of the merger agreement or the merger, or shall resolve or agree to take any such action, or (ii) the board of directors of the issuer or any committee thereof shall have failed to confirm its recommendation and declaration of advisability of the merger agreement and the merger within ten business days after a written request by ibm that it do so, then (a) the profit provisions and any other related provisions of the stockholder agreement shall continue in full force and effect during the 12 month period described in clause (a) of this paragraph and (b) the option granted under the stockholder agreement and any other related provisions of the stockholder agreement shall continue in full force and effect for six months following the termination of the merger agreement. (c) neither ibm nor, to the knowledge of ibm, any person named in schedule a, has effected any transaction in the issuer common stock during the past 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer other than as described in items 3, 4 and 5 and the agreements incorporated herein by reference and set forth as exhibits hereto, to the knowledge of ibm, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint 5

(ii) the "profit" of each stockholder shall mean, as of the close of business on the date of consummation of a transaction, the amount (if a positive number) equal to (a) the product of (1) the transaction consideration which such stockholder is entitled to receive minus the deal price (as determined at such time) multiplied by (2) the number of subject shares held by such stockholder on the date of this agreement (other than any subject shares sold, transferred and delivered to parent or its designee pursuant to section 3(h) hereof), minus (b) any profit taxes. (iii) "transaction consideration" shall mean, with respect to any transaction, the fair market value of the consideration which such stockholder is entitled to receive (including any residual interest in the company retained immediately following consummation of a transaction) in respect of each share of company common stock of such stockholder in such transaction, determined as of the close of business on the date of the consummation of such transaction, provided that if different types or amounts of consideration are to be paid (or retained) in a transaction, the "transaction consideration" shall be determined by dividing (1) the aggregate fair market value of all the consideration (determined as of the close of business on the date of the consummation of such transaction) so paid to (and retained by) such stockholder by (2) the number of subject shares held by such stockholder on the date of this agreement (other than any subject shares sold, transferred and delivered to parent or its designee pursuant to section 3(h) hereof). 7 (iv) for purposes of this section 3(g), the "fair market value" of any noncash consideration consisting of: (a) securities listed on a national securities exchange or traded on the nasdaq shall be equal to the average closing price per share of such security as reported on such exchange or nasdaq for the 10 trading days prior to the date of determination; and (b) consideration which is other than securities of the form specified in clause (a) of this clause (iv) shall be determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm mutually selected, within three business days after the event requiring selection of such investment banking firm, by parent and the stockholders, which determination shall be made by such investment banking firm within 15 business days after the date of such event; provided, however, that if parent and the stockholders do not agree within three business days after the date of such event as to the selection of an investment banking firm, then, by the end of the fifth business day after the date of such event, each of parent, on the one hand, and the stockholders, on the other hand, shall select an investment banking firm, which two investment banking firms shall jointly make such determination within 20 business days after the date of such event, or, if such two investment banking firms are unable to agree on such determination, the two investment banking firms shall, by the end of the 20th business day after the date of such event, select a third investment banking firm and notify such third investment banking firm in writing (with a copy to parent and each stockholder) of their respective determinations of the fair market value of such noncash consideration, following which such third investment banking firm shall, within 15 business days after the date of its selection, notify parent and each stockholder in writing of its selection of one or the other of the two original determinations of the fair market value of such noncash consideration; provided further, that the reasonable and customary fees and expenses of all such investment banking firms shall be borne equally by parent, on the one hand, and the stockholders, on the other hand. the determination of the investment banking firm shall be binding upon the parties. (v) the "profit taxes" of each stockholder shall mean the net amount of income taxes (u.s. federal, state and local) actually incurred by such stockholder solely as a result of either the receipt of profits by such stockholder or the payment of profits by such stockholder to parent in accordance with the terms of this agreement, in each case determined taking into account any income, gain, deduction, loss or offset against income taxes attributable to the payment of profits by such stockholder to parent in accordance with the terms of this agreement; provided, however, that solely for the purposes of calculating profit taxes, clause (b) of the definition of profits shall be disregarded. solely for purposes of calculating profit taxes, in the case of a stockholder that is treated 8 as a pass-through entity for u.s. federal, state or local income tax purposes, as the case may be, the term "stockholder" shall mean any direct member of such pass-through entity and any indirect member of such pass-through entity that owns its interest in such pass-through entity to the extent it owns such interest through one or more other pass-through entities. for the purposes of this clause, a "pass-through entity" includes, without limitation, a partnership, disregarded entity, trust, subchapter s corporation, controlled foreign corporation, foreign person holding company or a passive foreign investment company to the extent a qualifying electing fund election has been made with respect to it.
