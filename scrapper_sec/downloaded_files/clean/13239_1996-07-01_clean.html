(a) and (b) as of june 20, 1996, under the definition of "beneficial ownership" as set forth in rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, borden may be deemed to have beneficially owned 2,294,695 shares of common stock subject to the stockholders agreements (the "shares"), constituting approximately 49.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on the number of shares of common stock represented by the issuer in the purchase agreement to be outstanding as of june 20, 1996). in addition to the shares, pursuant to the voting agreement, egs partners, l.l.c. ("egs") has agreed to vote 314,302 shares of common stock, representing certain managed accounts (the "managed accounts shares"), in favor of the purchase and issuance of shares of common stock to borden in connection therewith. because egs's voting power with respect to certain of the managed accounts shares is subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and all of such shares are subject to whatever instructions may be given by the client, the managed accounts shares have not been counted as shares of common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the reporting persons. borden is a wholly owned subsidiary of borden holdings and borden holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of bw holdings. whitehall associates is the managing member of bw holdings. kkr associates is the sole general partner of whitehall associates. therefore, borden holdings, bw holdings, whitehall associates and kkr associates each has the power to direct the voting of any shares of common stock deemed to be beneficially owned by borden. as a result, borden holdings, bw holdings, whitehall associates and kkr associates may each be deemed to beneficially own any shares of common stock deemed to be beneficially owned by borden. each of messrs. kravis, roberts, macdonnell, raether, michelson, fox, greene, tokarz, robbins, stuart, gilhuly and golkin, the general partners of kkr associates, has shared power to vote or direct the vote of any shares of common stock deemed to be beneficially owned by kkr associates. as a result, each of the general partners of kkr associates may be deemed to beneficially own any shares of common stock that kkr associates may be deemed to beneficially own. neither the filing of this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that any reporting person is the beneficial owner of the common stock referred to in this paragraph for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. (c) except as set forth in this item 5, to the best knowledge of each of the reporting persons, none of the reporting persons and no other person described in item 2 hereof has beneficial ownership of, or has engaged in any transaction during the past 60 days in, any shares of common stock. (d) the stockholders will continue to have the right to receive dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, all shares of common stock subject to the stockholders agreements. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements or understandings with respect to securities of the issuer. except as set forth in this statement, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities of the issuer, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees or profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the securities of the issuer. item

(c) with respect to third-party claims, all claims for indemnification by the buyer or the seller, as the case may be (an "indemnified party") hereunder shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this section 9.4(c). in the event that any written claim or demand for which the buyer or the seller, as the case may be (an "indemnifying party"), would be liable to any indemnified party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any indemnified party by a third party, such indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand) ( the "claim notice"). failure to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence of actual prejudice. the indemnifying party shall have 20 days from the personal delivery or mailing of the claim notice (the "notice period") to notify the indemnified party (a) whether or not the indemnifying party disputes the liability of the indemnifying party to the indemnified party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (b) whether or not it desires to defend the indemnified party against such claim or demand. all costs and expenses incurred by the indemnifying party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the indemnifying party; provided, however, that the amount of such costs and expenses that shall be a liability of the indemnifying party hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in sections 9.4(a) and 9.4(b) hereof. except as hereinafter provided, in the event that the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the notice period that it desires to defend the indemnified party against such claim or demand, the indemnifying party shall have the right to defend the indemnified party with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense and the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 9.4 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation and costs and expenses of legal counsel, if the indemnified party and the indemnifying party are both parties to the action and the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more defenses available to it and not available to the indemnifying party. if any indemnified party desires to participate in any such defense, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. the indemnified party shall not settle a claim or demand without the consent of the indemnifying party unless prior thereto or in connection therewith the indemnified party unconditionally releases the indemnifying party for any liability arising out of such claim or demand. the indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of the indemnified party or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof or if such settlement or compromise does not include an unconditional release of the indemnified party for any liability arising out of such claim or demand. if the indemnifying party elects not to defend the indemnified party against such claim or demand, whether by not giving the indemnified party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand or, if the same be contested by the indemnified party, that portion thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such defense), shall be the liability of the indemnifying party hereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 9.4(a) and 9.4(b). the buyer and the seller shall each render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and adequate defense of any such claim or proceeding. (d) the indemnities provided in this section 9.4 shall survive the closing. the indemnity provided in this section 9.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the indemnified party against the indemnifying party at law or equity for any matter covered by paragraphs (a) and (b). (e) the amount of any damages for which indemnification is provided under this section 9.4 shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds received by the indemnified party in connection with such damages. if the amount with respect to which any claim is made under this section 9.4 (an "indemnity claim") gives rise to a currently realizable tax benefit (as defined below) to the party making the claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the tax benefit available to the party making the claim. to the extent such indemnity claim does not give rise to a currently realizable tax benefit, if the amount with respect to which any indemnity claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized tax benefit to the party that made the claim, such party shall refund to the indemnifying party the amount of such tax benefit when, as and if realized. for the purposes of this agreement, any subsequently realized tax benefit shall be treated as though it were a reduction in the amount of the initial indemnity claim, and the liabilities of the parties shall be redetermined as though both occurred at or prior to the time of the indemnity payment. for purposes of this section 9.4(e), a "tax benefit" means an amount by which the tax liability of the party (or group of corporations including the party) is reduced (including, without limitation, by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. where a party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the tax benefit from any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the indemnity claim shall be deemed to be realized proportionately with any other losses, deductions, credits or items. for the purposes of this section 9.4(e), a tax benefit is "currently realizable" to the extent it can be reasonably anticipated that such tax benefit will be realized in the current taxable period or year or in any tax return with respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the indemnity claim. in the event that there should be a determination disallowing the tax benefit, the indemnifying party shall be liable to refund to the indemnified party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments previously made to the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 9.4(e). the amount of the refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under this section 9.4 and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions under this section 9.4(e). (f) the parties agree that any indemnification payments that may be due from the seller to the buyer pursuant to section 9.4(a) hereof may be paid at the option of seller (i) in u.s. dollars in the amount of the damages or (ii) in such number of shares of buyer common stock held by seller or its affiliates equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the amount of damages by (b) the average of the closing prices of the buyer common stock on the nasdaq national market, as reported in the wall street journal, for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the date of payment thereof. (g) the parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price, unless otherwise required by applicable law. the buyer agrees not to make any election under section 338 of the code unless the seller consents to such election in writing. (h) notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no damages shall be due pursuant to this section 9.4 for any matters covered by the post-closing adjustment provisions of section 2.4. (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither party hereto nor any affiliate of either of them shall be liable for any consequential, punitive or special damages pursuant to this agreement or any of the agreements contemplated hereby. 9.5. notices. all notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly received if so given) by hand delivery, by mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or by any courier service, such as federal express, providing proof of delivery. all communications hereunder shall be delivered to the respective parties at the following addresses: (a) if to the seller: borden, inc. 180 east broad street columbus, ohio 43215 attention: richard l. de ney with copies to: simpson thacher & bartlett 425 lexington avenue new york, new york 10017 attention: david j. sorkin, esq. and kohlberg kravis roberts & co. 9 west 57th street new york, new york 10019 attention: scott m. stuart (b) if to the buyer: aep industries inc. 125 phillips avenue south hackensack, new jersey 07606 attention: paul m. feeney, executive vice president with a copy to: bachner, tally, polevoy & misher llp 380 madison avenue new york, new york 10017 attention: paul e. gelbard, esq. or to such other address as either party shall have specified by notice in writing to the other party. all such notices, requests, demands and communications shall be deemed to have been received on the date of personal delivery or telecopy or on the third business day after the mailing thereof. 9.6. entire agreement. this agreement (including the exhibits hereto and the disclosure schedules) together with the stockholders agreement and the governance agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 9.7. binding effect;

(a) at any time, and from time to time, on and after the closing date, the holders of at least 25% of the then registrable securities (the "initiating holders") may request in a written notice that the company file a registration statement under the securities act (or a similar document pursuant to any other statute then in effect corresponding to the securities act) covering the registration of any or all registrable securities held by such initiating holders in the manner specified in such notice. following receipt of any notice under this section 6.3 the company shall (x) within ten days notify all other holders of such request in writing and (y) thereupon will, as expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to cause to be registered under the securities act all registrable securities that the initiating holders and such other holders have, within ten days after the company has given such notice, requested be registered in accordance with the manner of disposition specified in such notice by the initiating holders; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the company shall not be required to have any such registration statement be declared effective by the sec prior to the six month anniversary of the closing date. (b) if the initiating holders intend to have the registrable securities distributed by means of an underwritten offering, the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in clause (x) of section 6.3(a) above. in such event, the right of any holder to include its registrable securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwritten offering and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwritten offering (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and such holder) to the extent provided below. all holders proposing to distribute registrable securities through such underwritten offering shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters. such underwriter or underwriters shall be selected by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and shall be approved by the company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. no holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder, the registrable securities of such holder and such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by law or reasonably required by the underwriter. if any holder of registrable securities disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw all its registrable securities by written notice to the company, the managing underwriter and the initiating holders. the securities so withdrawn also shall be withdrawn from registration. (c) notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, the company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section 6.3 during the period starting with the date of filing by the company of, and ending on a date 180 days following the effective date of, (i) any registration statement requested under this section 6.3(a) or section 6.5 or (ii) a registration statement pertaining to a public offering of securities for the account of the company or on behalf of the selling stockholders under any other registration rights agreement, in each case which the holders have been entitled to join pursuant to section 6.4; provided that (x) the company shall actively employ in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause any such registration statement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above to become effective as soon as possible and (y) with respect to any such registration statement involving an underwritten offering, the 180 day period referred to above may be reduced or waived in the discretion of the managing underwriter for such offering. (d) a registration requested pursuant to this section 6.3 shall not be deemed to have been effected pursuant to this section 6.3 for purposes of section 6.8 unless (i) it has been declared effective by the commission, (ii) it has remained effective for the period set forth in section 6.6(a), and (iii) the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such registration is not subject to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission (other than any such stop order, injunction, or other requirement of the commission prompted by any act or omission of holders of registrable securities). (e) subject to the following sentence, if a requested registration pursuant to this section 6.3 involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration (including securities of the company which are not registrable securities) exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the company will include in such registration only the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration. in the event that the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the number of such registrable securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated pro rata among all requesting holders on the basis of the relative number of shares of registrable securities then held by each such holder (provided that any shares hereby allocated to any such holder that exceed such holder's request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting holders in like manner). in the event that the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration is less than the number which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, the company may include in such registration the securities the company proposes to sell up to the number of securities that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, may be sold at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities. the company will not include in any requested registration pursuant to this section 6.3 any securities which are not registrable securities (other than securities of the company) without the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities included in such registration. (f) if the board of directors of the company, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of registrable securities should not be made or continued due to a valid need not to disclose confidential information or because it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other transaction involving the company (collectively, a "valid business reason"), the company may postpone filing a registration statement relating to a request for registration under this section 6.3 until such valid business reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than three months from the date of the notice referred to below, and, in case any such registration statement has been filed the company may, with respect to a registration effected pursuant to this section 6.3, cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may, with respect to a registration effected pursuant to this section 6.3 or section 6.5, postpone amending or supplementing such registration statement; and the company shall give written notice (a "delay notice") of its determination to postpone or withdraw a registration statement and of the fact that the valid business reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. upon the request of any holder of registrable securities included or to be included in any such registration statement, the company will disclose to such holder the nature of such valid business reason in reasonable detail; provided, that such holder executes a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the company; provided, further, that any such confidentiality agreement shall terminate upon the public disclosure of such valid business reason. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (f), no registration statement filed and subsequently withdrawn by reason of any existing or anticipated valid business reason as hereinabove provided shall count as one of the four registration statements effected pursuant to this section 6.3 or section 6.5 for purposes of section 6.8 and the company shall be entitled to serve only one delay notice (i) within any period of 270 consecutive days, if such delay notice relates to a request under section 6.3(a) (or 180 consecutive days, if such delay notice relates to a request under section 6.5) or (ii) with respect to any two consecutive registrations requested pursuant to this section 6.3 or section 6.5. section 6.4. incidental registration. subject to section 6.9, if at any time the company determines that it shall file a registration statement under the securities act (other than a registration statement on a form s-4 or s-8 or any successor or similar forms) on any form that also would permit the registration of the registrable securities and such filing is to be on its behalf and/or on behalf of selling holders of its securities for the general registration of its common stock to be sold for cash, the company shall each such time promptly give each holder written notice of such determination setting forth the date on which the company proposes to file such registration statement, which date shall be no earlier than thirty days from the date of such notice, and advising each holder of its right to have registrable securities included in such registration. upon the written request of any holder received by the company no later than fifteen days after the date of the company's notice, the company shall use its best efforts to cause to be registered under the securities act all of the registrable securities that each such holder has so requested to be registered; provided that if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to proceed with the proposed registration of the securities to be sold by it, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder of registrable securities and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holder to request such registration to be effected as a registration under section 6.3. if, in the written opinion of the managing underwriter (or, in the case of a non-underwritten offering, in the written opinion of the company), the total amount of such securities to be so registered, including such registrable securities, will exceed the maximum amount of the company's securities that can be marketed at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of such securities, then the company shall include in such registration (i) first, all the securities the company proposes to sell for its own account or is required to register on behalf of any third party exercising rights similar to those granted in section 6.3(a) and without having the adverse effect referred to above, and (ii) second, to the extent that the number of securities which the company proposes to sell for its own account pursuant to this section 6.4 or is required to register on behalf of any third party exercising rights similar to those granted in section 6.3(a) is less than the number of equity securities which the company has been advised can be sold in such offering without having the adverse effect referred to above, all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.4 and all shares of common stock requested to be included by third parties exercising the rights similar to those granted in this section 6.4; provided that if the number of registrable securities and other shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.4 and third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in this section 6.4, together with the number of securities to be included in such registration pursuant to clause (i) of this section 6.4, exceeds the number which the company has been advised can be sold in such offering without having the adverse effect referred to above, the number of such registerable securities requested to be included in such registration by the holders pursuant to this section 6.4 shall be limited to such extent and shall be allocated pro rata among all such requesting holders and third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in this section 6.4 on the basis of the relative number of registrable securities each such holder has requested to be included in such registration and the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such registration by such third parties. section 6.5. registration on form s-3. if at any time (a) any holder requests in writing that the company file a registration statement on form s-3 or any successor thereto for a public offering of all or any portion of the registrable securities held by such requesting holder and (b) the company is a registrant entitled to use form s-3 or any successor thereto, then the company shall use its best efforts to register under the securities act on form s-3 or any successor thereto, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such request, including, without limitation, pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act, the registrable securities specified in such request. whenever the company is required by this section 6.5 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of registrable securities, each of the limitations, procedures and requirements of section 6.3(b), (c), (e) and (f) (including but not limited to the requirement that the company notify all holders from whom a request has not been received and provide them with the opportunity to participate in the offering) shall apply to such registration. section 6.6. obligations of the company. whenever required under section 6.3 or section 6.5 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period of the distribution contemplated thereby determined as provided hereafter;

(c) furnish to the holders such numbers of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto in conformity with the requirements of the securities act) and such other documents and information as they may reasonably request and make available for inspection by the parties referred to in section 6.6(d) below such financial and other information and books and records of the company, and cause the officers, directors, employees, counsel and independent certified public accountants of the company to respond to such inquiries, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the judgment of the respective counsel referred to in such section, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of section 11 of the securities act;

(the "nasd") or listing fees, all fees and expenses of complying with state securities or blue sky laws, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, any fees and disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by the issuers or sellers of securities, including liability insurance if the company so desires or if the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any special experts retained in connection with the requested registration and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of holders, shall be paid by the company. the foregoing provisions with respect to expenses shall in no way limit the rights of the holders to request registration pursuant to sections 6.3 and 6.5 or the number of registrations which may be requested thereunder. section 6.9. underwriting requirements. in connection with any underwritten offering, the company shall not be required under section 6.4 to include registrable securities in such underwritten offering unless the holders of such registrable securities accept the terms of the underwriting of such offering that have been reasonably agreed upon between the company and the underwriters selected by the company. section 6.10. rule 144 and rule 144a information. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, at all times, the company agrees to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act; (ii) use its best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (iii) furnish to each holder of registrable securities forthwith upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of such rule 144 and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents so filed by the company as such holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing such holder to sell any registrable securities without registration. section 6.11. indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: (a) the company shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder, such holder's directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls such holder or participating person within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) to which they may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6.11(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided further that the company shall not be liable to any holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling person in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling person; provided, further, that as to any preliminary prospectus or any final prospectus this indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any holder, such holder's directors and officers or controlling persons on account of any losses, claims, damages or liability arising from the sale of common stock to any person by such holder if such holder or its representatives failed to send or give a copy of the final prospectus or a prospectus supplement, as the case may be (excluding documents incorporated by reference therein), as the same may be amended or supplemented, to that person within the time required by the securities act, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus was corrected in the final prospectus or such prospectus supplement, as the case may be (excluding documents incorporated by reference therein), unless such failure resulted from non-compliance by the company with section 6.6(c). such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any such holder, such holder's directors and officers, participating person or controlling person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. (b) each holder requesting or joining in a registration severally and not jointly shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to the holders but only with reference to written information relating to such holder furnished to the company expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6.11(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further that the liability of each holder hereunder shall be limited to the proportion of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense that is equal to the proportion that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares sold by such holder under such registration statement bears to the total net proceeds from the sale of all securities sold thereunder, but not in any event to exceed the net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement. (c) in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. such firm shall be designated in writing by the holders, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, and by the company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) if the indemnification provided for in the first or second paragraph of this section 6.11 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6.11(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 6.11, no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the remedies provided for in this section 6.11 are not exclusive and shall not limit any right or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. section 6.12. lockup. each holder shall, in connection with any registration of the company's securities, upon the request of the company or the underwriters managing any underwritten offering of such securities, agree in writing not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of any registrable securities (other than that included in the registration) without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter for such period of time (not to exceed 180 days) from the effective date of such registration as the company or the underwriters may specify; provided, however, that all executive officers and directors of the company (other than executive officers and directors owning an aggregate of less than 1% of the outstanding common stock as of the effective date of such registration statement) shall also have agreed not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of any registrable securities under the circumstances and pursuant to the terms set forth in this section 6.12. section 6.13. transfer of registration rights. the registration rights of any holder under this agreement with respect to the registrable securities may be transferred to any transferee of such registrable securities who acquires any registrable securities of any holder; provided that such registration rights may not be transferred to a holder of less than 1% of the outstanding common stock unless such transferee is a borden affiliate (or a partner of a borden affiliate); provided, further, that (i) the transferring holder shall give the company written notice at or prior to the time of such transfer stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which the rights under this agreement are being transferred, (ii) such transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to be bound as a holder by the provisions of this section, and (iii) immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such securities by such transferee is restricted under the securities act. section 6.14. selection of counsel. in connection with any registration of registrable securities pursuant to sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 hereof, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by any such registration may select one counsel to represent all holders of registrable securities covered by such registration; provided, however, that in the event that the counsel selected as provided above is also acting as counsel to the company in connection with such registration, the remaining holders shall be entitled to select one additional counsel to represent all such remaining holders. article vii representations and warranties section 7.1. representations of the company. as of the date hereof and as of the closing date the company represents and warrants as follows: (a) authority relative to this agreement. the company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the "transactions"). the execution and delivery of this agreement by the company and the consummation by the company of the transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the company are necessary to authorize this agreement or to consummate the transactions. this agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by borden, constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the company.
