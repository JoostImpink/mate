warrants &#148;), in consideration for the extension of a $200 million loan (the &#147; loan &#148;) by investor to certain subsidiaries of the issuer.&#160; immediately thereafter, investor transferred the warrants to its parent company, marine holdings.&#160; investor funded the loan through debt and equity investments by marine holdings.&#160; marine holdings received the capital for its investment in investor from pf5, pf5 parallel, apof and ffa, each a limited partner of marine holdings. item 4.&#160;&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction on march 29, 2011, investor entered into a credit agreement (the &#147; credit agreement &#148;), by and among general maritime subsidiary corporation, general maritime subsidiary ii corporation, each, a marshall islands corporation (collectively, the &#147; borrowers &#148;), the issuer, investor and ocm administrative agent, llc, a delaware limited liability company, pursuant to which investor agreed to make the loan to the borrowers in exchange for pay-in-kind toggle floating rate secured notes (the &#147; notes &#148;).&#160; the notes have a seven-year maturity and bear interest at a rate per annum based on libor (with a minimum of 3%) plus a margin ranging from 6% to 9%.&#160; interest on the notes is payable, at the issuer&#146;s option, in cash or in additional notes. the notes are secured on a third lien basis by substantially all of the issuer&#146;s assets and are guaranteed by the issuer&#146;s subsidiaries that guarantee its other credit facilities. in connection with the loan, the issuer agreed to issue to investor the warrants pursuant to the investment agreement (the &#147; investment agreement &#148;), dated as of march 29, 2011, by and between the issuer and investor, as amended on may 6, 2011.&#160; under the investment agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the reporting persons will not be permitted to transfer any of the warrants or any of the shares issued upon exercise thereof for a period of two years following the closing date (the &#147; transfer restrictions &#148;).&#160; in addition, the reporting persons are not permitted to enter into any hedging transactions with respect to the common stock for a period of one-year following the closing date (the &#147; hedging restrictions &#148;). under the investment agreement and the letter agreement, dated as of january 10, 2011, by and among the issuer, pf5 and ffa, subject to certain exceptions, for a two-year period following the closing date, the reporting persons are subject to customary &#147;standstill&#148; restrictions, pursuant to which the reporting persons will not be permitted to acquire additional shares of the issuer&#146;s capital stock or make certain proposals with respect to a merger, combination or acquisition (or take similar actions) with respect to the issuer (the &#147; standstill ,&#148; and together with the transfer restrictions and the hedging restrictions, collectively, the &#147; investment restrictions &#148;). 27 in addition, for the seven-year period following the closing date, the reporting persons (so long as they continue to hold the warrants) will be entitled to certain anti-dilution protections.&#160; in particular, if the issuer issues common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock at a price per share less than $2.55, the reporting persons will be entitled to receive additional warrants to acquire shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.01 per share in an amount up to 19.9% of the shares of common stock issued or issuable in such issuance.&#160; in addition to the foregoing anti-dilution protections, there are also customary anti-dilution adjustments to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.&#160; under the investment agreement, the reporting persons also have, subject to certain exceptions, preemptive rights which allow the reporting persons to purchase their proportionate share of any issuances of equity securities of the issuer or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for equity securities of the issuer.&#160; the issuance of securities pursuant to the foregoing anti-dilution protections and, under certain circumstances, the preemptive rights, is subject to the issuer obtaining shareholder approval, which the issuer has agreed to seek following the closing of the loan.&#160; in the event that the issuer consummates a transaction that triggers such anti-dilution protections or preemptive rights without first having obtained such shareholder approval, the per annum interest rate on the notes will increase by two percentage points, and thereafter increase by an additional two percentage points on each three-month anniversary of such transaction (subject to a maximum interest rate of 18%), and will remain at such rate until such shareholder approval is obtained and any securities issuable to the reporting persons pursuant to such anti-dilution protections or preemptive rights are issued. under the investment agreement, the reporting persons, subject to certain conditions, are entitled to designate one representative who will be permitted to attend all meetings of the issuer&#146;s board of directors, and all committees thereof, as a non-voting observer. the warrants were acquired for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business and for the purposes described below. the reporting persons will continuously evaluate the issuer&#146;s businesses and prospects, alternative investment opportunities and all other factors deemed relevant in determining whether to exercise any of the warrants, acquire additional shares of common stock or dispose of any of the warrants or shares of common stock held by the reporting persons.&#160; subject to the investment restrictions, the reporting persons may acquire additional shares of common stock or some or all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the reporting persons may be sold, in either case in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. other than as described in this schedule 13d, none of the reporting persons, and to the best of their knowledge, none of the covered persons has any current plans or proposals that would be related to or would result in any of the matters described in items 4(a)-(j) of schedule 13d;
