standstill limit &#148; is a number of shares equal to the investor maximum ownership percentage of the outstanding common stock. the &#147; investor maximum ownership percentage &#148; is 14 currently 60%. thereafter, with certain exceptions, upon the disposition by nxp or its affiliates of any common stock or issuer&#146;s other equity securities, the investor maximum ownership percentage shall be reduced to the percentage of issuer&#146;s outstanding voting stock beneficially owned by nxp and its affiliates immediately following such disposition. once reduced, the standstill limit shall never be increased following any subsequent disposition or acquisition of common stock or other event or transaction. the investor maximum ownership percentage shall never exceed 60%. the investor maximum ownership percentage will not be adjusted other than following dispositions of issuer&#146;s equity securities by nxp or its affiliates to persons other than nxp and the permitted transferees of the series b preferred stock;

as a condition to the investor&#146;s participation in such process, the board may require that the investor agree in writing with the company that if such process results in the board&#146;s approval of a change of control transaction with a person other than the investor that is a superior proposal as compared to any bona fide written proposal from the investor, then the investor will consent to such transaction, will raise no objection to the consummation thereof, and will tender shares of equity securities beneficially owned by it, as applicable, upon the consummation of such transaction.&#160; in the event that any such transaction requires the approval of the company&#146;s stockholders, the investor agrees, if the matter is brought to a vote at a stockholder meeting, that the investor will be present, in person or by proxy, as holders of voting stock, at all such meetings and be counted for determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings and will 17 vote for the approval of any such transaction approved and recommended by the board.&#160;

dgcl &#148;), including the approval of any transaction contemplated thereby that results in any &#147;affiliate&#148; or &#147;associate&#148; (as each such term is defined in section 203 of the dgcl) of the investor becoming an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; (as defined in section 203 of the dgcl) by virtue of the investor or its &#147;affiliates&#148; or &#147;associates&#148; owning any common stock acquired pursuant to the share exchange agreement or after the closing pursuant to section 3.1 of this agreement.&#160; accordingly, the ownership by the investor, its &#147;affiliates&#148; and its &#147;associates&#148; of common stock acquired pursuant to the share exchange agreement or after the closing pursuant to section 3.1 of this agreement will not result in the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl applicable to a &#147;business combination&#148; (as defined in section 203 of the dgcl) to apply between such persons (or their &#147;affiliates&#148; or &#147;associates&#148;) and the company. section 3.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the global collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to (i) restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers of collateral to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, (ii) cause to be placed on certificates for any or all of the pledged shares or the pledged debt or on any other securities pledged hereunder a legend to the effect that such security has not been registered under the securities act of 1933 and may not be disposed of in violation of the provision of said act, and (iii) impose such other limitations or conditions in connection with any such sale as the global collateral agent deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with said act or any other law, and, upon consummation of any such sale, the global collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold.&#160; each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of the pledgor, and the pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.&#160; the pledgor will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as the global collateral agent reasonably deems necessary or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law.&#160; the global collateral agent or any secured party shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of the collateral so sold, and the global collateral agent or such secured party may pay the purchase price by crediting the amount thereof against the secured obligations.

(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of an enforcement event, the global collateral agent may, in its sole discretion, cause any or all of the pledged shares to be transferred of record into the name of the global collateral agent or its nominee.&#160; the pledgor will promptly give to the global collateral agent copies of any notices or other communications received by it with respect to pledged shares registered in the name of the pledgor. (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the global collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral at any time after receipt in accordance with the provisions of the collateral agency agreement. (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the global collateral agent may exercise any and all rights and remedies of the pledgor in respect of the collateral. (f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; all payments received by the pledgor after the occurrence and during the continuance of an enforcement event in respect of the collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the global collateral agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of the pledgor and shall be forthwith delivered to the global collateral agent as collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement).
