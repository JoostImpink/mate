the purpose of raising proceeds to cover the reasonably estimated u.s. federal or state tax liability incurred by such individual equityholder as a result of the vesting, during the lock-up period, of restricted shares of common stock heretofore granted to such individual equityholder, provided each such disposition shall occur on or about the time of such vesting and shall be of an amount of shares of common stock that raises gross proceeds that, as nearly as reasonably practicable, approximate such tax liability. in addition, each of the individual equityholders shall, during the lock-up period, be entitled to establish a 10b5-1 plan for the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plan, provided that no sale of shares of common stock under such plan

caused by or contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided , however , that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 15b shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent

amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such holder of registrable securities were offered to the public (less underwriters&#146; discounts and commissions) exceeds the total amount of any damages which such holder of registrable securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of a violation by such holder. 30 15c. indemnification procedures . any person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification ( provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person&#146;s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not adversely affected the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified

this section 15 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable (other than pursuant to its terms) to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by the holder of registrable securities under this section 15 exceed the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such holder of registrable securities were offered to the public (less underwriters&#146; discounts and commissions) exceeds the total amount of any damages which such holder of registrable securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of a violation by such holder. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 15e. other indemnification provisions . the obligations of the company and the holders of registrable securities under this section 15 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this agreement, and otherwise. the indemnification
