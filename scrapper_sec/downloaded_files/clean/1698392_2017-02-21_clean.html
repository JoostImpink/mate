provided, however , that the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to (x) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 3(d) , (y) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. the company shall promptly notify the representative of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification of any of the registrable securities for sale under the securities or &#x201c;blue sky&#x201d; laws of any jurisdiction in the united states or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. &#xa0; (e) &#xa0; as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event or facts, the company shall notify the representative in writing of the happening of any event or existence of such facts as a result of which the prospectus included in any registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such registration statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver a copy of such supplement or amendment to the representative (or such other number of copies as the representative may reasonably request). the company shall also promptly notify the representative in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a registration statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective (notification of such effectiveness shall be delivered to the representative by email or facsimile on the same day of such effectiveness and by overnight mail), (ii) of any request by the sec for amendments or supplements to any registration statement or related prospectus or related information, and (iii) of the company&#x2019;s reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate. &#xa0; (f) &#xa0; the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of any registration statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any registrable securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify the representative of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose. &#xa0; (g) &#xa0; the company shall cause all the registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the company are then listed. the company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying such obligations. &#xa0; &#xa0; 4 &#xa0; (h) &#xa0; the company shall cooperate with the representative to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the registrable securities to be offered pursuant to any registration statement and enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts as the representative may reasonably request and registered in such names as the nextgen sellers may request, and upon sale, to not bear any restrictive legend. &#xa0; (i) &#xa0; the company shall at all times provide a transfer agent and registrar with respect to the registrable securities. &#xa0; (j) &#xa0; if reasonably requested by the representative, the company shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable, incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the representative believes should be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of registrable securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of registrable securities being sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the registrable securities; and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable upon notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment. &#xa0;

(l) &#xa0; the company shall take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by each nextgen seller of registrable securities pursuant to any registration statement. &#xa0; 4. obligations of the representative and the nextgen sellers . &#xa0; (a) &#xa0; the company shall notify the representative in writing of the information the company reasonably requires from each of the nextgen sellers in connection with any registration statement hereunder. the representative shall furnish to the company such information regarding each nextgen seller, the registrable securities held by each nextgen seller and the intended method of disposition of the registrable securities held by each nextgen seller as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such registrable securities and each nextgen seller shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the company may reasonably request. &#xa0; &#xa0; 5 &#xa0; (b) &#xa0; each nextgen seller agrees to cooperate with the company as reasonably requested by the company in connection with the preparation and filing of any registration statement hereunder. &#xa0; (c) &#xa0; each nextgen seller agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event or existence of facts of the kind described in the first sentence of section 3(e) , such nextgen seller will immediately discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to any registration statement(s) covering such registrable securities until such nextgen seller&#x2019;s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by the first sentence of section 3(e) . notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the company shall cause its transfer agent to promptly deliver shares of common stock of the company in connection with any sale of registrable securities with respect to which any nextgen seller has entered into a contract for sale prior to the nextgen seller&#x2019;s receipt of a notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in the first sentence of section 3(e) and for which such nextgen seller has not yet settled. &#xa0; 5. expenses of registration . &#xa0; the company shall pay and be responsible for any and all fees, costs, disbursements and expenses incidental to the company&#x2019;s performance of or compliance with the terms of this agreement, including, without limitation, the following: (i) all registration and filing fees, and any other fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made with the sec or finra, (ii)&#xa0;all fees and expenses relating to compliance with state securities or &#x201c;blue sky&#x201d;

(a) &#xa0; to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify, hold harmless and defend each nextgen seller, the members, directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives of each nextgen seller and each person, if any, who controls any nextgen seller within the meaning of the securities act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#x201c; exchange act &#x201d;) (each, an &#x201c; indemnified person &#x201d;), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs, attorneys&#x2019; fees, amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several (collectively, &#x201c; claims &#x201d;), incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the sec, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto (&#x201c; indemnified damages &#x201d;), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such claims arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement, prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. the company shall reimburse each indemnified person promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this section 6(a) shall not apply to a claim by an indemnified person to the extent such claim is based on an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission that is contained in any information furnished in writing to the company by any nextgen seller expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the applicable registration statement, prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. &#xa0; &#xa0; 6 &#xa0; (b) &#xa0; to the fullest extent permitted by law, each nextgen seller agrees to severally indemnify, hold harmless and defend, in the same manner as is set forth in section 6(a) , the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs a registration statement covering registrable securities, each underwriter, broker or other person acting on behalf of the holders of registrable securities and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing persons within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act (collectively and together with an indemnified person, an &#x201c; indemnified party &#x201d;), against any claim or indemnified damages to which any of them may become subject, under the securities act, the exchange act or otherwise, insofar as such claim or indemnified damages arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement, prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, occurring based on written information furnished to the company by such nextgen seller or the representative expressly for use in connection therewith; provided, however , that no nextgen seller shall be liable under this section 6(b) for the amount of any claim or indemnified damages that exceeds the net proceeds to such nextgen seller as a result of the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. &#xa0; (c) &#xa0; promptly after receipt by an indemnified person or indemnified party under this section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a claim, such indemnified person or indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 6 , deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the indemnified person or the indemnified party, as the case may be ; provided , however , that if any indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party which are additional to or conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, or that such claim or litigation involves or could have an effect upon matters beyond the scope of the indemnity agreement provided hereunder, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party (but shall have the right to participate therein with counsel of its choice) and such indemnifying party shall reimburse such indemnified party for that portion of the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the indemnified party which is reasonably related to the matters covered by the indemnity agreement provided hereunder . the indemnified party or the indemnified person, as the case may be, shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party or indemnified person, as the case may be, and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the indemnified party or indemnified person which relates to such action or claim. the indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party or indemnified person, as applicable, fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent, provided, however , that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party or indemnified person, as applicable, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party or indemnified person, as applicable, of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party or indemnified person, as applicable, under this section 6 , except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. &#xa0; &#xa0; 7 &#xa0; (d) &#xa0; the indemnification required by this section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or indemnified damages are incurred. &#xa0; (e) &#xa0; the indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the indemnified party or indemnified person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. &#xa0; 7. &#xa0; contribution . &#xa0; if the indemnification provided for hereunder is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any claim or indemnified damages, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claim or indemnified damages in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such claim or indemnified damages, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#x2019; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. no person guilty or liable of fraudulent misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any person. &#xa0; &#xa0; 8 &#xa0; 8. assignment of registration rights . &#xa0; the company shall not assign this agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the representative, except as permitted by the terms of the purchaser shareholders agreement and the purchase agreement. each nextgen seller may assign its rights hereunder to any purchaser or transferee of registrable securities, subject to the terms of the purchaser stockholders agreement and the purchase agreement; provided, however , no nextgen seller shall assign any of its rights hereunder to a person not already a party to this agreement as a nextgen seller unless and until such person executes and delivers to the company a joinder to this agreement, pursuant to which such person will thereupon become a party to, and be bound by and obligated to comply with the terms and provisions of this agreement as a nextgen seller hereunder. &#xa0;
