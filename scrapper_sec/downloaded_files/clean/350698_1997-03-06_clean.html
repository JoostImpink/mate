alvin swanner, as trustee ex-99.2 3 exhibit 2 escrow agreement ---------------- escrow agreement, dated february 24, 1997, among republic industries, inc., a delaware corporation ("republic"), and the stockholders (the "stockholders") of national car rental system, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), and akerman, senterfitt & eidson, p.a. as escrow agent (the "escrow agent"), and william e. lobeck, jr. as the representative of the stockholders (the "stockholders' representative"). w i t n e s s e t h: - - - - - - - - - - whereas, the stockholders are the record and beneficial owners of (i) all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the "company common stock"), par value $.01 per share, of the company and (ii) all of the issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the company (the "company preferred stock" and, together with the company common stock, the "company shares"); whereas, pursuant to a share exchange agreement, dated as of january 5, 1997, among republic, the company and the stockholders (the "agreement"), the stockholders are exchanging their company shares for shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of republic ("republic common stock"); whereas, pursuant to section 2.3 of the agreement, republic is to deposit in escrow certificates representing 2,164,194 shares of republic common stock to be issued pursuant to the agreement (such shares of republic common stock being hereinafter referred to as the "escrowed consideration") for the purpose of securing to republic the obligations of the stockholders under article x of the agreement; whereas, republic and each of the stockholders desire that the escrow agent serve as escrow agent to hold the escrowed consideration and the escrow agent is willing to do so, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. now, therefore, for $10.00 and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows: i. escrowed consideration. ---------------------- 1.1 each stockholder hereby authorizes republic to deliver to the escrow agent on behalf of such stockholder, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this escrow agreement, a stock certificate or certificates registered in the name of such stockholder representing its pro rata interest in the escrowed consideration as set forth on schedule i hereto (as to each stockholder, the "pro rata interest"); and each stockholder is delivering to the escrow agent a stock transfer power or powers executed by such stockholder in blank, to be held for use in connection with the shares of republic common stock to be included in the escrowed consideration. by execution of this agreement and of schedule i hereto, the escrow agent hereby acknowledges receipt of such certificates and stock powers. copies of the certificates evidencing the escrowed consideration are attached hereto as exhibits "a" and "b." 1.2 each stockholder hereby authorizes delivery directly to the escrow agent (and each agrees that it will deliver to the escrow agent if it shall first receive the same) all shares of republic common stock issued or issuable to such stockholder as a result of any stock dividend or stock split, with respect to the escrowed consideration. such additional shares shall be registered in the name of such stockholder, shall become part of the escrowed consideration and shall be treated as escrowed consideration hereunder with the same effect as if such shares had been delivered to the escrow agent simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this escrow agreement. 1.3 while any escrowed consideration is held in escrow hereunder, each stockholder will have all rights (including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends or distributions) with respect thereto in accordance with its pro rata interest of the escrowed consideration, except (a) the right of possession and (b) the right to receive any shares of republic common stock referred to in section 1.2 hereof. ii. delivery of escrowed consideration by escrow agent. -------------------------------------------------- the escrow agent shall hold the escrowed consideration in escrow until authorized hereunder to deliver the same or any portion thereof, as follows: 2.1 the escrow agent shall deliver to each stockholder on february 24, 1998 (the "expiration date") any escrowed consideration then held by it which is registered in the name of such stockholder unless and to the extent there then remains unresolved any pending claim or any dispute between republic and the stockholders' representative regarding any claim asserted pursuant to section 2.2 hereof, including any claim with respect to which the company has asserted a claim against general motors corporation pursuant to section 10.7 of the agreement, in which event any escrowed consideration remaining on deposit after each such claim shall have been determined, resolved and satisfied as set forth in articles iii and iv hereof shall be delivered to the stockholders promptly after the time of determination, resolution and satisfaction of such claim to the extent not subject to any other then remaining claims. no certificate or script representing fractional shares of the escrowed consideration shall be delivered to the stockholders, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of republic. in lieu of any such fractional shares, each stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of republic common stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $28.625; provided that, if following the date hereof the outstanding shares of republic common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the value of each share of republic common stock comprising the escrowed consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction. nothing stated in the previous sentence shall be construed as providing the stockholders any preemptive or antidilutive rights other than in the case of a stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapital- ization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction and, except in such case, there shall be no adjustment to the per share value of the republic common stock which comprises the escrowed consideration in the event that republic issues or agrees to issue any shares of republic common stock between the date hereof and the expiration date, whether for cash, through option grants, option or warrant exercises, in acquisitions, or in other transactions. 2.2 if at any time from the date hereof prior to the expiration date, republic has a reasonable good faith basis for asserting a claim for indemnifiable damages under the agreement, it shall give prompt written notice (an "indemnification notice") to the escrow agent (with a copy to the stockholders' representative) in the form of exhibit c attached hereto. upon receipt by the escrow agent of an indemnification notice, the escrow agent shall hold in escrow hereunder a portion of the escrowed consideration (pro rata in accordance with each stockholder's pro rata interest in the escrowed consideration) with a value (as determined below) equal to the amount of the claim set forth in indemnification notice and all other pending or disputed claims hereunder (or shall hold in escrow hereunder the entire escrowed consideration then in its possession if the value of the escrowed consideration then in its possession will not be sufficient to pay the full amount of all pending or disputed claims) and shall release such escrowed consideration or portion thereof (i) to the stockholders only in accordance with the provisions of section 2.1 hereof, or (ii) to republic only in accordance with the provisions of article iii and article iv hereof. for purposes of satisfying any claim for indemnifiable damages under the agreement made by republic or otherwise valuing the escrowed consideration hereunder, the shares of republic common stock shall be valued at $28.625 per share (subject to any adjustment described in the proviso in section 2.1 hereof). promptly after receipt of an indemnification notice, the escrow agent shall send to the stockholders' representative a second copy of such indemnification notice. 2.3 promptly after any determination of a claim in accordance with the provisions of article iii hereof, and promptly after any receipt of notice of the resolution of a disputed claim in accordance with the provisions of article iv hereof (which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of any agreement, final court order, judgment or decree evidencing such resolution), the escrow agent shall deliver to republic, free and clear of any interest of the stockholders therein, escrowed consideration, with a value (as determined below) equal to the amount, if any, of such claim payable to republic pursuant to such determination or resolution. such amount shall be charged pro rata against each stockholder's pro rata interest of the escrowed consideration. for purposes of satisfying any claim so determined or resolved for indemnifiable damages under the agreement made by republic or otherwise valuing the escrowed consideration hereunder, the shares of republic common stock shall be valued at $28.625 per share (subject to any adjustment described in the proviso in section 2.1 hereof). if the value (as determined under the preceding sentence) of the escrowed consideration then held by the escrow agent is less than the amount, if any, of such claim so payable, the escrow agent shall deliver to republic all of the escrowed consideration then held by it, free and clear of any interest of the stockholders therein, whereupon this escrow agreement shall terminate. iii. determination of claims. ----------------------- the determination of a claim for indemnifiable damages asserted under the agreement and against the escrowed consideration hereunder shall be made as follows: 3.1 the claim shall be deemed to have resulted in a determination in favor of republic, in an amount equal to the amount of such claim estimated by republic pursuant to section 2.2 hereof, on the 30th day after republic gives the escrow agent and the stockholders' representative the indemnification notice with respect to such claim pursuant to section 2.2 hereof, unless prior thereto the escrow agent has received notice from the stockholders' representative (with a copy to republic) that the stockholders have a reasonable good faith basis for disputing the claim in the form of exhibit d attached hereto (a "dispute notice"). promptly after receipt of any dispute notice, the escrow agent shall send republic a second copy of such dispute notice. 3.2 if a claim asserted hereunder is disputed by the stockholders' representative in the manner provided in section 3.1 hereof, the resolution of such disputed claim shall be made in accordance with the provisions for the settlement of disputes contained in article iv hereof and such resolution shall be evidenced by the documentation referred to in section 4.4 hereof. 3.3 (a) if the stockholders elect to undertake the defense of a claim in accordance with section 10.6(a) of the agreement, the stockholders' representative may from time to time deliver to the escrow agent (with a copy to republic) a notice in the form of exhibit e attached hereto (a "reimbursement notice"). promptly after receipt of a reimbursement notice, the escrow agent shall send to republic a second copy of such reimbursement notice. (b) if republic wishes to dispute such reimbursement notice, it shall so notify the escrow agent and the stockholders' representative in writing, providing a reasonable good faith basis for such dispute, in the form of exhibit f attached hereto (a "reimbursement dispute notice") within 30 days after the stockholders' representative gives the escrow agent and republic such reimbursement notice, in which case the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions for the settlement of disputes contained in article iv hereof and such resolution shall be evidenced by the documentation referred to in section 4.4 hereof. promptly after receipt of a reimbursement dispute notice, the escrow agent shall send to the stockholders' representative a second copy of such reimbursement dispute notice. (c) if republic fails to provide a reimbursement dispute notice within such 30-day period, or upon receipt of any instructions pursuant to section 4.4 hereof, the escrow agent shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 2.2 hereof, distribute to the stockholders' representative a portion of the escrowed consideration with a value (as determined below) sufficient to pay the full amount of the expenses set forth in such reimbursement notice, if not disputed, or resolved pursuant to article iv, if disputed. such distribution shall be made pro rata against each stockholder's pro rata interest in the escrowed consideration. for purposes of valuing the escrowed consideration hereunder, the shares of republic common stock shall be valued at $28.625 per share (subject to any adjustment described in the proviso in section 2.1 hereof). iv. settlement of disputes. ---------------------- if the stockholders' representative delivers a dispute notice in compliance with section 3.1 hereof, or republic delivers a reimbursement dispute notice in compliance with section 3.3(b) hereof, republic and the stockholders' representative shall follow the procedures set forth below: 4.1 promptly following receipt (i) by republic of a dispute notice or (ii) by the stockholders of a reimbursement dispute notice, the parties (other than the escrow agent) shall hold a meeting (the "initial meeting"), attended by persons with decision-making authority for each party, regarding the dispute, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute; provided, however, that no such meeting, or any statements made or documents exchanged by the parties at such meeting, shall be deemed to vitiate or reduce the obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder or under the agreement or be deemed a waiver by a party hereto of any remedies to which such party would otherwise be entitled hereunder or under the agreement. 4.2 if, within thirty (30) days after the initial meeting or such longer period as the parties (other than the escrow agent) may agree, the parties (other than the escrow agent) have not succeeded in negotiating a resolution of the dispute, the parties (other than the escrow agent) shall submit the dispute to mediation in accordance with the then-current cpr model mediation procedure for business disputes published by the cpr institute for dispute resolution (the "cpr"). in connection with such mediation, the parties (other than the escrow agent) shall jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator, seeking assistance in such regard from the cpr if they have been unable to agree upon such appointment within twenty (20) days from the conclusion of the negotiation period. the parties (other than the escrow agent) shall bear equally the out-of-pocket costs payable to third parties of the mediation; provided, however, that costs payable by a party to its advisors and other representatives, including its attorneys and any experts or consultants retained on its behalf, shall be borne solely by such party. such mediation shall be held in new york city unless the parties agree otherwise. 4.3 the parties (other than the escrow agent) shall participate in good faith in the mediation and negotiations related thereto for a period of no more than thirty (30) days from the date a mediator is appointed, unless such parties agree to extend such period. if the parties (other than the escrow agent) are not successful in resolving the dispute through the mediation, then any such party may institute legal proceedings to adjudicate such dispute, subject to the provisions of section 11.12 of the agreement. 4.4 the settlement or resolution of any dispute shall be evidenced to the escrow agent by notice and appropriate instructions as to disbursement of the escrowed consideration in writing to the escrow agent signed (i) by republic and the stockholders' representative or (ii) by either republic or the stockholders' representative certifying that attached thereto is a certified copy of a final judgment, order or decree of the united states district court for the district of delaware or a court of competent jurisdiction of the state of delaware or any appellate court thereof, and that the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected. a copy of such notice and instructions shall be sent to the stockholders' representative or republic, respectively. prior to the settlement or resolution of any dispute as provided in this article iv, the escrow agent shall retain in its possession such portion of the escrowed consideration which is the subject of the dispute. v. concerning the escrow agent. --------------------------- 5.1 the escrow agent shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for its services hereunder and shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred or made by it in performance of its duties hereunder. the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances shall be paid by republic upon request by the escrow agent from time to time. 5.2 the escrow agent may resign and be discharged from its duties hereunder at any time by giving notice of such resignation to republic and to the stockholders' representative specifying a date (not less than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice) when such resignation shall take effect. promptly after such notice, a successor escrow agent shall be appointed by mutual agreement of republic and the stockholders' representative, such successor escrow agent to become escrow agent hereunder upon the resignation date specified in such notice. the escrow agent shall continue to serve until its successor accepts the escrow and receives the escrowed consideration; provided, however, that, if no successor escrow agent -------- ------- is appointed prior to the date specified in the escrow agent's notice of resignation, the escrow agent shall be relieved of its duties hereunder and shall have the option to retain the escrowed consideration solely as a custodian or to interplead the escrowed consideration with a federal court of competent jurisdiction in dade county, florida. republic and the stockholders' representative may agree at any time to substitute a new escrow agent by giving notice thereof to the escrow agent then acting. 5.3 the escrow agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read herein against the escrow agent. the escrow agent shall not be bound in any way by, or be deemed to have knowledge of the terms of, the agreement or any other agreement among the parties hereto, the company, the stockholders or republic other than this escrow agreement. the escrow agent acting or refraining from acting in good faith shall not be liable for any mistake of fact or error of judgment by it or for any acts or omissions by it of any kind unless caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in doing so upon (a) any written notice, instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine, and (b) the advice of counsel (which may be of the escrow agent's own choosing). the escrow agent shall have no responsibility for the contents of any writing submitted to it hereunder and may assume the validity and accuracy of any statement or assertion contained in such a writing or instrument, and may assume that any person who gives any writing, notice, advice, or instructions in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. the escrow agent makes no representations and has no responsibility as to the validity, genuineness or sufficiency of any of the documents or instruments delivered to it, and shall be entitled in good faith to rely without any liability upon the contents thereof. 5.4 republic, on the one hand, and the stockholders, on the other hand, jointly and severally agree to indemnify the escrow agent and hold it harmless against any and all liabilities, expenses, claims, losses, actions, suits or proceedings, at law or in equity, incurred by it hereunder (including attorneys' fees) except for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances described in section 5.1 hereof and for liabilities incurred by the escrow agent resulting from its own wilful misconduct or gross negligence; provided that republic, on the one hand, and the stockholders, on the other hand, will be entitled to a right of contribution from the other if such liabilities result from the stockholders' actions (including the stockholders' representative's actions), or republic's actions, respectively. 5.5 if at any time escrow agent determines, in escrow agent's sole and absolute discretion, that there is a dispute concerning whether any of the escrowed consideration is to be released under this agreement or to whom the escrowed consideration is to be released, the interpretation of this escrow agreement, the rights and obligations of any of the parties hereunder, or about the propriety of any action contemplated by the escrow agent hereunder, the escrow agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, interplead the escrowed consideration in a federal court of competent jurisdiction in dade county, florida, and the escrow agent shall be fully indemnified by the parties hereto in accordance with section 5.4 hereof and shall also be deemed to be released from all obligations or liabilities under or with respect to this escrow agreement except to the extent resulting from the wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the escrow agent. 5.6 the parties acknowledge that akerman, senterfitt & eidson, p.a. is counsel to republic and agree that in the event of a dispute hereunder or with respect to the escrowed consideration, the parties shall not assert that akerman, senterfitt & eidson, p.a. is barred from representing itself and/or republic by reason of its dual status; provided, however, that akerman, senterfitt & eidson, p.a. shall not represent republic in connection with any dispute under this escrow agreement. 5.7 under no circumstances shall escrow agent have any liability hereunder on account of any loss suffered by republic or the stockholders as a result of the escrow agent failing to deliver any of the escrowed consideration in a timely manner except to the extent resulting from the escrow agent's wilful misconduct or gross negligence. vi. miscellaneous. ------------- 6.1 the stockholders, republic and the escrow agent acknowledge that santa anna holdings, inc. ("santa anna") intends to liquidate following the closing date, and hereby agree that following such liquidation each of the stockholders of santa anna shall become stockholders hereunder entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations hereunder (including the indemnification obligations of section 5.4 hereof) with the pro rata interest of santa anna to be divided among such santa anna
