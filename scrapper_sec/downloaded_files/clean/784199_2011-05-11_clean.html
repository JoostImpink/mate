the principal executive offices of cardiogenesis are located at cardiogenesis corporation, 11 musick, irvine, california, 92618. &#160; item 2. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; identity and background &#160; this schedule 13d is being jointly filed on behalf of cryolife,&#160;inc., a florida corporation ("cryolife"), and cl falcon, inc., a florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of cryolife ("cl falcon," and together with cryolife, the "reporting persons").&#160; the principal executive offices of each of the reporting persons are located at 1655 roberts blvd. n.w. kennesaw, georgia 30144.&#160; cryolife is an implantable biological medical device and cardiovascular tissue processing company.&#160; cl falcon was organized by cryolife to merge with cardiogenesis and therefore has not conducted any business to date. &#160; attached as schedule i , and incorporated herein by reference, is a list setting forth, with respect to each executive officer and director of cryolife and cl falcon, his or her name, residence or business address and present principal occupation or employment (along with the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted), in each case as of the date hereof. &#160; during the last five years, none of the reporting persons nor, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the persons named on schedule i , has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors). &#160; during the last five years, none of the reporting persons nor, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the persons named on schedule i , is or has been&#160;a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or has been found to have committed any violation with respect to such laws. &#160; to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, each executive officer and director of the reporting persons is a citizen of the united states. item 3. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; source and amount of funds or other consideration the reporting persons purchased the shares reported as directly owned in item 5 for a price of $0.457 per share in cash, or a total of $10,612,073, in the offer as described in item 4, using working capital of cryolife.&#160;&#160;pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in, the support agreement described in item&#160;4, the reporting persons may be deemed to have shared voting power with respect to 3,216,243 additional shares beneficially owned by the supporting shareholders (as defined in item 4) by virtue of entering into a support agreement with the supporting shareholders.&#160; the support agreement was entered into to induce cryolife and cl falcon to enter into the merger agreement, as defined in item 4 below, and proceed with the transactions contemplated thereby.&#160; neither cryolife nor cl falcon has paid any consideration to the supporting shareholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the support agreement described under item 4 of this schedule 13d. &#160; &#160; item 4. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction &#160; on march 28, 2011, cryolife, cl falcon and cardiogenesis entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which was amended and restated on april 14, 2011 (as amended, the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which cryolife, through cl falcon, offered to purchase for cash 49.9% of the outstanding shares of cardiogenesis common stock&#160;&#160;(the "offer").&#160;&#160;in the offer, cryolife, through cl falcon purchased shares for $0.457 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.&#160;&#160;as soon as practicable after completion of the offer, cryolife intends to merge cl falcon with and into cardiogenesis (the "merger").&#160;&#160;as a result of the merger, the separate corporate existence of cl falcon will cease and cardiogenesis will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;cusip no. 14159w-10-9&#160; &#160;page&#160;5 of 12 &#160; &#160; cryolife completed the offer on may 2, 2011.&#160;&#160;cryolife expects to complete the merger in middle to late may 2011. &#160; concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, paul mccormick, the executive chairman of cardiogenesis, richard p. lanigan, the executive vice president, marketing of cardiogenesis, and william r. abbott, the senior vice president, chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer of cardiogenesis, and each director of cardiogenesis, and their affiliates (the "supporting shareholders"), entered into a support agreement (the "support agreement") pursuant to which they agreed to tender into the tender offer an aggregate of 1,276,859 shares held by the supporting shareholders, and any shares acquired upon exercise of 1,939,384 stock options held by the supporting shareholders of cardiogenesis common stock, if so requested by cryolife.&#160;&#160;none of these shares were tendered into the offer.&#160;&#160;the support agreement also requires such shareholders to take certain other actions in connection with the merger agreement, including voting in favor of matters contemplated by the merger agreement at a meeting of cardiogenesis shareholders called to approve the merger.&#160;&#160;pursuant to the support agreement, cryolife also has an irrevocable proxy to vote the supporting shareholders' shares in favor of the merger. as a result, cryolife may be deemed to share voting rights with respect to these shares but does not own them, have any right to acquire them or have any pecuniary interest in or dispositive power with respect to them. &#160; under the california general corporation law, or cgcl, the approval of the cardiogenesis board and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding cardiogenesis shares, either pursuant to majority written consent or a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, may be required to approve the principal terms of the merger. the cardiogenesis board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and, the only remaining required corporate action of cardiogenesis is the approval of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote, or written consent, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding cardiogenesis shares. &#160; in the merger agreement, cardiogenesis agreed, if a shareholder vote was required, to convene a meeting of its shareholders following consummation of the offer for the purpose of considering and voting on the merger. cardiogenesis, acting through the cardiogenesis board, further agreed that, if a shareholders' meeting was convened, the cardiogenesis board would recommend that shareholders of cardiogenesis vote to approve the principal terms of the merger. at any such meeting, all of cardiogenesis shares then owned by cryolife and cl falcon and by any of cryolife's other subsidiaries, and all cardiogenesis shares for which cardiogenesis has received proxies to vote, will be voted in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger.&#160;&#160;cardiogenesis has prepared a proxy statement for a shareholders' meeting to be conducted during the week of may 16, 2011, and the proxy statement was mailed to cardiogenesis shareholders on may 6, 2011. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;upon the acceptance of payment of shares of cardiogenesis common stock pursuant to the offer, if cryolife so requests, cardiogenesis agreed to take all action reasonably necessary to cause cryolife's designees to be elected or appointed to cardiogenesis' board of directors, including, at cryolife's option, increasing the number of directors, so that cryolife will have representation on the cardiogenesis board in proportion to its share ownership.&#160;&#160;however, until the completion of the merger, cardiogenesis is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the cardiogenesis board of directors to maintain at least three directors who were members of the cardiogenesis board of directors as of march 28, 2011 and who are independent for purposes of rule 10a-3 of the act.&#160;&#160;cardiogenesis' obligations with respect to cryolife's board designees shall be subject to section 14(f) of the act and rule 14f-1 thereunder. cryolife also is entitled to appoint two individuals to serve as observers to the cardiogenesis board of directors.&#160;&#160;however, as of this time, cryolife has declined to exercise its rights to appoint directors or board observers. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;as of this time, cryolife does not intend to designate any directors or board observers.&#160;&#160;in the event that it changes that decision, it has not determined who will be its designees on the cardiogenesis board of directors. however, any such designees will be selected from a list of potential designees comprised of officers of cryolife, which officers are set forth in schedule i .&#160;&#160;if cryolife's designees are elected to cardiogenesis' board prior to the completion of the merger, the affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors will be required for cardiogenesis to, among other things, amend or terminate the merger agreement. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the purpose of the offer and merger is for cryolife and cl falcon to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, cardiogenesis. &#160; the offer, as the first step in the acquisition of cardiogenesis, facilitated the acquisition of 49.9% of the outstanding shares. the purpose of the merger is to acquire all outstanding shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the offer.&#160;&#160;cl falcon intends to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable. as an additional step in the merger transaction, cryolife intends to complete a second merger of cardiogenesis into another wholly owned subsidiary of cryolife, cryolife acquisition corporation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;cusip no. 14159w-10-9&#160; &#160;page 6 of 12 &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;at the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation of cl falcon and the by-laws of cl falcon, as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, will be the articles of incorporation and the by-laws of the surviving corporation, in each case with references to cl falcon therein automatically amended to become references to the surviving corporation (after the second merger referenced above), until thereafter amended as provided by law and such articles of incorporation and by-laws. the directors and officers of cl falcon will become the directors and officers of the surviving corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cryolife currently intends to operate the cardiogenesis business as a wholly-owned subsidiary.&#160;&#160;cryolife will continue to evaluate and review the cardiogenesis business, assets, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel with a view towards determining how to optimize any potential benefits and synergies that are created by the transaction and the integration of the operations of cardiogenesis with cryolife's business.&#160;&#160;more specifically, upon completion of its integration evaluation and implementation of final plans: &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(i)&#160;&#160; cryolife may transfer certain assets of cardiogenesis to its affiliates as part of its post&#8212;merger tax restructuring; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; (ii)&#160; cardiogenesis' principal executive offices likely will be combined with those of cryolife or its subsidiaries; and &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(iii)&#160;certain cardiogenesis functions likely will be relocated to new locations. &#160; cryolife intends to continue to review cardiogenesis' business, operations, capitalization and management. accordingly, cryolife reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate. &#160; cryolife expects that the shares of cardiogenesis common stock will cease to be quoted on otcqb as a result of the merger.&#160;&#160;the cardiogenesis shares of common stock are currently registered under the act. the purchase of the cardiogenesis shares pursuant to the merger will result in the shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the act. registration of the cardiogenesis shares may be terminated upon application to the sec if the outstanding shares are not listed on a "national securities exchange" and if there are fewer than 500 holders of record of shares of cardiogenesis common stock. cryolife intends to seek to cause cardiogenesis to apply for termination of registration of the cardiogenesis shares as soon as possible after approval of the merger, if the requirements for termination of registration are met. &#160; the foregoing summary descriptions of the merger agreement and support agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms of the merger agreement and support agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2 , respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; other than as described in this item 4, the reporting persons currently do not have any plans or proposals which relate to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a)-(j)&#160;of schedule 13d. item 5. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; interest in securities of the issuer (a)-(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; cl falcon directly owns 23,221,166 shares, which were purchased in the offer.&#160;&#160;cryolife, through its wholly owned subsidiary cl falcon, has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to these&#160;&#160;shares.&#160;&#160;in addition, as a result of the support agreement, based on information provided by the supporting shareholders, cryolife and cl falcon may be deemed to have shared voting power with respect to an aggregate of 3,216,243 shares (including a total of 1,939,384 options to purchase shares currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of may 2, 2011), representing 2.7% of the outstanding shares as of may 2, 2011 but they do not own them, have any right to acquire them or have any pecuniary interest in or dispositive power with respect to them.&#160; cryolife and cl falcon may be deemed to share with the supporting shareholders the power to vote such shares solely with respect to those matters described in item 4 of this schedule 13d and in the support agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference.&#160;
