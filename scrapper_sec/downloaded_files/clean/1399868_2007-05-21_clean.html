class a shares owned by each other reporting person. the reporting persons may be deemed to be part of a group together with rm, rm sub, the stronach trust, and 445327 and therefore deemed to

of any such shares. based on information provided in the company's latest publicly available reports and information provided by the major investors, the beneficial ownership of class a shares by the major investors is as set forth below: mr. stronach beneficially owns 100,000 class a shares that are subject to a fully vested and immediately exercisable option (the "option") that was issued to mr. stronach by the company on november 5, 1999 in partial consideration for his services as chairman of the company. the option is held directly by mr. stronach. mr. stronach acts as one of four trustees

("sun life") is the trustee of the magna deferred profit sharing plan (the "canadian dpsp"), which beneficially owns 4,013,472 class a shares (including 111,595 class a shares issuable upon conversion of an equivalent number of class b shares held by it). sun life has the power to vote the class a shares held by the canadian dpsp. however, as chairman of the company, mr. stronach has the right to direct sun life with respect to the voting and disposition of the class a shares held by the canadian dpsp. mr. stronach is a partner of stronach & co. ("s&co."), an entity that provides consulting services to certain subsidiaries of the company. s&co. holds options to purchase a total of 548,475 class a shares. mr. stronach, the stronach trust and 445327 do not admit that any of them beneficially owns any class a shares that are not held directly by such persons. without limitation of the foregoing, mr. stronach disclaims beneficial ownership of class a shares that are or may be deemed to be beneficially owned by s&co., the stronach trust, 445327, the company, 865714, the us dpsp or the canadian dpsp for purposes other than u.s. securities 9 law purposes. assuming the beneficial ownership of all such class a shares, (i) mr. stronach is the beneficial owner of 7,374,795 class a shares, representing 6.6% of the class a shares, (ii) the stronach trust is the beneficial owner of 818,569 class a shares, representing 0.7% of the class a shares and (iii) 445327 is the beneficial owner of 818,569 class a shares, representing 0.7% of the class a shares (in each case determined in accordance with rule 13d-3). item 6. contracts, arrangements, understanding or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement would be effected by way of a court approved plan of arrangement (the "plan of arrangement") under the laws of ontario, canada and is subject to court and regulatory approvals and, subject to court approval, the following shareholder approvals: o two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of the class a shares and class b shares represented at a shareholders meeting to be convened by the company, voting together;

o a majority of votes cast by holders of the class a shares represented at such shareholders meeting, excluding shares held by such "insiders," voting separately as a class; and o with respect only to the redemption and modification of the class b shares described below, a majority of the votes cast by holders of the class b shares represented at such shareholders meeting, excluding shares held by 445327, the reporting persons, and certain other parties deemed to be "interested" shareholders under applicable canadian law, voting separately as a class. completion of the transaction is also subject to finalizing definitive documentation and customary closing conditions. the transaction agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances before the effectiveness of the plan of arrangement, including (i) by mutual agreement of the company, rm and 445327, (ii) by the company on five days' notice or by either rm or 445327 if the company's board of directors fails to recommend, recommends against or withdraws, modifies or changes its approval or recommendation of the plan of arrangement in a manner adverse to rm, (iii) by the company, 445327 or rm if the certificate of arrangement has not been issued on or before october 31, 2007, or such later date as may be mutually agreed from time to time, or (iv) by rm if the company enters into certain transactions outside the ordinary course of business. pursuant to the transaction agreement, 445327 would, among other things, incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary ("446"), which would, in turn, incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary ("newco"). pursuant to the plan of arrangement, 445327 would transfer the 726,829 class b shares currently held by it to 446, which would in turn transfer such class b shares to newco in return for 420 class b shares of newco that would carry an approximately 53% voting interest and 42% dividend entitlement. the remainder of the share capital of newco would be divided such that (x) rm sub would hold 420 class c shares of newco that would carry an approximately 36% voting interest and 42% dividend entitlement (subject to certain contingencies and conditions) and (y) the reporting persons would hold in the aggregate, indirectly, 130 class a shares and 30 class d non-voting shares of newco that would represent in the aggregate an approximately 11% voting interest (shared equally as between mr. walker and mr. wolf only) and approximately a 16% dividend entitlement in newco. rm sub's interest in newco would be issued in consideration for us$76,830,000, constituting 5% of the "rm investment amount" (being us$1,536,600,000) and the interest of the reporting persons in newco would be issued in exchange for the transfer by the reporting persons to newco of 605,000 class a shares currently held by them. further to the plan of arrangement, newco would subscribe for 1,000,000 preferred shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary ("newco ii") for cash equal to 5% of the rm investment amount. newco would also own 100 10 voting shares of newco ii. rm sub would subscribe for 100 non-voting common shares of newco ii and loan to newco ii an amount equal to the canadian dollar equivalent of us$1,459,770,000, being 95% of the rm investment amount (the "newco ii loan"). newco ii would subscribe for 20,000,000 class a subordinate voting shares at a price equal to the rm investment amount using the proceeds of the newco ii loan and the newco ii subscription amount contributed to newco. as a result of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement, newco and newco ii would hold 20,605,000 class a shares and 726,829 class b shares, collectively representing approximately 56.9% of the total voting power of the class a shares and class b shares. if approved by the minority class b shareholders pursuant to a special vote of the class b shareholders pursuant to the plan of arrangement: (i) the company would acquire for cancellation all the outstanding class b shares other than those held by newco for cdn$114.00 in cash per class b share; and (ii) the number of votes per share attached to the class b shares would be reduced to 300 votes per class b share. as a consequence, newco and newco ii would control class a shares and class b shares collectively representing approximately 68.8% of the total voting power of the class a shares and class b shares. the 20,000,000 class a subordinate voting shares held by newco ii would be pledged by newco ii as security for the newco ii loan. rm sub is permitted to pledge some or all of the newco and newco ii shares held by it, as well as the newco ii loan and the 20,000,000 class a shares pledged to rm sub as security for the newco ii loan, to the person or persons providing financing to rm or rm sub in respect of the rm investment amount. as a result of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement, the shareholders of newco would share (pro rata to their respective equity interests) in any dividends received on the class a shares and the class b shares held by newco and newco ii. under the terms of the transaction agreement, at any time after the second anniversary of the effective date of the plan of arrangement, rm sub would have the right to sell its newco shares and any newco ii shares it holds to newco or its designee (the "rm exit right") for a purchase price that would result in rm sub receiving (a) the pre-tax value to newco ii of 20,000,000 class a shares up to the rm investment amount plus (b) 50% of the amount, if any, by which the pre-tax value to newco and newco ii of 20,000,000 class a shares exceeds the rm investment amount less (c) 25% of the tax incurred by newco and newco ii in connection with such buyback. in addition, at any time after the third anniversary of the effective date of the plan of arrangement, 446 would have the right to require rm sub to sell its newco shares and any newco ii shares it holds to newco or its designee (the "446 exit right") for a purchase price that would result in rm sub receiving (x) the pre-tax value to newco and newco ii of 20,000,000 class a shares up to the rm investment amount plus (y) the amount, if any, by which the pre-tax value to newco and newco ii of 20,000,000 class a shares exceeds the rm investment amount less (z) any tax incurred by newco and newco ii in connection with such buyback. in connection with the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement, rm sub entered into an agreement (the "european transaction agreement") whereby, on the effective date of the plan of arrangement, it would invest a net amount of us$150 million for a 50% interest in styria management limited, a european company that provides the consulting services of mr. stronach in relation to the company's business outside canada and austria. as a result of this investment, rm would be entitled to a 50% share of consulting fees paid by the company and its affiliates to s&co. and its affiliates under the existing arrangements. the completion of the transactions contemplated by the european transaction agreement is conditional upon the effectiveness of the plan of arrangement. newco governance under the transaction agreement, 446, rm, rm sub and the reporting persons would enter into certain agreements governing their relationship with respect to newco and newco ii and providing for the rm exit right, the 446 exit right and certain other matters. the terms of such agreements would specify, among other things, the following: o the board of directors of newco would consist of 6 directors: 2 nominees of 446 (including the chair), 2 nominees of rm sub and each of the co-chief executive officers of the company (being nominees of the reporting persons), provided that (i) if either of the co-chief executive officers ceases to serve as a newco director, unless 446 and rm sub otherwise agree, neither of the co-chief executive officers would be entitled to remain a 11 director of newco and the reporting persons would no longer be entitled to newco board representation and (ii) if either of the co-chief executive officers resigns as an executive officer of the company, unless 446 and rm sub otherwise agree, such co-chief executive officer would be entitled to continue to serve as a director of newco; o each of 446 and rm sub would have veto rights over all actions taken by newco and newco ii, other than voting in respect of the election or removal of directors of the company or newco ii (in accordance with the terms set out below); o 446 and rm sub would cause the class a shares and class b shares held by newco and newco ii to be voted to effect the following in respect of the company: o the company's board would consist of 14 directors: 6 nominees of 446 (including the chair), 6 nominees of rm sub and 2 nominees of the reporting persons (both co-chief executive officers of the company); o at least 4 nominees of each of 446 and rm sub must meet the independence requirements of applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules; o there would be governance guidelines that would provide that: (i) directors shall declare their interest and abstain from voting on all matters where there is an actual or perceived conflict, including, in the case of the reporting persons who are directors, the appointment of members to board committees or on any matter where 446 or rm sub have declared a conflict; and (ii) any material transaction "out of the ordinary course of business" (as such term is defined in the transaction agreement) shall require the support of two-thirds of the company's directors, where a transaction shall be deemed to be material if the transaction exceeds certain specified thresholds; o without the prior approval of the newco board of directors, neither rm sub nor 446 (nor their respective affiliates nor their shareholders) would be permitted to acquire any additional shares of the company, excluding class a shares which, when added to the class a shares held or controlled by newco, newco ii and their shareholders (after giving effect to the exercise of any options held by them), would not exceed 20% in aggregate of the class a shares outstanding; and o the board of directors of newco ii would be the same as the board of directors of newco, unless otherwise agreed to by the newco board of directors. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. the following documents are being filed as exhibits to this statement and are incorporated herein by reference: exhibit a joint filing agreement exhibit b transaction agreement dated may 10, 2007 (incorporated by reference from exhibit c to the schedule 13d/a filed on may 14, 2007 by frank stronach, the stronach trust and 445327 ontario limited). 12 signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of the undersigneds' knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. dated: may 18, 2007 siegfried wolf /s/ siegfried wolf ------------------------- donald j. walker /s/ donald j. walker ------------------------- vincent j. galifi /s/ vincent j. galifi ------------------------- peter koob /s/ peter koob ------------------------- jeffrey o. palmer /s/ jeffrey o. palmer ------------------------- the original statement shall be signed by each person on whose behalf the statement is filed or his authorized representative. if the statement is signed on behalf of a person by his authorized representative (other than an executive officer or general partner of this filing person), evidence of the representative's authority to sign on behalf of such person shall be filed with the statement, provided, however, that a power of attorney for this purpose which is already on file with the commission may be incorporated by reference. the name and any title of each person who signs the statement shall be typed or printed beneath his signature. attention: intentional misstatements or omissions of fact constitute federal criminal violations (see 18 u.s.c. 1001). 13 exhibit a joint filing agreement the undersigned hereby agree jointly to prepare and file with regulatory authorities a statement on schedule 13d reporting each of the undersigned's beneficial ownership of the class a subordinate voting shares of magna international inc. and hereby affirm that such statement on schedule 13d is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned in accordance with rule 13d-1(k)(1) under the securities exchange act of 1934. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. dated: may 18, 2007 siegfried wolf /s/ siegfried wolf ------------------------- donald j. walker /s/ donald j. walker ------------------------- vincent j. galifi /s/ vincent j. galifi ------------------------- peter koob /s/ peter koob ------------------------- jeffrey o. palmer /s/ jeffrey o. palmer ------------------------- 14 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
