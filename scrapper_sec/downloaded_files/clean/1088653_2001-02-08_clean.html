(b) an "exercise event" shall occur for purposes of this agreement upon the occurrence of any event that would entitle grantee to the payment of the termination fee in accordance with section 8.05(b) of the merger agreement. e-1 (c) in order to exercise the stock option, grantee shall send a written notice (the "stock exercise notice") to issuer specifying (i) the total number of option shares grantee wishes to purchase, (ii) the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing such option shares that grantee wishes to receive and (iii) a date (subject to the earlier satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in section 1.03) (a "closing date"), which shall be a business day which is not later than five (5) business days and not earlier than two (2) business days after delivery of the stock exercise notice, and place for the closing of such purchase (a "closing"). (d) any time the stock option is exercisable pursuant to the terms of section 1.02(a), grantee may elect, in lieu of exercising the stock option to purchase option shares as provided in section 1.02(a), to send a written notice to issuer (the "cash exercise notice") specifying a date not later than fifteen (15) business days and not earlier than five (5) business days after delivery of the cash exercise notice, on which date issuer shall pay to grantee an amount in cash (the "cash exercise amount") equal to the spread (as defined below) multiplied by such number of option shares as grantee shall specify in the cash exercise notice (a "cash exercise"). as used in this agreement, "spread" shall mean the excess, if any, over the purchase price of the higher of (x) if applicable, the highest price per share of issuer common stock paid or to be paid by any person in a competing transaction (the "competing purchase price") and (y) the closing price of the shares of issuer common stock on the nasdaq national market ("nasdaq") on the last trading day immediately prior to the date of the cash exercise notice (for purposes of this section 1.02) or the repurchase notice (for purposes of section 6.01) (the "closing price"). if the competing purchase price includes any property other than cash, the competing purchase price shall be the sum of (i) the fixed cash amount, if any, included in the competing purchase price plus (ii) the fair market value of such other property. if such other property consists of securities with an existing public trading market, the average of the closing prices (or the average of the closing bid and asked prices if closing prices are unavailable) for such securities in their principal public trading market on the thirty trading days ending five days prior to the date of the cash exercise notice (for purposes of this section 1.02) or the repurchase notice (for purposes of section 6.01) shall be deemed to equal the fair market value of such property. if such other property consists of something other than cash or securities with an existing public trading market and, as of the payment date for the spread, agreement on the value of such other property has not been reached, the competing purchase price shall be deemed to be the amount of any cash included in the competing purchase price plus the fair market value of such other property (as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm jointly selected by grantee and issuer). the parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause any determination of the fair market value of such other property to be made within three (3) business days after the date of delivery of the cash exercise notice (for purposes of this section 1.02) or the repurchase notice (for purposes of section 6.01). upon a cash exercise by grantee pursuant to this section 1.02(d), the obligations of issuer to deliver option shares pursuant to section 1.03 shall be terminated with respect to such number of option shares subject to the cash exercise notice. section 1.03 conditions to closing. the obligation of issuer to deliver option shares or pay the cash exercise amount, as applicable, upon any exercise of the stock option is subject to the conditions that: (a) all waiting periods, if any, under the hsr act applicable to the issuance of option shares shall have expired or have been terminated, and all consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, any governmental body, agency, official or authority, if any, required in connection with the issuance of option shares, the failure of which to have obtained or made would have the effect of making the issuance of option shares illegal, shall have been obtained or made, as the case may be; and (b) there shall be no preliminary or permanent injunction or other final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction preventing or prohibiting such exercise of the stock option, the delivery of the option shares or payment of the cash exercise amount in respect of such exercise. e-2 section 1.04 closings. at each closing pursuant to section 1.02(c), issuer shall deliver to grantee a certificate or certificates evidencing the applicable number of option shares (in the denominations specified in the stock exercise notice), and grantee shall purchase each such option share from issuer at the purchase price. at each closing pursuant to section 1.02(d), issuer shall deliver to grantee cash in an amount determined pursuant to section 1.02(d). all payments made pursuant to this agreement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by grantee to issuer. upon delivery by grantee to issuer of the stock exercise notice and the tender of the applicable cash as described above in this section 1.04, grantee shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of issuer common stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of issuer common stock shall not then be actually delivered to grantee or that issuer shall have failed to designate the bank account described above in this section 1.04. certificates evidencing option shares delivered hereunder may, at issuer's election, contain the following legend: the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom. the shares are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement dated as of january 29, 2001 between ariba, inc. and agile software corporation, a copy of which may be obtained from issuer upon request. in addition, the certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by applicable law. issuer shall, upon the written request of the holder thereof, issue such holder a new certificate evidencing such option shares without such legend in the event (i) such option shares have been registered pursuant to the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), (ii) such option shares have been sold in reliance on and in accordance with rule 144 under the securities act or (iii) such holder shall have delivered to issuer an opinion of counsel, which opinion shall, in issuer's reasonable judgment, be satisfactory in form and substance to issuer, to the effect that subsequent transfers of such option shares may be effected without registration under the securities act. section 1.05 adjustments upon share issuances, changes in capitalization, etc. (a) in the event of any change in issuer common stock or in the number of outstanding shares of issuer common stock by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction or any other extraordinary change in the corporate or capital structure of issuer (including, without limitation, the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend of cash, securities or other property), the type and number of shares or securities to be issued by issuer upon exercise of the stock option shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that grantee shall receive upon exercise of the stock option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that grantee would have received in respect of issuer common stock if grantee had exercised the stock option immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable, and had elected (to the fullest extent it would have been permitted to elect) to receive such securities, cash or other property. (b) if, during the term of this agreement, the issuer enters into an agreement (other than the merger agreement) (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person other than grantee or any grantee subsidiary, and issuer shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or any grantee subsidiary, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of issuer common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of issuer or any other person or cash or any other property or then outstanding shares of issuer common stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the surviving corporation or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of issuer's assets to any person, e-3 other than grantee or any grantee subsidiary, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that grantee shall receive upon exercise of the stock option the number and class of shares or other securities or property that grantee would have received in respect of issuer common stock if grantee had exercised the stock option immediately prior to such transaction or the record date therefor, as applicable, and had elected (to the fullest extent it would have been permitted to elect) to receive such securities, cash or other property. (c) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in no event shall the total number of option shares exceed nineteen and nine-tenths percent (19.9%) of the total number of shares of issuer common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this agreement. (d) the provisions of this agreement, including, without limitation, sections 1.01, 1.02, 1.04, 4.01, 4.02, 6.01, 6.04, 7.01 and 7.03, shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any securities for which the stock option becomes exercisable pursuant to this section 1.05. article ii representations and warranties of issuer issuer hereby represents and warrants to grantee as follows: section 2.01 authority relative to this agreement. issuer is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware. the execution, delivery and performance by issuer of this agreement and the consummation by issuer of the transactions contemplated hereby are within issuer's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. this agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by issuer and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by grantee, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of issuer enforceable against issuer in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). section 2.02 authority to issue shares. issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof until its obligation to deliver shares of issuer common stock upon the exercise of the stock option terminates, shall have reserved, all the option shares issuable pursuant to this agreement, and issuer shall take all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and permit it to issue all additional shares of issuer common stock or other securities which may be issued pursuant to section 1.05, all of which, upon their issuance and delivery in accordance with the terms of this agreement, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. section 2.03 no conflict; required filings and consents.

(a) following the exercise of the stock option, grantee may by written notice (the "registration notice") to issuer request the grantee to register under the securities act all or any part of the option shares beneficially owned by such grantee (such option shares to be registered being the "requested shares") pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment underwritten public offering, in which the grantee and the underwriters shall effect as wide a distribution of such option shares as is reasonably practicable and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any person (including any "group" as used in rule 13d-5 under the exchange act)) and its affiliates from purchasing through such offering restricted e-6 shares representing more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock on a fully diluted basis (a "permitted offering"). (b) the registration notice shall include a certificate executed by the grantee and its proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing (the "manager"), stating that (i) they have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering, and (ii) the manager in good faith believes that, based on the then-prevailing market conditions, it is reasonably likely to be able to sell the requested shares to the public in a permitted offering within one hundred twenty (120) days at a per share price equal to at least eighty percent (80%) of the average of the last sale prices per share of the issuer common stock on the nasdaq national market for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date of the registration notice (such ten-day average price being the "fair market value"). (c) the issuer (and/or any person designated by the issuer) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to the grantee within five (5) business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all of the requested shares proposed to be so sold for cash at a price equal to the product of (i) the number of requested shares and (ii) the then fair market value of such shares. (d) any purchase of requested shares by the issuer (or its designee) under section 4.02(c) shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the issuer or at the offices of its counsel as promptly as practicable but in any event at within ten (10) business days after delivery of such notice, and any payment for the shares to be so purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing in immediately available funds. (e) if the issuer does not elect to exercise its option pursuant to section 4.02(c) with respect to all requested shares, it shall use its best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the requested shares; provided, however, that (i) neither party shall be entitled to demand more than an aggregate of two (2) effective registration statements hereunder, and (ii) the issuer will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed forty (40) days) when (a) the issuer is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (b) the issuer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other transaction involving the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries and that such transaction is material to the issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. if consummation of the sale of any option shares pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effectiveness of the initial registration statement, the provisions of this section 4.02 shall again be applicable to any proposed registration. (f) the issuer shall use its best efforts to cause any option shares registered pursuant to this section 4.02 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the grantee may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that the issuer shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. (g) if issuer at any time after the exercise of the stock option proposes to register any shares of issuer common stock under the securities act in connection with an underwritten public offering of such issuer common stock, issuer will promptly give written notice to grantee of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of grantee given within twenty (20) days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of issuer common stock intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by grantee), issuer will cause all such shares for which grantee requests participation in such registration, to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that issuer may elect (i) not to cause any such shares to be so registered in the case of a registration solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration statement filed on form s-4 of the securities act (or any successor form thereto) or (ii) to reduce the number of shares to be registered e-7 if the underwriters in good faith object for valid business reasons; provided further, that the issuer may make an election pursuant to clause (ii) no more than two times. grantee shall not be entitled to exercise any right provided for in this section 4.02(g) after five (5) years following the first exercise of the stock option or such earlier time at which all option shares held by grantee can be sold in any three (3)-month period without registration in compliance with rule 144 of the securities act. (h) the registration rights set forth in this section 4.02 are subject to the condition that the grantee shall provide the issuer with such information with respect to its option shares, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to the grantee as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the issuer, is necessary to enable the issuer to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. (i) if the issuer common stock is registered pursuant to the provisions of this section 4.02, issuer agrees (i) to furnish copies of the registration statement and prospectus relating to the option shares covered thereby in such numbers as grantee may from time to time reasonably request and (ii) if any event shall occur as a result of which it becomes necessary to amend or supplement any registration statement or prospectus, to prepare and file under the applicable securities laws such amendments and supplements as may be necessary to keep available for such time as the distribution contemplated by such registration statement is complete a prospectus covering the issuer common stock meeting the requirements of such securities laws, and to furnish grantee such numbers of copies of the registration statement and prospectus as amended or supplemented as may reasonably be requested by grantee. (j) a registration effected under this section 4.02 shall be effected at the issuer's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and the expenses of counsel to the grantee, and the issuer shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as is customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. (k) in connection with any registration effected under this section 4.02, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner, (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary for transactions of such type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering, and (iii) to take all further actions which shall be reasonably necessary to effect such registration and sale (including if the manager deems it necessary, participating in road-show presentations). (l) the issuer shall be entitled to include (at its expense) additional shares of its common stock in a registration effected pursuant to section 4.02(a) only if and to the extent the manager determines that such inclusion will not adversely affect the prospects for success of such offering. article v investment intent section 5.01 grantee shall acquire the option shares for investment purposes only and not with a view to any distribution thereof in violation of the securities act, and shall not sell any option shares purchased pursuant to this agreement except in compliance with the securities act and applicable state securities and "blue sky" laws. article vi repurchase election section 6.01 repurchase. at the request of and upon notice to issuer ("repurchase notice"), at any time during the period during which the stock option is exercisable pursuant to section 1.02(b), issuer (or any successor entity thereof) must pay to grantee the repurchase fee (as defined below) upon delivery by e-8 grantee of the shares of issuer common stock acquired hereunder in accordance with section 1.02 with respect to which grantee then has beneficial ownership. the date on which grantee delivers the repurchase notice under this section 6 is referred to as the "repurchase request date". the "repurchase fee" shall be equal to the sum of the following: (a) the aggregate purchase price paid by grantee to issuer in accordance with section 1.02 for any shares of issuer common stock acquired pursuant to the stock option with respect to which grantee then has beneficial ownership; and (b) the spread, multiplied by the number of shares of issuer common stock with respect to which the stock option has been exercised and with respect to which grantee then has beneficial ownership. section 6.02 repurchase payment. subject to section 6.03, if grantee exercises its rights under this section 6, within five (5) business days after the repurchase request date, (i) issuer shall pay by wire transfer to grantee the repurchase fee in immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by grantee to issuer, and (ii) grantee shall surrender to issuer certificates representing the shares of issuer common stock acquired hereunder with respect to which grantee then has beneficial ownership, and grantee shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever. section 6.03 limitation on repurchase. issuer shall use its best efforts to ensure that it can fully perform all of its obligations under this section 6 under applicable law. if issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the option shares contemplated by this section 6 in full, issuer will promptly so notify grantee, repurchase the maximum possible number of option shares allowed under applicable law and as soon as practicable thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to grantee the portion of the repurchase fee that it is no longer prohibited from delivering. section 6.04 repurchase at the election of issuer.
