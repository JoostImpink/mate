(f/k/a firstlink communications, inc.) 1. designation. there is hereby provided for a single series of convertible preferred stock, the designation of which shall be the series a convertible preferred stock (hereinafter the "series a preferred stock") and the number of authorized shares constituting the series a preferred stock is 1,700,000. the stated value of each share of series a preferred stock is twenty-five dollars ($25.00). the number of authorized shares of series a preferred stock may be reduced or increased by a further resolution duly adopted by the board of directors of the corporation and by the filing of an amendment to the corporation's articles of incorporation pursuant to the provisions of the oregon business corporation act stating that such reduction or increase has been so authorized. 2. voting. except as required by law, the shares of the series a preferred stock shall not have any voting powers, either general or special, except as provided in this section 2: (a) subject to section 2(b), holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to vote on any matter on which the holders of the corporation's common stock (hereafter, the "common stock") are entitled to vote (except for the election of directors which is governed by section 2(b)) and the votes of the series a preferred stock shall be counted together with the holders of the common stock as a single class. the series a preferred stock shall vote with the whole number of shares of common stock as if the series a preferred stock had been fully converted pursuant to section 4 hereof three (3) business days prior to the date of the vote. any corporate action that may require a vote of the holders of the series a preferred stock as a class shall be deemed to have been approved by that class upon the affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding series a preferred stock unless a higher voting requirement is imposed by the oregon business corporation act. (b) prior to each annual meeting of stockholders, each of agl investments no. 8 limited partnership, a colorado limited partnership ("amstar"), aspen foxtrot investments, llc ("aspen"), gmac commercial mortgage corporation ("gmaccmc") and peregrine capital, inc. ("peregrine") shall individually have the right to nominate one of the seven directors (the "preferred directors"). the preferred directors shall be elected by the holders of the series a preferred stock (which for the purposes of this paragraph shall include common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock) voting together as a class and separately from all other classes and series. if at any time the number of directors on the board is increased or decreased, the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to nominate and elect a majority of such number. unless otherwise required by law, in case of any vacancy occurring among the preferred directors, the holder nominating such preferred director may appoint a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of the preferred director whose place shall be vacant. if any of amstar, aspen, gmaccmc or peregrine or any of their respective affiliates, shareholders, partners, or members to whom series a preferred stock may be transferred cease to own series a preferred stock or common stock equal in the aggregate to 25% of the number of shares of series a preferred stock, on a fully converted basis, that such person holds as of the effective date of this certificate, then such person shall no longer have the right to nominate a preferred director and the number of preferred directors shall be reduced accordingly and the number of directors to be elected by the holders of common stock shall be increased by the same number. (c) subject to section 10 herein, the board of directors without the vote of the holders of shares of the series a preferred stock may authorize and issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock ranking junior as to dividends and upon liquidation to the shares of the series a preferred stock. no class or series of equity securities of the corporation may rank senior to or equal in right with the series a preferred stock as to dividends or upon liquidation except for the series b convertible preferred stock (the "series b preferred stock" and, together with the series a preferred stock, the "preferred stock") which shall be equal in right. (d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 554(3) of the oregon business corporation act, the holders of the series a preferred stock shall be entitled to dissenters' rights pursuant to, and to the fullest extent permitted by, section 554(1) of said oregon business corporation act in the event of a merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the corporation. 3. dividends. (a) rate. holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, out of any funds of the corporation legally available for that purpose, cumulative dividends from the date of issuance at the rate of 12% per year of the liquidation preference (as defined in section 5(a)below), for each calendar quarter (pro-rated for partial quarters, based upon a 90 day quarter of three 30 day months) (each such calendar quarter, a "dividend period") payable in arrears in cash, or, at the option of the corporation, in shares of its common stock (with cash in lieu of fractional shares) based on the determination of fair value (defined in section 4(e)(viii) below), on the last day of december, march, june and september of each year, commencing december 31, 1999 (each such date being hereinafter individually referred to as the "dividend payment date" and collectively as the "dividend payment dates") provided, that no regulated stockholder (as defined in section 4(a)(iv) below) shall be required to receive any shares of common stock pursuant to this section 3(a) to the extent that immediately prior to payment of such dividend, or as a result of such dividend, the number of shares of common stock which constitute restricted stock (as defined in section 4(a)(iv) below) held by all holders thereof would exceed the number of shares of common stock which such regulated stockholder reasonably determines it and its affiliates (defined in section 4(a)(iv) below) may own, control or have the power to vote under any law, regulation, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at the time applicable to such regulated stockholder or its affiliates and such regulated stockholder shall be entitled to receive cash in lieu of such dividend payable in shares of common stock. should the corporation in its discretion determine to pay said dividends in shares of common stock for any dividend period, then all such accrued and unpaid dividends shall be paid in shares of common stock at the first to occur of the next dividend payment date or the time of conversion of the series a preferred stock, such that upon such dividend payment date or such conversion of the series a preferred stock by the holder thereof, the corporation shall pay all accrued and unpaid dividends owed for such dividend period as of the date of such conversion on all then converted shares. each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of the series a preferred stock as they appear on the books of the corporation on the record date which shall be not less than 30 days prior to the related dividend payment date. additional dividends, at an annual rate of 12%, shall accrue in respect of, and compound on, any dividends in arrears and may be payable at any time at the discretion of the corporation. (b) dividends on common stock. no dividends (other than those payable solely in common stock) shall be paid with respect to the common stock or any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock, which shall be pari passu with the series a preferred stock with respect to dividends, during any fiscal year of the corporation unless all due and unpaid dividends and the annual current dividend on the shares of series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock for the then current and all prior dividend periods shall have been declared and paid in cash. if dividends are paid partly in cash and partly in common stock with respect to the common stock or any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock, then all due and unpaid dividends and the annual current dividend on the shares of series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock for the then current dividend period and all prior dividend periods shall have been declared and paid either in cash or in the same proportion of cash and common stock proposed to be paid to holders of common stock and any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock; provided, that no regulated stockholder shall be required to receive any shares of common stock pursuant to this section 3(b) to the extent that immediately prior to payment of such dividend, or as a result of such dividend, the number of shares of common stock which constitute restricted stock held by all holders thereof would exceed the number of shares of common stock with such regulated stockholder reasonably determines it and its affiliates may own, control or have the power or vote under any law, regulation, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at the time applicable to such regulated stockholder or its affiliates and such regulated stockholder shall be entitled to receive cash in lieu of such dividend payable in shares of common stock. no shares of common stock or any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock shall be purchased, redeemed or acquired by the corporation, and no funds shall be paid into or set aside or made available for a sinking fund for the ex 99.2 - 2 purchase, redemption or acquisition thereof except in transactions with employees of the corporation aggregating not more than $100,000.00 per year. (c) limitation on amount of dividends. holders of shares of the series a preferred stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full dividends for each dividend period (including any dividends in arrears as provided herein), as herein provided, on the series a preferred stock. no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or dividend payments which may be in arrears. (d) parity of dividend payments. when dividends are not paid in full upon the series a preferred stock and the shares of any other series of capital stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the series a preferred stock, all dividends declared upon the series a preferred stock and such other series shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the series a preferred stock and such other series of capital stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that full dividends, for the then-current and all prior dividend periods, per share on the series a preferred stock and full dividends, including required or permitted accumulations, if any, on such other series of capital stock, bear to each other. 4. conversion. the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the "conversion rights"): (a) automatic conversion; optional conversion; conversion price. (i) automatic conversion. beginning july 21, 2001, each share of the series a preferred stock, without any action or payment of additional consideration on the part of the holder thereof, on the earliest of (1) the closing of a firm commitment public offering after such date pursuant to which the corporation offers its equity securities for gross proceeds to the corporation in an amount equal to or greater than $40,000,000, (2) the day that the closing sales price of the common stock on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market is equal to or greater than $10.00 per share for 15 consecutive trading days (taking into account any stock split or reverse stock split or any other adjustments to the number of shares of common stock outstanding after july 21, 1999, the "reference date"), or (3) the seventh anniversary of the reference date; provided that if the common stock is then trading at more than $2.00 per share, taking into account any stock split or reverse stock split or any other adjustments to the number of shares of common stock outstanding after the reference date, shall convert automatically as provided in section 4(j) into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock (with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares), having the powers, relative participating rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of holders of common stock as set forth in the corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws, at the conversion price (as defined below); provided, that no regulated stockholder shall be required to convert any shares of its series a preferred stock into common stock pursuant to this section 4(a) to the extent that immediately prior thereto, or as a result of such conversion, the number of shares of common stock which constitute such restricted stock held by all holders thereof would exceed the number of shares of common stock which such regulated stockholder reasonably determines it and its affiliates may own, control or have the power to vote under any law, regulation, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at the time applicable to such regulated stockholder or its affiliates. (ii) optional conversion. at any time, holders of series a preferred stock may elect to convert, in whole or in part, their series a preferred stock into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock (with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) at the conversion price by following the procedures set forth in section 4(j) hereof; provided, however, that series a preferred stock constituting restricted stock may not be converted into common stock to the extent that immediately prior thereto, or as a result of such conversion, the number of shares of common stock which constitute such restricted stock held by all holders thereof would exceed the number of shares of common stock which such regulated stockholder reasonably determines it and its affiliates may own, control or have the power to vote under any law, regulation, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at the time applicable to such regulated stockholder or its affiliates; and, provided, further, that each holder of series a preferred stock may convert such shares into common stock if such holder reasonably believes that such converted shares will be transferred within fifteen (15) days or already have been transferred pursuant to a conversion event (defined below) and such holder agrees not to vote any such shares of common ex 99.2 - 3 stock prior to such conversion event and undertakes to promptly convert such shares back into series a preferred stock if such shares are not transferred pursuant to a conversion event. each regulated stockholder may provide for further restrictions upon the conversion of any shares of restricted stock by providing the corporation with signed, written instructions specifying such additional restrictions and legending such shares as to the existence of such restrictions. (iii) conversion price. the "conversion price" shall initially be $2.00 per share. the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion is the liquidation preference divided by the then applicable conversion price, as adjusted from time to time as provided for in section 4(e), multiplied by the number of shares of series a preferred stock converted. notwithstanding any provision of this section 4(a)(iii) to the contrary, each holder of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to convert shares of series a preferred stock in connection with any conversion event if such holder reasonably believes that such conversion event will be consummated, and a written request for conversion from any holder of series a preferred stock to the corporation stating such holder's reasonable belief that a conversion event shall occur shall be conclusive and shall obligate the corporation to effect such conversion in a timely manner so as to enable each such holder to participate in such conversion event. the corporation will not cancel the shares of series a preferred stock so converted before the 15th day following such conversion event and will reserve such shares until such 15th day for resistance in compliance with the next sentence. if any shares of series a preferred stock are converted into shares of common stock in connection with a conversion event and such shares of common stock are not actually distributed, disposed of or sold pursuant to such conversion event, such shares of common stock shall be promptly converted back into the same number of shares of series a preferred stock. (iv) defined terms. for purposes of this certificate of designations, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: 1. "affiliate" shall mean with respect to any person, any other person, directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person. for the purpose of the above definition, the term "control" (including with correlative meaning, the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to any person, shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities or by contract or otherwise. 2. "conversion event" shall mean (a) any public offering or public sale of securities of the corporation (including a public offering registered under the securities act of 1933 and a public sale pursuant to rule 144 of the securities and exchange commission or any similar rule then in force), (b) any sale of securities of the corporation to a person or group of persons (within the meaning of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 act")) if, prior to such sale, such person or group of persons in the aggregate would own or control securities which possess in the aggregate the ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the corporation's directors (provided that such sale has been approved by the corporation's board of directors or a committee thereof), (c) any sale of securities of the corporation to a person or group of persons (within the meaning of the 1934 act) if, after such sale, such person or group of persons would not, in the aggregate, own, control or have the right to acquire more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the corporation, (d) any sale of securities of the corporation to a person or group of persons (within the meaning of the 1934 act) if, after such sale, such person or group of persons in the aggregate would own or control securities of the corporation (excluding any series a preferred stock being converted and disposed of in connection with such conversion event) which possess in the aggregate the ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the corporation's directors, and (e) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the corporation if, after such transaction (but without taking into account the restricted stock converted by the regulated holder) a person or group of persons (within the meaning of the 1934 act) in the aggregate would own or control securities which possess in the aggregate the ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the ex 99.2 - 4 surviving corporation's directors (provided that the transaction has been approved by the corporation's board of directors or a committee thereof). 3. "regulated stockholder" shall mean any stockholder (i) that, directly or indirectly, due to its ownership by an entity subject to regulation y of the board of governors of the federal reserve system, 12 c.f.r. part 225 (or any successor to such regulation) ("regulation y"), is itself subject to the provisions of regulation y and (ii) that holds preferred stock or common stock of the corporation. 4. "restricted stock" means, with respect to any regulated stockholder, any outstanding shares of common stock and/or series a preferred stock and/or series b preferred stock ever held of record by such regulated stockholder or its affiliates, excluding treasury shares; provided, however, that any such shares shall cease to be restricted stock when such shares are transferred in a transaction which is a conversion event or are acquired by the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation; and provided, further that the corporation shall have no responsibility for determining whether any outstanding shares of common stock and/or series a preferred stock constitute restricted stock with respect to any particular regulated stockholder, but shall instead be entitled to receive, and rely exclusively upon, a written notice provided by such regulated stockholder designating such shares as restricted stock. (b) issuance of shares of common stock or other securities on conversion. (i) pursuant to section 4(j) herein, the corporation shall issue, at its expense, and shall deliver to such holder of series a preferred stock ("holder"), (i) a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in section 4(d). (ii) such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the conversion date (as defined in section 4(j)(iii)), and at such time the rights of the holder shall cease and the holder shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of common stock issued upon conversion. (c) no adjustments for dividends. no payment or adjustment shall be made by or on behalf of the corporation on account of any dividends on the common stock issued upon such conversion which were declared for payment to holders of common stock of record as of a date prior to the conversion date. (d) cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock. in lieu of any fraction of a share of common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment for such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the fair value per share of common stock at the close of business on the conversion date. (e) adjustment of conversion price of common stock. (i) except as provided in section 4(e)(vii), in case, at any time or from time to time after the reference date, the corporation shall issue or sell any shares of any class of common stock for a consideration per share less than the fair value (as defined in section 4(e)(viii) below), then forthwith upon such issue or sale the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale shall be reduced to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect prior to the adjustment by a fraction determined by dividing (a) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale multiplied by the fair value per share of common stock immediately prior to such issue or sale, and (2) the consideration, if any, received by the corporation upon such issue or sale, by (b) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale multiplied by the fair value per share of common stock immediately prior to such issue or sale. no adjustment of the conversion price, however, shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, but any lesser adjustment ex 99.2 - 5 shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to two cents per share or more. (ii) for the purposes of subsection 4(e)(i) above, the following paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive, shall also be applicable: (1) in case at any time the corporation shall grant any rights to subscribe for, or any rights or options or warrants to purchase, common stock or any stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein called "convertible securities"), whether or not such rights or options or the right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities (determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for the granting of such rights or options or warrants, plus the maximum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such rights or options, plus, in the case of any such rights or options or warrants which relate to such convertible securities, the maximum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such convertible securities and upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options) shall be less than the fair value in effect immediately prior to the time of the granting of such rights or options or warrants, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options shall (as of the date of granting of such rights or options) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for such price per share and the current conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subsection 4(e)(i) above. except as provided in subsection 4(e)(v), no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such rights or options or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time on or after the reference date the corporation shall grant, issue or sell any options or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the holders of common stock of all classes ("purchase rights"), then each holder shall be entitled (but not obligated) to acquire, in lieu of any other adjustment provided for in this subsection 4(e) and upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which such holder could have acquired if it had held the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock immediately prior to the time or times at which the corporation granted, issued or sold such purchase rights. (2) in case at any time the corporation shall issue or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for the issue or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities) shall be less than the fair value immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of such convertible securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for such price per share and the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subsection 4(e)(i) above, provided that (x) except as provided in subsection 4(e)(v), no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of ex 99.2 - 6 such convertible securities, and (y) if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the conversion price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of subsection 4(e)(ii), no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (3) with respect to any dividend or other distribution upon any stock of the corporation payable in common stock or convertible securities, any common stock or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration and the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subsection 4(e)(i) above. (4) in case at any time any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the corporation therefor, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the corporation in connection therewith. in case any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the corporation shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the corporation in connection therewith. in case any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger of another corporation into the corporation, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of the assets of such merged corporation as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith after deducting therefrom all cash and other consideration (if any) paid by the corporation in connection with such merger. (5) in case at any time the corporation shall take a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock or in convertible securities, or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (6) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, but the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of common stock for the purposes of subsection 4(e). (iii) in the event that the corporation shall make any distribution of its assets upon or with respect to its common stock, as a liquidating or partial liquidating dividend, or other than as a dividend payable out of current earnings or any surplus legally available for dividends under the laws of the state of incorporation of the corporation, the holder shall, if the conversion date is after the record date for such distribution or, in the absence of a record date, after the date of such distribution, receive, in addition to the shares subscribed for, the amount of such assets (or, at the option of the corporation, a sum equal to the fair value thereof at the time of distribution as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith) which would have been distributed to such holder if the conversion date had occurred immediately prior to the record date for such distribution or, in the absence of a record date, immediately prior to the date of such distribution. (iv) in case at any time the corporation shall subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares or upon any issuance by the corporation of a greater number of shares of common stock in a pro rata exchange for all of its outstanding shares of common stock, the conversion ex 99.2 - 7 price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation shall be combined into a smaller number of shares or upon any issuance by the corporation of a lesser number of shares of common stock in a pro rata exchange for all of its outstanding shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. (v) if the purchase price provided for in any right or option referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection 4(e)(ii), or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2) of said subsection 4(e)(ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, shall change or a different purchase price or rate shall become effective at any time or from time to time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), then, upon such change becoming effective, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased or decreased to such conversion price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the granting or issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities been made upon the basis of (1) the issuance of the number of shares of common stock theretofore actually delivered upon the exercise of such options or rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and the total consideration received therefor, and (2) the granting or issuance at the time of such change of any such options, rights, or convertible securities then still outstanding for the consideration, if any, received by the corporation therefor and to be received on the basis of such changed price. on the expiration of any right or option referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection 4(e)(ii), or on the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible securities referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2) of said subsection 4(e)(ii), the conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted to such amount as would have obtained had the adjustment made upon the granting or issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities been made upon the basis of the issuance or sale of only the number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. if the purchase price provided for in any such right or option, or the rate at which any such convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, shall change at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of common stock upon the exercise of any such right or option or upon conversion or exchange of any such convertible security, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be decreased to such conversion price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such right or option or convertible security been made upon the basis of the issuance of (and the total consideration received for) the shares of common stock delivered as aforesaid.

(ii) optional conversion. at any time, holders of series b preferred stock may elect to convert, in whole or in part, their series b preferred stock into fully paid and non-assessable shares of (a) common stock (with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) at the conversion price by following the procedures set forth in section 4(j) hereof or (b) series a preferred stock at a one to one ratio; provided, however, that series b preferred stock constituting restricted stock may not be converted into common stock or series a preferred stock to the extent that immediately prior thereto, or as a result of such conversion, the number of shares of common stock or series a preferred stock which constitute such restricted stock held by all holders thereof would exceed the number of shares of common stock or series a preferred stock which such regulated stockholder reasonably determines it and its affiliates may own, control or have the power to vote under any law, regulation, rule or other requirement of any governmental authority at the time applicable to such regulated stockholder or its affiliates; and, provided, further, that each holder of series b preferred stock may convert such shares into common stock or series a preferred stock if such holder reasonably believes that such converted shares will be transferred within fifteen (15) days or already have been transferred pursuant to a conversion event (defined below) and such holder agrees not to vote any such shares of common stock or series a preferred stock prior to such conversion event and undertakes to promptly convert such shares back into series b preferred stock if such shares are not transferred pursuant to a conversion event. each regulated stockholder may provide for further restrictions upon the ex 99.3 - 3 conversion of any shares of restricted stock by providing the corporation with signed, written instructions specifying such additional restrictions and legending such shares as to the existence of such restrictions. (iii) conversion price. the "conversion price" shall initially be $2.00 per share. the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion is the liquidation preference divided by the then applicable conversion price, as adjusted from time to time as provided in section 4(e), multiplied by the number of shares of series b preferred stock converted. notwithstanding any provision of this section 4(a)(iii) to the contrary, each holder of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to convert shares of series b preferred stock in connection with any conversion event if such holder reasonably believes that such conversion event will be consummated, and a written request for conversion from any holder of series b preferred stock to the corporation stating such holder's reasonable belief that a conversion event shall occur shall be conclusive and shall obligate the corporation to effect such conversion in a timely manner so as to enable each such holder to participate in such conversion event. the corporation will not cancel the shares of series b preferred stock so converted before the 15th day following such conversion event and will reserve such shares until such 15th day for reissuance in compliance with the next sentence. if any shares of series b preferred stock are converted into shares of common stock or series a preferred stock in connection with a conversion event and such shares of common stock or series a preferred stock are not actually distributed, disposed of or sold pursuant to such conversion event, such shares of common stock or series a preferred stock shall be promptly converted back into the same number of shares of series b preferred stock.

(2) in case at any time the corporation shall issue or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for the issue or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the corporation upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities) shall be less than the fair value immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of such convertible securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for such price per share and the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subsection 4(e)(i) above, provided that (x) except as provided in subsection 4(e)(v), no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and (y) if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the conversion ex 99.3 - 6 price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of subsection 4(e)(ii), no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (3) with respect to any dividend or other distribution upon any stock of the corporation payable in common stock or convertible securities, any common stock or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration and the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subsection 4(e)(i) above. (4) in case at any time any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the corporation therefor, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the corporation in connection therewith. in case any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the corporation shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the corporation in connection therewith. in case any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger of another corporation into the corporation, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of the assets of such merged corporation as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith after deducting therefrom all cash and other consideration (if any) paid by the corporation in connection with such merger. (5) in case at any time the corporation shall take a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock or in convertible securities, or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (6) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, but the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of common stock for the purposes of subsection 4(e). (iii) in the event that the corporation shall make any distribution of its assets upon or with respect to its common stock, as a liquidating or partial liquidating dividend, or other than as a dividend payable out of current earnings or any surplus legally available for dividends under the laws of the state of incorporation of the corporation, the holder shall, if the conversion date is after the record date for such distribution or, in the absence of a record date, after the date of such distribution, receive, in addition to the shares subscribed for, the amount of such assets (or, at the option of the corporation, a sum equal to the fair value thereof at the time of distribution as determined by the board of directors of the corporation in good faith) which would have been distributed to such holder if the conversion date had occurred immediately prior to the record date for such distribution or, in the absence of a record date, immediately prior to the date of such distribution. (iv) in case at any time the corporation shall subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares or upon any issuance by the corporation of a greater number of shares of common stock in a pro rata exchange for all of its outstanding shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation shall be combined into a smaller number of shares or upon ex 99.3 - 7 any issuance by the corporation of a lesser number of shares of common stock in a pro rata exchange for all of its outstanding shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. (v) if the purchase price provided for in any right or option referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection 4(e)(ii), or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2) of said subsection 4(e)(ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, shall change or a different purchase price or rate shall become effective at any time or from time to time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), then, upon such change becoming effective, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased or decreased to such conversion price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the granting or issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities been made upon the basis of (1) the issuance of the number of shares of common stock theretofore actually delivered upon the exercise of such options or rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and the total consideration received therefor, and (2) the granting or issuance at the time of such change of any such options, rights, or convertible securities then still outstanding for the consideration, if any, received by the corporation therefor and to be received on the basis of such changed price. on the expiration of any right or option referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection 4(e)(ii), or on the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible securities referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2) of said subsection 4(e)(ii), the conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted to such amount as would have obtained had the adjustment made upon the granting or issuance of such rights or options or convertible securities been made upon the basis of the issuance or sale of only the number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. if the purchase price provided for in any such right or option, or the rate at which any such convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, shall change at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of common stock upon the exercise of any such right or option or upon conversion or exchange of any such convertible security, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be decreased to such conversion price as would have obtained had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such right or option or convertible security been made upon the basis of the issuance of (and the total consideration received for) the shares of common stock delivered as aforesaid. (vi) for so long as shares of series b preferred stock are issued and outstanding, the corporation may not consolidate or merge with or into another person, unless (i) the corporation is the surviving entity, or the person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the corporation) is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of the united states, any state thereof or the district of columbia; and (ii) the series b preferred stock shall be converted or exchanged for and shall become shares of such successor, transferee or resulting person having in respect of such successor, transferee or successor person the same powers, preferences, and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the series b preferred stock had immediately prior to such transaction. (vii) the following events shall not effect an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to this section 4(e): (1) the issuance of common stock by the corporation upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock or the series a preferred stock; (2) the issuance of options to acquire shares of common stock not to exceed 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock, on a fully diluted basis, as of the effective date of this certificate, from time to time issuable or issued to employees, consultants or directors of the corporation granted or to be granted with the approval of the board of directors of the corporation and the common stock issuable or issued upon exercise thereof; (3) the issuance of warrants to acquire 1,500,000 shares of common stock to be issued by the corporation in exchange for identical warrants issued by usol holdings, inc., a delaware corporation ("usol") to former creditors of u.s. online communications, inc. in connection with the sale of assets to usol and the issuance by the corporation of common stock issuable or issued upon exercise thereof; ex 99.3 - 8 (4) the issuance of 3,175,000 shares of common stock by the corporation in exchange for 3,175,000 shares of usol common stock in connection with the merger between usol and the corporation; (5) the issuance of warrants to acquire 325,000 shares of common stock to be issued by the corporation in exchange for identical warrants issued by usol to gmac commercial mortgage corporation in connection with the sale of assets to usol and the issuance by the corporation of common stock issuable or issued upon exercise thereof; and (6) the issuance of warrants to acquire 259,000 shares of common stock to be issued by the corporation in exchange for identical warrants issued by usol to amstar capital group or its affiliates, in connection with any financial advisory arrangements, and the issuance by the corporation of common stock issuable or issued upon exercise thereof. (viii) "fair value" of the common stock as of a particular date shall mean the average of the daily closing prices for the preceding twenty trading days before the day in question. the closing price for each day shall be the last reported sale price or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, in either case on the principal national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system. if no price can be determined by the foregoing method, "fair value" shall mean the fair value thereof as determined by mutual agreement reached by the corporation and the holders of a majority of the shares of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock (the "majority of the holders") or, in the event the parties are unable to agree, an opinion of an independent investment banking firm or firms in accordance with the following procedure. in the case of any event which gives rise to a requirement to determine "fair value" hereunder, the corporation shall be responsible for initiating the process by which fair value shall be determined as promptly as practicable, but in any event within twenty (20) days following such event and if the procedures contemplated herein in connection with determining fair value have not been complied with fully, then any such determination of fair value for any purpose hereunder shall be deemed to be preliminary and subject to adjustment pending full compliance with such procedures. upon the occurrence of an event requiring the determination of fair value, the corporation shall give the holders of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock notice of such event, and the corporation and the holders of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock shall engage in direct good faith discussions to arrive at a mutually agreeable determination of fair value. in the event the corporation and the majority of the holders are unable to arrive at a mutually agreeable determination within thirty (30) days of the notice, an independent investment banking firm of national standing selected by the corporation shall make such determination and render such opinion. the determination so made shall be conclusive and binding on the corporation and the holders of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock. the fees and expenses of the investment banking firm retained for such purpose shall be shared equally by the corporation and the holders of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock. (ix) if at any time or from time to time conditions arise by reason of action taken by the corporation which are not adequately covered by the provisions of subsection 4(e), and which might materially and adversely affect the exercise rights of the holders of series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock, upon the request of at least a majority of the holders, the corporation shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing (which may be the regular auditors of the corporation), which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, of the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock, on a basis consistent with the standards established in the other provisions of subsection 4(e), necessary in order to preserve without diminution the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock and series a preferred stock. upon receipt of such opinion, the board of directors shall forthwith make the adjustments, if any, described therein. ex 99.3 - 9 (f) covenant to reserve shares of common stock and series a preferred stock for conversion.

(j) mechanics of conversion. (i) optional conversion. in order to convert series b preferred stock into full shares of common stock or series a preferred stock, a holder shall deliver, no later than 11:00 a.m., pacific standard time on the business day next preceding the conversion date, to the office of the corporation's designated transfer agent for the series b preferred stock (the "transfer agent") (1) a fully executed notice of conversion ("notice of conversion"), and (2) the original certificate or certificates evidencing the series b preferred stock being converted (a "certificate"), duly endorsed.

5 usol holdings, inc. preferred stock registration rights agreement materially and adversely affect the price or success of the offering (a "material adverse effect"). in the event the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the company or the shareholders and the other shareholders that the amount of shareholder common stock and other common stock proposed to be included in such demand registration by shareholders and other shareholders is sufficiently large to cause a material adverse effect, the shareholder common stock and other common stock to be included in such registration shall equal the number of shares which the company is so advised can be sold in such offering without a material adverse effect and such shares shall be allocated pro rata among the shareholders and the other shareholders on the basis of the number of shares of shareholder common stock and other common stock requested to be included in such registration. 3.2 right to include securities. if at any time all of the shares of shareholder common stock are not then registered under the securities act, and the company proposes to register any shares of its common stock under the securities act (other than pursuant to an excluded registration), whether or not for sale for its own account, it will each such time as soon as practicable give written notice of its intention to do so to the shareholders. in such event, upon the written request (which request shall specify the total number of shares of shareholder common stock intended to be disposed of by the requesting shareholder) of any shareholder made within 15 days after the receipt of any such notice (10 days if the company gives telephonic notice with written confirmation to follow promptly thereafter), stating that (i) such registration will be on form s-3 and (ii) such shorter period of time is required because of a planned filing date, the company will use all reasonable efforts to effect the registration under the securities act in the manner initially proposed by the company of all shareholder common stock held by the shareholders which the company has been so requested to register for sale. if the company thereafter determines for any reason in its sole discretion not to register or to delay registration of the common stock, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the shareholder and (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of the obligation to register any shareholder common stock in connection with such registration and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any shareholder common stock of the shareholder for the same period as the delay in registration of such other securities. the exercise by a shareholder of any right under this section 3.2 will not relieve the company of its obligations to such shareholder under section 3.1. 3.3 priority in incidental registration. in a registration pursuant to section 3.2 hereof, if the managing underwriter of any such underwritten offering to which section 3.2 pertains shall inform the company by letter of its belief that the number of shares of shareholder common stock and other common stock to be included in such registration would have a material adverse effect, then the company will be required to include in such registration only that number of shares of shareholder common stock and other common stock which it is so advised can be included in such offering without causing such material adverse effect. with respect to a registration that is the subject of section 3.2 hereof, shares of common stock proposed by the company to be registered for issuance by the company or for sale by any person exercising "demand" registration rights shall have the first priority and all shares of shareholder common stock owned by the shareholders exercising incidental registration rights and all shares of other common stock owned by the other shareholders ex 99.5 - 6 usol holdings, inc. preferred stock registration rights agreement exercising incidental rights shall be given second priority without preference among the relevant shareholders and other shareholders. if less than all of the shares of shareholder common stock and other common stock duly requested to be included in such registration are to be registered therein, such shares of shareholder common stock and other common stock shall be included in the registration pro rata based on the total number of such shares sought to be registered other than for issuance by the company or sale by third parties exercising "demand" registration rights in accordance with the preceding sentence. if, as a result of the provisions of this section 3.3, any shareholder or other shareholder shall not be entitled to include all of such shareholder's shares of shareholder common stock or other common stock in such registration, such shareholder may withdraw such shareholder's request to include shareholder common stock or other common stock, as applicable, in such registration. 3.4 registration procedures. in connection with the company's obligations to register the shareholder common stock pursuant to this article iii, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect such registration in accordance herewith and the company will promptly: (a) prepare and file with the sec as expeditiously as possible, but in any case within 60 days after the selection of an investment banking firm pursuant to section 3.1.3 the requisite registration statement to effect such registration and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and to remain continuously effective until the earlier to occur of (x) 180 days following the date on which such registration statement is declared effective (the "effective date") or (y) the termination of the offering being made as set forth thereunder; (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective as set forth above and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all shares of shareholder common stock covered by such registration statement until such shareholder common stock has been sold; (c) furnish to the managing underwriter, if any, and to the shareholders, at least one executed original of the registration statement and to each of the selling securityholders such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under rule 424 under the securities act, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, as may reasonably be requested by such selling securityholder (it being understood that the company consents to the use of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each seller of shareholder common stock and the underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the shareholder common stock covered by the registration of which such prospectus, amendment or supplement is a part).

(f) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification of any of the registered securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest possible moment;
