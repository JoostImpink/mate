&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (iv)&#160; in the event that the company allows cash dividends to be converted into, or to purchase shares of the company's capital stock pursuant to the company's automatic dividend reinvestment plan or similar program (the "drip"), the record owner of each voting trust certificate may notify the voting trustees of the portion of the cash dividends attributable to the shares represented by his or her voting trust certificate to be reinvested in shares of the company (the "drip shares"). upon receipt of such notice, the voting trustees shall notify the company's transfer agent of the number of shares that should be subject to the drip. upon receipt of any drip shares, the voting trustees shall notify the company's transfer agent that the drip shares should be titled directly in the name of the shareholder who elected to participate in the drip. any drip shares received by a shareholder shall not be subject to the terms of this voting trust. 5 &#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (b)&#160; death or disability of a voting trustee . the rights and duties of a voting trustee shall terminate on his or her death or disability and no interest in any of the property owned or held hereunder nor any of the rights or duties of the voting trustee may be transferred by will, devise, succession, or in any manner, except as provided in this voting trust. the heirs, administrators, and executors of a voting trustee shall, however, have the right and absolute duty to convey any property held by the voting trustee to the successor voting trustee, if any, or to the shareholders promptly upon termination of this voting trust. for purposes of this voting trust, disability shall mean the inability of a voting trustee to perform satisfactorily his or her duties hereunder for a period of 120 days in the aggregate out of 150 consecutive days as a result of a physical or mental illness or other disability, which, in the written opinion of a physician of recognized ability and reputation, makes it highly likely that such illness or disability will continue for a significant period of time. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (c)&#160; successor voting trustee . &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (i)&#160; subject to the approval of the other voting trustees as provided herein, each voting trustee shall have the right to name one or more potential successors to serve as voting trustee if, for any reason, such voting trustee ceases be a voting trustee under this voting trust; provided however, that any successor appointed by a voting trustee must meet the following requirements (an "eligible successor"): [a] an individual at least 21 years of age, and [b] a permitted transferee under the stockholders agreement. if a voting trustee names more than one potential successor, he or she shall also indicate the order in which such potential successors shall be eligible to serve as successor voting trustee. at the time this voting trust is executed, each of the voting trustees shall submit to one another a list of their initial potential successors, in the order in which such initial potential successors shall be eligible to serve as voting trustee. the other voting trustees shall have a 60 day period after the list of initial potential successors is provided in which to provide written notice of objection to one or more of the initial potential successors. if the remaining voting trustees fail to provide written notice of objection to the initial potential successors, such initial potential successors (the&#160;"approved successors") shall be deemed approved by the voting trustees and no other opportunity for objection shall be provided at the time such successor is appointed pursuant to section 6(b)(iii) below. an objection notice is only effective if both remaining voting trustees provide such written notice. 6 &#160;

however, such additional potential successors shall be subject to the approval of the other voting trustees. upon receiving notice that a voting trustee has proposed to name additional potential successors, the two remaining voting trustees shall have 60 days to provide written notice of objection to the appointment of such additional potential successors. if the remaining voting trustees fail to provide written notice of objection within such 60 day period, then the appointment of the additional potential successor voting trustee shall be deemed approved and such additional potential successor shall become an approved successor. an objection notice is only effective if both remaining voting trustees provide such written notice. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (iii)&#160; upon the death, disability or resignation of a voting trustee, the remaining voting trustees shall provide notice to the first potential approved successor of the opportunity to accept appointment as a successor voting trustee and shall include with such notice a copy of this voting trust. such approved successor shall have 10 days from receipt of such notice to accept designation as a successor voting trustee by executing and delivering to the remaining voting trustees a counterpart signature page to this voting trust in the form attached hereto as exhibit c ("counterpart signature page"). if such counterpart signature page is not executed and delivered to the remaining voting trustees within such 10 day time period, such approved successor shall not serve as a voting trustee. at the end of such 10 day period, the remaining voting trustees shall provide notice to the next approved successor and provide such approved successor a 10 day opportunity to accept designation as a successor voting trustee by executing and delivering to the remaining voting trustees a counterpart signature page. such process shall be repeated until an approved successor executes a counterpart signature page or there are no more approved successors, in which case a successor voting trustee may be chosen by the procedure described in section 6(b)(v) below. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (iv)&#160; in the event that a voting trustee names his or her spouse as a potential successor and at any time a petition for divorce is filed by either the potential successor spouse or the former voting trustee, then such potential successor spouse shall be immediately disqualified from serving as a voting trustee and shall no longer be an approved successor. at any time a petition for divorce is filed while the successor spouse is serving as a voting trustee, the successor spouse shall be immediately removed from the position of voting trustee and the next approved successor who executes a counterpart signature page shall become the successor voting trustee. if no other approved successor is named, a successor voting trustee may be chosen by the procedure described in section 6(b)(v) below. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (v)&#160; if, for any reason, a voting trustee ceases to be a voting trustee under this voting trust and such voting trustee has failed to name his or her own potential successor voting trustee or his or her approved successors do not accept designation as a voting trustee, a successor v oting trustee shall be designated by majority vote of the shares held by the holders of the voting trust certificates. if they fail to so designate a successor voting trustee within 60 days following notice of death, disability or resignation of the voting trustee, one or more holders of the voting trust certificates or the resigning voting trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction in the county of milwaukee, state of wisconsin for appointment of a successor voting trustee. any potential successor voting trustee designated pursuant to this section must meet the requirements of an eligible successor, as defined in section 6(b)(i) above. 7 &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (vi)&#160; upon acceptance of designation as a successor voting trustee and execution of a counterpart signature page, the successor voting trustee shall have all of the rights and duties of the predecessor voting trustee hereunder, including but not limited to the right to appoint his or her successors; provided, however, that in the event that a successor spouse is removed as provided in section 6(b)(v) above, the next approved successor named by the voting trustee who appointed such successor spouse shall be appointed voting trustee. 7.&#160;
