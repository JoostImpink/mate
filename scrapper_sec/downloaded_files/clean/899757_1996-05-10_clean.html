and whereas, the fund wishes to engage the investment advisor to provide investment advisory services with respect to the fund's assets; and whereas, the investment advisor wishes to accept the same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth; now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual premises and covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 1. investment management services. in accordance with the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of the fund, and under the ultimate supervision of the board of directors of the fund (the "directors") from time to time as provided therein, and in accordance with the investment objectives, polices, guidelines and restrictions which are set forth in the memorandum or which are otherwise communicated to the investment advisor in writing by the fund, the investment advisor shall use its reasonable efforts to invest the assets of the fund according to the strategy set forth in the memorandum. capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall be used herein as defined in the memorandum. 2. authority of the investment advisor. the investment advisor shall have full discretion and authority, without obtaining the fund's prior approval, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the fund in such manner as the investment advisor considers appropriate consistent with the memorandum. in furtherance of the foregoing, the fund hereby designates and appoints the investment advisor as its agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority and without the need for further approval of 364609.1 the fund (except as may be required by law), to carry out the following with respect to the assets of the fund: (a) to effect purchases and sales (including short sales) or (i) securities of any type whatsoever, denominated in any currency, whether or not issued by government entities, partnerships, trusts or corporations, (ii) any put or call options thereon (including the writing of options, whether covered or uncovered), and (iii) other securities and instruments consistent with the fund's investment policies and program; (b) to make all decisions relating to the manner, method and timing of investment transactions, and to select brokers and dealers for the execution, clearance and settlement of any transactions; (c) to borrow from banks, brokers or other financial institutions to the extent permitted by the memorandum and to pledge assets of the fund in connection therewith; (d) to direct custodians to deliver funds or securities for the purpose of effecting transactions, and to instruct custodians to exercise or abstain from exercising any privilege or right attaching to such assets; and (e) to make and execute, in the name and on behalf of the fund, all such documents (including, without limitation, customer agreements and other documents in connection with the establishment and maintenance of brokerage accounts) and to take all such other actions as the investment advisor considers necessary or advisable to carry out its investment management duties hereunder. 3. brokerage. in the course of selecting brokers, dealers, banks and intermediaries to effect transactions for the fund, the investment advisor may agree to such commissions, fees and other charges on behalf of the fund as the investment advisor shall deem reasonable in the circumstances taking into account all such factors as it deems relevant, including the quality of research and other services made available to it (even if such services are not for the exclusive benefit of the fund). it is understood that the costs of such services will not necessarily represent the lowest costs available and that the investment advisor is under no obligation to combine or arrange orders so as to obtain reduced charges. 4. investments for the accounts of others and allocation of opportunities. (a) it is understood that the investment advisor and its directors, officers, employees and principals may from time to time purchase and sell securities or other investment assets for their own accounts, for the accounts of their families, for the account of any entity in which they have a beneficial interest or for the accounts of others for whom they may provide investment advisory or other services (collectively, "managed accounts"), notwithstanding the fact that the fund may have or may take an investment position in the 364609.1 2 same security; provided, however, that the investment advisor shall not cause the fund to purchase any asset from or sell any asset to the investment advisor, or any of its directors, officers, employees or principals or any account or entity controlled by such persons without the consent of the fund. (b) it is understood that when the investment advisor determines that it would be appropriate for the fund and one or more managed accounts to participate in an investment opportunity, the investment advisor will seek to execute orders for the fund and for such managed accounts on an equitable basis. in such situations, the investment advisor may place orders for the fund and each managed account simultaneously, and if all such orders are not filled at the same price, the investment advisor may cause the fund and each managed account to pay or receive the average of the prices at which the orders were filled for the fund and all managed accounts. if all such orders cannot be fully executed under prevailing market conditions, the investment advisor may allocate the securities traded among the fund and the managed accounts in a manner which it considers equitable, taking into account the size of the order placed for the fund and each such managed account as well as any other factors which it deems relevant. (c) the investment advisor will not organize any other investment fund with the same objectives as the fund (other than a parallel u.s. limited partnership for u.s. investors) unless at least sixty percent (60%) of the capital of the fund has been invested in portfolio securities consistent with the fund's objectives. 5. compensation.

(b) in addition to the management fee, once the fund has made aggregate distributions to holders of its common shares equal to their initial investment plus a 7% non-compounded annual return (the "preferred return"), then the investment advisor will receive distributions in its capacity as holder of the fund's founders shares until it has received cumulative distributions equal to a 1.75% non-compounded annual return on the fund's capital,and thereafter distributions will be made 80% to holders of common shares of the fund and 20% to the investment advisor in its capacity as holder of founders shares, in each case as provided in the memorandum and in the articles and memorandum of association of the fund. 6. scope of liabilities. the investment advisor shall not be liable to the fund, its affiliates or shareholders for any losses, damages, expenses or claims occasioned by any 364609.1 3 act or omission of the investment advisor in connection with the performance of its services hereunder, other than as a result of its own willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties hereunder, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 7. indemnification. the fund shall indemnify the investment advisor (which shall include solely for purposes of this section 9 any of its directors, officers, employees and shareholders) against and hold them harmless from any expense, loss, liability or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened to be asserted by any third party, in connection with the investment advisor's serving or having served as such pursuant to this agreement; provided, however, that the investment advisor shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to any expense, loss, liability or damage which was caused by its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of its duties hereunder. the fund shall advance to the investment advisor the reasonable costs and expenses of investigating and/or defending any such claim, subject to receiving a written undertaking from the investment advisor to repay any such amounts advanced to it in the event and to the extent of any subsequent determination that the investment advisor was not entitled to indemnification hereunder. in the event that the investment advisor is or becomes a party to any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the investment advisor shall promptly notify the fund thereof. following such notice, the fund shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the investment advisor. after notice from the fund to the investment advisor of an election so to assume the defense thereof, the fund will not be liable to the investment advisor hereunder for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the investment advisor in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation unless counsel for the investment advisor shall reasonably determine that there is a conflict of interest which requires separate representation of the parties. the fund shall not be liable hereunder for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the fund enter into any settlement which shall impose any obligation on the investment advisor without its written consent. 8. independent contractor. for all purposes of this agreement, the investment advisor shall be an independent contractor and not an employee or agent of the fund, nor shall anything herein be construed as making the fund a partner or co-venturer with the investment advisor or any of its affiliates. except as provided in this agreement, the investment advisor shall not have authority to bind, obligate or represent the fund. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the investment advisor shall have no authority whatsoever (nor shall it have any duty) on behalf of the fund to: (i) communicate with shareholders of the fund or with the general public;

(a) the initial term of this agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue until the final dissolution and liquidation of the fund, subject to termination by either party upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other in the event of any material breach by the other party of its obligations under this agreement, which breach is not remedied within such period. (b) in the event of the termination of this agreement, (i) the investment advisor shall be entitled to the management fee accrued through the date of termination, (ii) the provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall survive any termination, and (iii) the investment advisor shall have the right, at its option, to resell the founders shares to the fund at a purchase price equal to the accrued but unpaid distributions due to the holders of founders shares through the date of such termination based upon the net value of the fund (as defined in the memorandum) as of such date. 12. modification; waiver. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this agreement shall not be amended nor shall any provision of this agreement be considered modified or waived unless evidenced by a writing signed by the parties to be charged with such amendment, waiver or modification. 13. entire agreement; binding effect; assignment. this agreement represents the entire agreement among the parties, shall be

the holder thereof, except to the extent of any limitations imposed under policy 312.03(c) of the new york stock exchange, in whole or in part, into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock equal to the ratio of: (1) the principal amount of this note or the portion thereof to be converted to (2) the conversion price in effect on the conversion date, 353737.1 10 or into such additional or other securities, cash or property and at such other rates as required in accordance with the provisions of this section 5, at any time and from time to time. ii. for purposes of this note, the "conversion price" shall initially be the lesser of: (1) $9.00 per share and (2) the average of the daily closing prices (last close price, regular way) of the common stock on the new york stock exchange for the 30-day period ending may 1, 1996, as such conversion price may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this section 5. iii. not later than may 15, 1996, the borrower shall provide written notice to the holder of this note at the address indicated herein setting forth the conversion price as of the date of such notice. iv. the borrower will give

give the lender written notice of any change in control event described in section 1(j)(iii) hereof promptly after the borrower becomes aware of such event. v. if, at the time of receipt by the borrower from the lender of a conversion notice, the borrower is precluded by policy 312.03(c) of the new york stock exchange or any other law, rule or regulation to which borrower is subject from converting this note in whole or in part into shares of common stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 5, then the portion of the principal amount of this note not so precluded from being converted shall be converted as provided in this section 5 and the maturity date of the balance of the principal amount of this note shall be extended to march 31, 1997 and the borrower will continue to pay interest thereon as provided in section 2 hereof. vi. if the maturity date of a portion of this note is extended as provided in section 5(a)(v) hereof, on march 31, 1997 the borrower will pay to the lender, in full satisfaction of this note, an amount in cash (or other consideration acceptable to the lender c/m: 11901.0003 353737.1 11 in the lender's sole discretion having a value) equal to the sum of: (1) the principal amount of this note then outstanding, (2) the product of: (a) the ratio of (i) the principal amount of this note then outstanding on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof to (ii) the conversion price in effect on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof, and (b) the difference between: (i) the conversion right triggering event per share consideration and (ii) the conversion price in effect on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof; and (3) interest on this note, at an annual rate equal to the ratio of (i) four times the most recent quarterly dividend per share paid or payable on the common stock to (ii) the conversion price in effect on

interest on any overdue amounts payable under section 5(a)(vi) hereof shall accrue at the default rate of 15% per annum and shall be payable to the extent accrued on the first date of each month. viii. if the maturity date of a portion of this note is extended as provided in section 5(a)(v) hereof, nothing in this note shall preclude the lender from converting this note or any portion 353737.1 12 thereof outstanding at any time on or prior to the date the principal amount of this note is paid in full. b. conversion procedures. i. in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of this note shall surrender this note to the borrower and shall give written notice to the borrower ("conversion notice") that the holder of this note elects to convert this note, or the portion thereof specified in said notice, into shares of common stock. the conversion notice shall also state the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock which shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be issued. this note shall, upon surrender for conversion, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of this note, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the borrower duly executed by, the holder of this note or its duly authorized attorney. ii. within ten business days after receipt of a conversion notice and surrender of this note, the borrower shall issue and deliver to the holder of this note (or upon the written order of the holder of this note) a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of this note or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section 5, and cash in respect of any fractional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion, as provided in section 5(c) hereof. if less than the total outstanding principal amount of this note is to be converted, the borrower shall issue, execute and deliver or cause to be issued, executed and delivered to (or upon the written order of) the holder of this note, without charge to the holder of this note, a new note, in the form hereof, for a principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of this note. iii. each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date (the "conversion date") on which this note shall have been surrendered to the borrower and a conversion notice with respect to such note shall have been received by the borrower, as described above. any person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the conversion date; 353737.1 13 provided, however, that surrender of this note on any date when the stock transfer books of the corporation shall be closed shall constitute the person in whose name the certificates are to be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect on the date on which such certificate or certificates shall have been surrendered. iv. except as otherwise provided in this section 5, no payment or adjustment will be made for dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the conversion date with respect to any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note as provided herein. c. cash payments in lieu of fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of this note. if any fractional shares of common stock would, but for this section 5(c), be issuable upon the conversion of this note, the borrower shall promptly after the conversion date make a payment therefor in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share of common stock on the first business day immediately preceding the conversion date. d. adjustment of conversion price. the conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time by the borrower as follows: i. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996: (1) declare a dividend or distribution on the common stock payable in shares of common stock not otherwise payable to a holder of this note as interest pursuant to section 2 hereof, (2) subdivide or reclassify outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, (3) combine shares of outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, (4) declare a dividend or distribution on the common stock in shares of any series of its capital stock other than common stock, or 353737.1 14 (5) issue by reclassification of any shares of its outstanding common stock, shares of any series of its capital stock or any obligation of the corporation or other property, then the conversion privilege and the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of this note shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other capital stock and/or property of the borrower which the holder of this note would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had this note been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the applicable record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event referred to above shall occur. ii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) for an effective purchase price per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance, then the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the ratio of: (1) the sum of: (a) the product of: (i) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the aggregate consideration receivable by the borrower in connection with such issuance to c/m: 11901.0003 353737.1 15 (2) the sum of: (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the number of additional shares of common stock to be so issued (including the number of shares underlying such rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities). if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) in an excluded transaction the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance shall not be adjusted as the result of such excluded transaction. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any shares, rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights are issued at an effective purchase price per share that is less than the conversion price in effect on the date of such issuance. to the extent that any such rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights expire without having been converted or exercised, the conversion price then in effect shall be readjusted to the conversion price which then would be in effect if such rights, options, warrants, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights had not been issued, but such readjustment shall not affect the number of shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock delivered upon any conversion prior to the date such readjustment is made. iii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 distribute to all holders of its common stock any of its assets or debt securities, or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exercisable securities of the borrower (including securities issued for cash, but excluding distributions of capital stock referred to in section 5(d)(i) hereof), then in each such case, the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such distribution less an amount equal to the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the board of 353737.1 16 directors, in good faith and as described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the portion of the assets or debt securities of the borrower so distributed or of such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities applicable to one share of common stock. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shares entitled to receive such distribution. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the distribution to holders of common stock of such rights, options, warrants, convertible securities, assets or debt securities if the plan or arrangement under which such rights, options, warrants, convertible securities, assets or debt securities are issued provides for their issuance to the holder of this note in the same pro rata amounts upon conversion thereof. iv. in any case in which this section 5(d) provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the borrower may defer until the occurrence of such event: (1) issuing to the holder of any shares of series a preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the common stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment, and (2) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional share of common stock pursuant to section 5(c). v. for purposes of any computations of aggregate consideration receivable or other consideration pursuant to this section 5, the following shall apply: (1) in the case of the issuance of shares of capital stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the borrower for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; and 353737.1 17 (2) in the case of the issuance of shares of capital stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof), and described in a resolution of the board of directors or such committee. vi. if after an adjustment the holder of this note may, upon conversion of such note, receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the borrower, the borrower shall determine on a fair basis the allocation of the adjusted conversion price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the conversion privilege and the conversion price of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this section 5. vii. in no event shall an adjustment pursuant to this section 5 reduce the conversion price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note. viii. no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the conversion price then in effect. e. effect of reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. if this note is outstanding and there shall occur: i. any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), ii. any consolidation or merger of the borrower with or into another person shall be effected as a result of which holders of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such common stock, or iii. any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the borrower as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other person, 353737.1 18 this note shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance. in any such case, appropriate adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 5. if this section 5(e) applies with respect to a transaction, section 5(d) hereof shall not apply with respect to that transaction. the above provisions of this section 5(e) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers and sales. f. taxes on shares issued. the issuance of stock certificates upon conversion of this note shall be made without charge to the converting the holder of this note for any tax in respect of the issuance thereof. g. reservation of shares; shares to be fully paid; compliance with governmental requirements. the borrower shall reserve, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares, or out of shares held in its treasury, sufficient shares of common stock to provide for the conversion of this note from time to time outstanding. the borrower covenants that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of this note will upon issuance be fully paid and nonassessable by the borrower and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof. h. notice to holders prior to certain actions. i. if: (1) the borrower shall take any action that would require an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to section 5(d) hereof; or (2) any event described in section 5(e) hereof shall occur; or (3) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the borrower shall occur; the borrower shall cause notice of such proposed action or event to be mailed to the holder of this note, as promptly as possible 353737.1 19 but in any event no later than the later of (x) the date 15 days prior to the record date for such proposed action or the effective date of such event or (y) the date on which the borrower first publicly announces such proposed action or event. ii. in any event, such notice shall specify: (1) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such action, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record of common stock are to be determined, or (2) the date on which such proposed event is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such event. 6. note events of default. upon the occurrence of a note event of default, the unpaid principal amount of this note, together with all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, shall become, or may be declared to be, immediately due and payable, upon the conditions and with the effect provided in section 12 of the note purchase agreement. 7. limitation on interest. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event shall the amount or rate of interest (including to the extent applicable any default rate interest or late payment charge) payable, contracted for, charged or received under or in connection with this note, from time to time or for whatever reason, exceed the maximum rate or amount, if any, specified by applicable law. if from any circumstance whatsoever fulfillment of any provision hereof or other documents at the time performance of such provision shall be due shall involve transcending the limit of such validity, and if from any such circumstance the lender shall ever receive an amount deemed interest by applicable law which shall exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing hereunder or on account of any other principal indebtedness of the undersigned to the lender, and not to payment of interest or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness, the excess shall be refunded to the borrower. all sums paid or agreed to be paid by the borrower for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the borrower to the lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full 353737.1 20 term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform through the term hereof. the terms and provisions of this section 7 shall control and supersede every other provision of all agreements between the borrower and the lender and all obligations of the borrower to the lender. 8. enforceability. the borrower acknowledges that this note and the borrower's obligations under this note are and shall at all times continue to be absolute and unconditional in all respects, and shall at all times be a valid, legally binding obligation of the

of equity. this note and the note purchase agreement set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the lender and the borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the borrower absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all right to assert any setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever with respect to this note or the obligations of the borrower hereunder in any action or proceeding brought by the lender to collect amounts owing under this note, or any portion thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of the borrower's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim maintained in a court of the united states, or of the state of new york if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of the borrower's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against the lender in any separate action or proceeding. the borrower acknowledges that no oral or other agreements, conditions, promises, understandings, representations or warranties exist with respect to this note or with respect to the obligations of the borrower under this note, except those specifically set forth in this note. 9. waivers and special agreements. the

time, by the lender of any obligation or of any rights or remedies (or to insist upon strict performance) in any one or more instances shall not constitute a waiver thereof (or preclude full exercise or insistence upon strict performance thereof) in that or any other instance, and any single exercise of any such right or remedies in any one or more instances shall not preclude full exercise in any other instance. 10. calculations of amounts due. all calculations of amounts due on any date, whether by acceleration or otherwise, will be made by the lender (or its agent or representative) and the borrower agrees that all such calculations will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. 11. amendments. this note may not be modified, amended, changed or terminated orally, but only by an

reclassification of any shares of its outstanding common stock, shares of any series of its capital stock or any obligation of the corporation or other property, then the conversion privilege and the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of this note shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other capital stock and/or property of the borrower which the holder of this note would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had this note been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the applicable record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become

occur. ii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) for an effective purchase price per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance, then the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the ratio of: (1) the sum of: (a) the product of: (i) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the aggregate consideration receivable by the borrower in connection with such issuance to -15- 360268.1 (2) the sum of: (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the number of additional shares of common stock to be so issued (including the number of shares underlying such rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities). if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) in an excluded transaction the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance shall not be adjusted as the result of such excluded transaction. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any shares, rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights are issued at an effective purchase price per share that is less than the conversion price in effect on the date of such issuance. to the extent that any such rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights expire without having been converted or exercised, the conversion price then in effect shall be readjusted to the conversion price which then would be in effect if such rights, options, warrants, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights had not been issued, but such readjustment shall not affect the number of shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock delivered upon any conversion prior to the date such readjustment is made. iii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 distribute to all holders of its common stock any of its assets or debt securities, or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exercisable securities of the borrower (including securities issued for cash, but excluding distributions of capital stock referred to in section 5(d)(i) hereof), then in each such case, the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such distribution less an amount

in the exchange closing notice, and (2) a certificate of the president or any vice president of the borrower, dated the exchange closing date, certifying that the conditions set forth in section 4(f) hereof have been complied with, against delivery to the borrower by the lender of this note marked cancelled and paid in full. e. this note shall be deemed to have been exchanged for shares of series a preferred stock and to have been paid in full and cancelled as of the date of delivery of the items specified in sections 4(d)(i) and (ii) hereof, which date is herein referred to as the "exchange closing date." f. the mandatory exchange of this note for shares of series a preferred stock in accordance with this section 4 shall be subject to satisfaction 353737.1 9 (or waiver in the sole discretion of the lender) of each of the following conditions on or prior to the exchange closing date: i. there shall have not occurred and be continuing an event of default or an event which, with the lapse of time or notice or both, would constitute an event of default; and ii. borrower senior management incumbent with the borrower on march 1, 1996 shall be incumbent with the borrower on the exchange closing date with substantially the same duties and responsibilities as on march 1, 1996. g. if: i. the borrower delivers an effective date notice complying in all regards with the requirements of sections 4(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) hereof and such effective date notice is not accompanied by a certificate described in section 4(b)(iii)(2) hereof, and ii. the lender fails timely to deliver either an exchange closing notice or an exchange decline notice, then the borrower may deliver to the lender, as specified in section 16(c) hereof, the items specified in section 4(d)(ii) hereof and, upon such delivery, this note shall be deemed to have exchanged for shares of series a preferred stock and to have been paid in full and cancelled as of the date of delivery by the borrower to the lender of such items. 5. conversion. a. right of conversion. i. from and after the occurrence of a conversion right triggering event, this note shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, except to the extent of any limitations imposed under policy 312.03(c) of the new york stock exchange, in whole or in part, into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock equal to the ratio of: (1) the principal amount of this note or the portion thereof to be converted to (2) the conversion price in effect on the conversion date, 353737.1 10 or into such additional or other securities, cash or property and at such other rates as required in accordance with the provisions of this section 5, at any time and from time to time. ii. for purposes of this note, the "conversion price" shall initially be the lesser of: (1) $9.00 per share and (2) the average of the daily closing prices (last close price, regular way) of the common stock on the new york stock exchange for the 30-day period ending may 1, 1996, as such conversion price may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this section 5. iii. not later than may 15, 1996, the borrower shall provide written notice to the holder of this note at the address indicated herein setting forth the conversion price as of the date of such notice. iv. the borrower will give the lender written notice of any change in control event (other than an event described in section 1(j)(iii) hereof) no later than 10 business days in advance of such change in control event and will give the lender written notice of any change in control event described in section 1(j)(iii) hereof promptly after the borrower becomes aware of such event. v. if, at the time of receipt by the borrower from the lender of a conversion notice, the borrower is precluded by policy 312.03(c) of the new york stock exchange or any other law, rule or regulation to which borrower is subject from converting this note in whole or in part into shares of common stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 5, then the portion of the principal amount of this note not so precluded from being converted shall be converted as provided in this section 5 and the maturity date of the balance of the principal amount of this note shall be extended to march 31, 1997 and the borrower will continue to pay interest thereon as provided in section 2 hereof. vi. if the maturity date of a portion of this note is extended as provided in section 5(a)(v) hereof, on march 31, 1997 the borrower will pay to the lender, in full satisfaction of this note, an amount in cash (or other consideration acceptable to the lender c/m: 11901.0003 353737.1 11 in the lender's sole discretion having a value) equal to the sum of: (1) the principal amount of this note then outstanding, (2) the product of: (a) the ratio of (i) the principal amount of this note then outstanding on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof to (ii) the conversion price in effect on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof, and (b) the difference between: (i) the conversion right triggering event per share consideration and (ii) the conversion price in effect on the date of the conversion notice referred to in section 5(a)(v) hereof; and (3) interest on this note, at an annual rate equal to the ratio of (i) four times the most recent quarterly dividend per share paid or payable on the common stock to (ii) the conversion price in effect on march 31, 1997, for the period beginning on the record date for the triggering dividend relating to the most recent dividend paid or payable on the common stock and ending on march 31, 1997. vii. interest on any overdue amounts payable under section 5(a)(vi) hereof shall accrue at the default rate of 15% per annum and shall be payable to the extent accrued on the first date of each month. viii. if the maturity date of a portion of this note is extended as provided in section 5(a)(v) hereof, nothing in this note shall preclude the lender from converting this note or any portion 353737.1 12 thereof outstanding at any time on or prior to the date the principal amount of this note is paid in full. b. conversion procedures. i. in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of this note shall surrender this note to the borrower and shall give written notice to the borrower ("conversion notice") that the holder of this note elects to convert this note, or the portion thereof specified in said notice, into shares of common stock. the conversion notice shall also state the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock which shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be issued. this note shall, upon surrender for conversion, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of this note, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the borrower duly executed by, the holder of this note or its duly authorized attorney. ii. within ten business days after receipt of a conversion notice and surrender of this note, the borrower shall issue and deliver to the holder of this note (or upon the written order of the holder of this note) a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of this note or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section 5, and cash in respect of any fractional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion, as provided in section 5(c) hereof. if less than the total outstanding principal amount of this note is to be converted, the borrower shall issue, execute and deliver or cause to be issued, executed and delivered to (or upon the written order of) the holder of this note, without charge to the holder of this note, a new note, in the form hereof, for a principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of this note. iii. each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date (the "conversion date") on which this note shall have been surrendered to the borrower and a conversion notice with respect to such note shall have been received by the borrower, as described above. any person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the conversion date; 353737.1 13 provided, however, that surrender of this note on any date when the stock transfer books of the corporation shall be closed shall constitute the person in whose name the certificates are to be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect on the date on which such certificate or certificates shall have been surrendered. iv. except as otherwise provided in this section 5, no payment or adjustment will be made for dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the conversion date with respect to any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note as provided herein. c. cash payments in lieu of fractional shares. no fractional shares of common stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of this note. if any fractional shares of common stock would, but for this section 5(c), be issuable upon the conversion of this note, the borrower shall promptly after the conversion date make a payment therefor in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share of common stock on the first business day immediately preceding the conversion date. d. adjustment of conversion price. the conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time by the borrower as follows: i. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996: (1) declare a dividend or distribution on the common stock payable in shares of common stock not otherwise payable to a holder of this note as interest pursuant to section 2 hereof, (2) subdivide or reclassify outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, (3) combine shares of outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, (4) declare a dividend or distribution on the common stock in shares of any series of its capital stock other than common stock, or 353737.1 14 (5) issue by reclassification of any shares of its outstanding common stock, shares of any series of its capital stock or any obligation of the corporation or other property, then the conversion privilege and the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of this note shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other capital stock and/or property of the borrower which the holder of this note would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had this note been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the applicable record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any event referred to above shall occur. ii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) for an effective purchase price per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance, then the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the ratio of: (1) the sum of: (a) the product of: (i) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the aggregate consideration receivable by the borrower in connection with such issuance to c/m: 11901.0003 353737.1 15 (2) the sum of: (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the number of additional shares of common stock to be so issued (including the number of shares underlying such rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities). if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 issue any shares of common stock (or any rights, warrants, options or convertible or exercisable securities entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase any shares of common stock or any stock appreciation rights entitling the holders thereof to any interest in an increase in value, however measured, of shares of common stock) in an excluded transaction the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issuance shall not be adjusted as the result of such excluded transaction. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any shares, rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights are issued at an effective purchase price per share that is less than the conversion price in effect on the date of such issuance. to the extent that any such rights, warrants, options, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights expire without having been converted or exercised, the conversion price then in effect shall be readjusted to the conversion price which then would be in effect if such rights, options, warrants, convertible or exercisable securities or stock appreciation rights had not been issued, but such readjustment shall not affect the number of shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock delivered upon any conversion prior to the date such readjustment is made. iii. if the borrower shall at any time after march 1, 1996 distribute to all holders of its common stock any of its assets or debt securities, or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exercisable securities of the borrower (including securities issued for cash, but excluding distributions of capital stock referred to in section 5(d)(i) hereof), then in each such case, the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such distribution less an amount equal to the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the board of 353737.1 16 directors, in good faith and as described in a resolution of the board of directors) of the portion of the assets or debt securities of the borrower so distributed or of such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities applicable to one share of common stock. such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shares entitled to receive such distribution. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the distribution to holders of common stock of such rights, options, warrants, convertible securities, assets or debt securities if the plan or arrangement under which such rights, options, warrants, convertible securities, assets or debt securities are issued provides for their issuance to the holder of this note in the same pro rata amounts upon conversion thereof. iv. in any case in which this section 5(d) provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the borrower may defer until the occurrence of such event: (1) issuing to the holder of any shares of series a preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the common stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment, and (2) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional share of common stock pursuant to section 5(c). v. for purposes of any computations of aggregate consideration receivable or other consideration pursuant to this section 5, the following shall apply: (1) in the case of the issuance of shares of capital stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the borrower for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; and 353737.1 17 (2) in the case of the issuance of shares of capital stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof), and described in a resolution of the board of directors or such committee. vi. if after an adjustment the holder of this note may, upon conversion of such note, receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the borrower, the borrower shall determine on a fair basis the allocation of the adjusted conversion price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the conversion privilege and the conversion price of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this section 5. vii. in no event shall an adjustment pursuant to this section 5 reduce the conversion price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note. viii. no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the conversion price then in effect. e. effect of reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. if this note is outstanding and there shall occur: i. any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), ii. any consolidation or merger of the borrower with or into another person shall be effected as a result of which holders of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such common stock, or iii. any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the borrower as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other person, 353737.1 18 this note shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance. in any such case, appropriate adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 5. if this section 5(e) applies with respect to a transaction, section 5(d) hereof shall not apply with respect to that transaction. the above provisions of this section 5(e) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers and sales. f. taxes on shares issued. the issuance of stock certificates upon conversion of this note shall be made without charge to the converting the holder of this note for any tax in respect of the issuance thereof. g. reservation of shares; shares to be fully paid; compliance with governmental requirements. the borrower shall reserve, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares, or out of shares held in its treasury, sufficient shares of common stock to provide for the conversion of this note from time to time outstanding. the borrower covenants that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of this note will upon issuance be fully paid and nonassessable by the borrower and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof. h. notice to holders prior to certain actions. i. if: (1) the borrower shall take any action that would require an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to section 5(d) hereof; or (2) any event described in section 5(e) hereof shall occur; or (3) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the borrower shall occur; the borrower shall cause notice of such proposed action or event to be mailed to the holder of this note, as promptly as possible 353737.1 19 but in any event no later than the later of (x) the date 15 days prior to the record date for such proposed action or the effective date of such event or (y) the date on which the borrower first publicly announces such proposed action or event. ii. in any event, such notice shall specify: (1) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such action, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record of common stock are to be determined, or (2) the date on which such proposed event is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such event. 6. note events of default. upon the occurrence of a note event of default, the unpaid principal amount of this note, together with all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, shall become, or may be declared to be, immediately due and payable, upon the conditions and with the effect provided in section 12 of the note purchase agreement. 7. limitation on interest. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event shall the amount or rate of interest (including to the extent applicable any default rate interest or late payment charge) payable, contracted for, charged or received under or in connection with this note, from time to time or for whatever reason, exceed the maximum rate or amount, if any, specified by applicable law. if from any circumstance whatsoever fulfillment of any provision hereof or other documents at the time performance of such provision shall be due shall involve transcending the limit of such validity, and if from any such circumstance the lender shall ever receive an amount deemed interest by applicable law which shall exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing hereunder or on account of any other principal indebtedness of the undersigned to the lender, and not to payment of interest or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness, the excess shall be refunded to the borrower. all sums paid or agreed to be paid by the borrower for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the borrower to the lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full 353737.1 20 term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform through the term hereof. the terms and provisions of this section 7 shall control and supersede every other provision of all agreements between the borrower and the lender and all obligations of the borrower to the lender. 8. enforceability. the borrower acknowledges that this note and the borrower's obligations under this note are and shall at all times continue to be absolute and unconditional in all respects, and shall at all times be a valid, legally binding obligation of the borrower enforceable against borrower in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights or general principles of equity. this note and the note purchase agreement set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the lender and the borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the borrower absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all right to assert any setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever with respect to this note or the obligations of the borrower hereunder in any action or proceeding brought by the lender to collect amounts owing under this note, or any portion thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of the borrower's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim maintained in a court of the united states, or of the state of new york if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of the borrower's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against the lender in any separate action or proceeding. the borrower acknowledges that no oral or other agreements, conditions, promises, understandings, representations or warranties exist with respect to this note or with respect to the obligations of the borrower under this note, except those specifically set forth in this note. 9. waivers and special agreements. the

time, by the lender of any obligation or of any rights or remedies (or to insist upon strict performance) in any one or more instances shall not constitute a waiver thereof (or preclude full exercise or insistence upon strict performance thereof) in that or any other instance, and any single exercise of any such right or remedies in any one or more instances shall not preclude full exercise in any other instance. 10. calculations of amounts due. all calculations of amounts due on any date, whether by acceleration or otherwise, will be made by the lender (or its agent or representative) and the borrower agrees that all such calculations will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. 11. amendments. this note may not be modified, amended, changed or terminated orally, but only by an
