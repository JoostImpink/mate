of the outstanding voting securities of the company, the purchasers will use their best efforts to cause the board of directors to consist of at least nine members and to cause any slate of nominees presented by the company for election as directors to include not less than a number of disinterested directors (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) equal to five-ninths (rounded to the nearest whole number) of all directors. in each such case, the number of disinterested directors to be elected shall be calculated without regard to any directors which the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to elect as a result of the default by company in the payment of six consecutive required quarterly dividends. the stock purchase agreement provides that as long as any of the members of the board of directors of the company are selected by the purchasers, the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the disinterested directors shall be required to take any of the following actions: (i) make any decision to take, or omit to take, any action on the company's behalf with respect to the company's rights and obligations pursuant to the stock purchase agreements or any of the transaction documents (as defined in the stock purchase agreement); (ii) make any decision or take, or omit to take, any action on the company's behalf with respect to the preferred stock, the shares of preferred stock purchased by the purchasers pursuant to the stock purchase agreement (the "shares"), or the company's rights and obligations under the certificate of designation of the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock (the "certificate of designation"); (iii) approve any transactions between the company, on the one hand, and affiliates of the purchasers, or either of them, on the other hand; and (iv) approve the disinterested directors previously nominated by the nominating committee of the board of directors for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders or the board of directors of the company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. the purchasers have also agreed in the stock purchase agreement to vote any shares of preferred stock or conversion shares held by them from time to time in favor of the election of such disinterested directors, and to waive any right to which it would be entitled to elect additional directors in the event of the default by the company in the payment of six consecutive quarterly dividend payments at any time the board of directors of the company is composed of a majority of directors selected by the purchasers. the company has agreed in the stock purchase agreement that the company shall include in the slate of directors elected nominated and recommended by the board of directors of the company one representative designated (i) by trefoil, as long as trefoil, together with its affiliates, owns securities of the company representing at least 10% of the total voting power of all of the company's outstanding securities, and (ii) by gei, as long as gei, together with its affiliates, owns securities of the company representing at least 10% of the total voting power of all of the company's outstanding securities, and that, if such nominee is not elected as a director, to permit a representative of such purchaser to act as a non-voting observer to the board of directors, with equal access to information, and inclusion in meetings, as though such non-voting observer were a member of the board of directors. pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, the purchasers have agreed to vote their shares and conversion shares in favor of an amendment to the company's certificate of 21 incorporation (the "charter amendment") in the form set forth as exhibit 4 hereto, and an amendment to the company's by-laws (the "by-laws amendment") in the form set forth as exhibit 5 hereto. pursuant to the charter amendment, any person who proposes to engage in an extraordinary transaction involving the company must either (i) obtain the approval of at least 75% of the stockholders of the company (other than such person or any affiliates of such person), (ii) obtain the prior approval of at least a majority of the continuing directors (as defined in the charter amendment), or (iii) pay to each of the stockholders in such transaction consideration equal to at least the highest price paid for any share of the company's common stock by such person during the preceding two years (excluding any shares or conversion shares purchased by the purchasers pursuant to the stock purchase agreement). pursuant to the by-laws amendment, any person who desires to have a proposal or any nominees for election as a director of the company presented to or considered by the company's stockholders at any stockholders meeting is required to follow certain procedures, provide certain information to the company and meet certain timing requirements in order for such proposal or nominees to be properly presented to be acted upon. the provisions of this paragraph are qualified in their entirety by the provisions of the charter amendment and the by-laws amendment, the full text of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference and made part hereof. the stock purchase agreement provides that, for so long as the purchasers own at least 50% of the total number of shares purchased by them pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, the purchasers shall have pre-emptive rights with respect to any sale by the company of any shares of its common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its common stock (with certain limited exceptions), in proportion to the shares of preferred stock then held by the purchasers. the stock purchase agreement also provides that until the third anniversary of the principal closing, if one shall have occurred, the purchasers will not sell more than one-third of the shares (or conversion shares issued upon conversion of such shares) purchased by them pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. pursuant to the certificate of designation, the holders of the preferred stock have the right to vote together with the common stock, as a single class, on all matters, including the election of directors, submitted to the company's stockholders for a vote. the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holder of preferred stock is equal to the number of whole votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the shares of common stock into which such shares of preferred stock are convertible on the record date for such vote. in addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, in person or by proxy, at a special or annual meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, shall be necessary to (a) except in connection with the payment of dividends on the preferred stock in additional shares of preferred stock or shares of common stock, authorize, increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by reclassification), any shares of any class or classes, or any series of any class or classes, of the company's capital stock ranking pari passu with or prior to (either as to dividends 22 or upon a change in control of the company, voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up) the preferred stock, (b) except in connection with the payment of dividends on the preferred stock in additional shares of preferred stock or shares of common stock, increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any shares of, preferred stock, (c) alter, amend or repeal any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the company which in any manner would alter, change or otherwise adversely affect in any way the powers, preferences or rights of the preferred stock, (d) approve the sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries (as defined in the certificate of designation), or (e) approve any merger of the company with or into any other entity or any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or other similar transaction (including any issuance of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities by the company, to any person (other than the purchasers and their affiliates) who would then own on a fully diluted basis more than 50% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast (giving effect to such issuance) by holders of the company's capital stock on all matters, including the election of directors) involving the company; provided, however, that the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock shall only have a class vote on the transactions described in clauses (d) and (e) prior to the earlier of the effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act of 1933 relating to all such shares and, following the principal closing date (as defined in the stock purchase agreement), the date on which less than half of the total shares of preferred stock originally issued (not including any shares issued in payment of dividends) remain outstanding. notwithstanding the proviso to the preceding sentence, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, in person or by proxy, at a special or annual meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, shall be necessary to approve any merger of the company with or into any other entity or any reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or other similar transaction involving the company where (i) the preferred stock is not remaining outstanding after such transaction under substantially the same powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as are set forth in the certificate of designation or (ii) the cash, stock, securities or other property to be received on conversion of one share of preferred stock following such transaction and the application of antidilution adjustments to the conversion price (as defined in the certificate of designation) in respect of such transaction has a fair market value at the closing of such transaction less than 150% of the conversion price. if the principal closing date has not occurred on or before december 31, 1996, then, for one year following such date, the company may complete any of the transactions described in clauses (d) and (e) without any class vote of the preferred stock so long as (i) the company shall redeem, at the option of the holder thereof, any shares of preferred stock, at a redemption price equal to 108.5% of the stated value thereof (as defined in the certificate of designation), and (ii) prior to consummating such transaction, the other party or parties to such transaction (including any parent entity thereof) agrees in writing for the benefit of the holders of the preferred stock to provide or cause to be provided the funds for such redemption and to guarantee the company's performance of its obligations in connection with such redemption and provides reasonable evidence of its ability to provide such funds. 23 in addition, if the company shall have failed to pay in full dividends on the preferred stock for six consecutive quarters, the certificate of designation provides that the size of the board of directors of the company shall be increased by two, and the holders of shares of preferred stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the right to elect such two directors. the right to elect such two directors terminates upon payment in full of all dividends payable on the preferred stock, at which time the board of directors shall return to its previous size and the directors elected by the holders of the preferred stock shall be removed. in addition to the voting rights described in the three preceding paragraphs, between the first closing date (as defined in the stock purchase agreement), if one occurs and the principal closing date, the size of the board of directors of the company shall be increased by two, and the holders of shares of preferred stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the right to elect two directors to fill such positions. while the holders of shares of preferred stock are entitled to elect such two directors as described herein, they are not entitled to elect any directors as described in the preceding paragraph. on and after the principal closing date, the voting rights described in this paragraph shall terminate, and thereafter the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to vote with the common stock as previously described in this item 4. pursuant to the certificate of designation, the holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive quarterly dividends in the amount of 8.50% of the stated value (as defined in the certificate of designation) per annum. until the third anniversary of the principal closing, if it shall have occurred, such dividends are payable in additional shares of preferred stock or in shares of common stock from the third anniversary of the principal closing to the fifth anniversary of the principal closing, such dividends are payable in cash, unless the company's bank credit agreement or its 12% senior notes due 2004 shall prohibit such cash payments, in which case such dividends may be paid in additional shares of preferred stock or shares of common stock. to the extent that any dividends on the preferred stock are paid in shares of common stock, the company is required to pay a premium in additional shares of common stock equal to 33- 1/3% of the total number of shares of common stock that would otherwise be paid as the dividend. after the fifth anniversary, all dividends are payable in cash. if the principal closing does not occur, all dividends are payable in cash from the initial issuance of shares of preferred stock. pursuant to a stockholders agreement between the purchasers, the purchasers have each agreed to vote all of their shares and conversion shares in favor of all nominees for election as directors selected by each of them. the purchasers have further agreed that the first and third nominees which the purchasers shall be entitled to select shall be selected by trefoil, the second and fourth nominees which the purchasers shall be entitled to select shall be selected by gei, and any further nominees which the purchasers shall be entitled to select shall be selected by mutual agreement between the purchasers. the purchasers have further agreed thereunder that if either of them shall agree to purchase or sell shares, conversion shares or additional shares of common stock (other than on a public exchange), then the purchaser who shall have entered into such agreement is required to permit the other purchaser to participate in such purchase or sale on a pro rata basis. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, trefoil has 24 agreed that gei shall control the timing of the conversion by the purchasers of preferred stock into conversion shares. while the purchasers do not have any current plans to sell any of the shares or conversion shares, subject to the provisions of the stock purchase agreement and the stockholders agreement referred to above, the purchasers, or either of them, may determine, based on market and general economic conditions, the business affairs and financial condition of the company, the market price of the common stock and other factors deemed relevant by them, or either of them, to sell some or all of the shares, the conversion shares or any other shares of common stock acquired by them after the first closing date (such shares, conversion shares, and additional shares of common stock, the "registrable securities"). pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated as of july 30, 1996 among the company and the purchasers, the company has granted the purchasers the right, subject to certain limitations and restrictions, (i) to require the company to effect a registration of some or all of the purchasers' registrable securities on any form of registration statement then available to the company on four occasions, (ii) to require the company to effect a registration of some or all of the purchasers' registrable securities on a registration statement on form s-3, if one is then available to the company, on an unlimited number of occasions, and (iii) to require the company to include common stock then held by the purchasers in any registration by the company of shares of its common stock under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. the foregoing descriptions of the stock purchase agreement, charter amendment, by-laws amendment, certificate of designation, registration rights agreement and stockholder agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text thereof, filed as exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, hereof, and incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof. the response to item 6 of this schedule 13d is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and made a part hereof. subject to the foregoing and to the responses to items 5 and 6 herein, the purchasers have no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any such transaction, event or action as is enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d promulgated under the exchange act. item 5. interests in securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------- (a) for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, by virtue of the stock purchase agreement, each of trefoil and gei may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of an aggregate of 15,686,200 shares of common stock into which the aggregate 2,000,000 shares to be purchased by them pursuant to the stock purchase agreement are convertible. each of trefoil and gei have agreed pursuant to the stock purchase agreement to purchase 1,000,000 shares, convertible into 7,843,100 shares of common stock. such 15,686,200 shares of 25 common stock, if outstanding, would constitute approximately 61% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. pursuant to the certificate of designation, the initial conversion price (as defined therein) of the shares is $6.375, and is subject to adjustment at the principal closing to the lower of (i) $7.25 and (ii) the greater of (x) $6.50 and (y) 120% of the then applicable fair market value (as defined in the certificate of designation, determined as of the earlier of (1) the fifth business day prior to the principal closing or (2) the second business day prior to the final vote of stockholders, if any, approving the issuance of the preferred stock contemplated to be issued at the principal closing). to the extent the conversion price is increased or decreased, the number of conversion shares will be decreased or increased, respectively. (b) the stock purchase agreement grants to trefoil and gei the right to acquire the shares, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. see items 4 and 6 of this schedule 13d. until trefoil and gei acquire the shares, the shares will remain unissued by the company. upon issuance of the shares, trefoil will have the sole power to direct the vote and disposition of the 1,000,000 shares to be purchased by it and the conversion shares into which such shares are convertible, and gei will have the sole power to direct the vote and disposition of the 1,000,000 shares to be purchased by it and the conversion shares into which such shares are convertible, in each case subject to certain restrictions pursuant to the stockholders agreement as described in items 4 and 6 of this schedule 13d.

(d) no person other than the reporting persons has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. -------------------------------------------------------- the responses set forth in the last paragraph of item 3 and all of item 4 of this schedule 13d are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. the stock purchase agreement provides for the purchase of the shares for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million. the first closing may occur, at the sole option of the 26 purchasers, without regard to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. the principal closing is scheduled to occur as promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions thereto but in no event later than december 31, 1996, unless extended by mutual agreement among the company and the purchasers. the respective obligations of the company and the purchasers at the principal closing are conditioned upon, among other things, the absence of any legal action that would make the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement illegal; the expiration or early termination of any applicable waiting period under the hsr act; and the approval be the company's stockholders having been obtained, if required. the obligations of the purchasers under the stock purchase agreement are further conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt by the company of all consents, approvals, and transfers of permits and licenses required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement; the registration rights agreement and the management services agreement between the company and sca being in full force and effect; the changes to the board of directors described in item 4 hereof; the company not then being a party to any bankruptcy proceeding; and the satisfactory completion of due diligence relating to potential withdrawal liability under two multiemployer benefit plans in which the company participates. the company has covenanted in the stock purchase agreement to, among other things, conduct its business in the ordinary course, obtain stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated under the stock purchase agreement, as required; seek confirmation from the national association of securities dealers, inc. ("nasd") that a vote of the company's stockholders is not required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement; use all reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required in connection with the transactions contemplated under the stock purchase agreement; continue the quotation of the common stock on the nasdaq national market; and make the changes in board composition described in item 4 of this schedule 13d. the company has also agreed in the stock purchase agreement that it will not, through any of its officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents, solicit, initiate or encourage the initiation of any inquiries or proposals, or engage in any negotiations or discussions, regarding any acquisition proposal (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) except as expressly permitted by the stock purchase agreement. the company has agreed to promptly communicate to the purchasers the terms of any proposal received by the company relating to any acquisition proposal. the stock purchase agreement may be terminated at any time (a) by mutual consent of the company (after the first closing, if any, by the disinterested

to sca and geim an aggregate termination fee ranging from (x) $1,300,000 or 108,000 shares of common stock, to be selected by the company, to (y) $2,600,000 or shares of common stock having an aggregate fair market value (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) equal to approximately $3,466,667, depending on the circumstances under which the stock purchase agreement was terminated. pursuant to the rules of the nasd applicable to companies whose securities are quoted on the nasdaq national market, stockholder approval is generally required in connection with an issuance of securities that will result in a change of control of the quoted company. the purchasers propose to seek the support of certain large stockholders of the company in favor of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, through the execution and delivery by such stockholders of ratification and voting agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as exhibit 8. each such agreement, if executed, will confirm that the stockholder executing such agreement will, if it owns shares of the company's common stock on any record date with respect to a vote, consent or proxy relating to the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, vote in favor of such transactions. the nasd has indicated to the purchasers, on an informal basis, that the submission to the nasd of such agreements signed by stockholders holding common stock representing at least a majority of the common stock outstanding may satisfy the nasd's stockholder approval requirement without the need for the company to hold a meeting of its stockholders or to solicit proxies, votes or consents. there can be no assurance that any of the company's stockholders will enter into such agreements, or that the nasd will formally confirm that the company may rely on the existence of such agreements in lieu of holding a meeting of stockholders and soliciting proxies, votes or consents from all of its stockholders for the purpose of approving the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. concurrently with the execution of the stock purchase agreement, the company entered into a three-year management and consulting agreement with sca pursuant to which, commencing on the principal closing date, sca will consult with, and provide advice to, the officers and management employees of the company concerning matters (i) relating to the company's financial policies and the development and implementation of the company's business plans and (ii) generally arising out of the business affairs of the company. sca will render such services to the company on a non-exclusive basis. sca's compensation for such management and consulting services will be $300,000 in the first year of sca's engagement to provide such services (each such year a "service year"), $400,000 in the second service year, and $500,000 in the third service year. the company will reimburse sca (or cause sca to be reimbursed) for all of its reasonable out- of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with the 28 performance of its services under such agreement. in addition to the foregoing compensation, the officers, directors or employees of any of the purchasers or their respective affiliates serving as directors of the company will also be paid customary director fees paid to non-employee directors of the company and will be reimbursed for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith. the foregoing descriptions of the stock purchase agreement, stockholder agreement, the voting and ratification agreements and management services agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text thereof, filed as exhibits 2,

(a) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of class a stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock. the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of a share of class a stock, adjusted as hereinafter provided, is referred to herein as the "conversion ratio." the conversion ratio shall initially be 7.8431 and the conversion price shall initially be $6.375. upon the principal issue date, the conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the lower of (i) $7.25 and (ii) the greater of (x) $6.50 and (y) 120% of the then applicable fair market value (determined as of the earlier of (1) the fifth business day prior to the principal issue date or (2) the second business day prior to the final vote of stockholders, if any, approving the issuance of the class a stock contemplated to be issued on the principal issue date) and the conversion ratio shall be adjusted to equal the greater of (a) 6.8966 and (b) 50 divided by the greater of (x) $6.50 and (y) 120% of the then applicable fair market value (determined as of the earlier of (1) the fifth business day prior to the principal issue date or (2) the second business day prior to the final vote of stockholders, if any, approving the issuance of the class a stock contemplated to be issued on the principal issue date). the conversion ratio and the conversion price are subject to further adjustment from time to time pursuant to section 8(g). (b) conversion of the class a stock may be effected by any such holder upon the surrender to the corporation at the principal office of the corporation in the state of delaware (the "transfer agent") or at the office of any agent or agents of the corporation, as may be designated by the board of directors of the corporation, of the certificate for such class a stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified whole number of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 8 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. in case such notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of common stock in such name or names. other than such taxes, the corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of class a stock pursuant hereto. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the corporation that such taxes have been paid), the corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of common stock to which the holder of shares of class a stock being converted shall be entitled and (ii) if less than the full number of shares of class a stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate 11 or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares being converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of giving such notice and of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of class a stock to be converted (the "conversion date") so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of common stock in accordance herewith, and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of common stock at such time. the corporation shall not be required to convert, and no surrender of shares of class a stock shall be effective for that purpose, while the transfer books of the corporation for the common stock are closed for any purpose (but not for any period in excess of five days); but the surrender of shares of class a stock for conversion during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for conversion immediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the conversion had been made on the date such shares of class a stock were surrendered, and at the conversion ratio in effect at the date of such surrender. (c) in case any shares of class a stock are to be redeemed pursuant to section 5 (with the exception of section 5(f)), such right of conversion shall cease and terminate as to the shares of class a stock to be redeemed at the close of business on the fifth business day next preceding the date fixed for redemption unless the corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption price. (d) the conversion ratio shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in certain instances as hereinafter provided. upon conversion, the holder of shares of class a stock shall be entitled to receive any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of class a stock surrendered for conversion to the conversion date. such accrued and unpaid dividends shall be payable by the corporation, at its option, in cash (to the extent funds are legally available therefor) or in shares of common stock valued at the fair market value as of the third business day prior to the conversion date, instead of in cash. (e) in connection with the conversion of any shares of class a stock, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall either (i) deliver a whole share of common stock in respect of the fractional share to which the holder would otherwise have been entitled upon such conversion or (ii) pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of common stock on the trading day on which such shares of class a stock are deemed to have been converted. if more than one share of class a stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of class a stock so surrendered. (f) the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the class a stock, free from any preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of class a stock, and shall take all action required to 12 increase the authorized number of shares of common stock if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of class a stock. (g) the conversion ratio will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (1) in case the corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the first issue date (a) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, on the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or (d) issue by reclassification of the shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the corporation, then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any shares of class a stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other securities of the corporation which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such shares of class a stock been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the happening of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of such subdivision, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (i) in connection with any transaction to which paragraph (h) applies. (2) in case the corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the first issue date declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution (including, without limitation, any distribution of stock or other securities or property or rights or warrants to subscribe for securities of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries by way of dividend or spinoff), on its common stock, other than dividends or distributions of shares of common stock which are referred to in clause (1) of this paragraph (g), then the conversion ratio shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of class a stock shall be entitled to receive, upon the conversion thereof, the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying (1) the applicable conversion ratio on the day immediately prior to the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share of common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding such record date, and the denominator of which shall be such current market price per share of common stock less the fair market value (as defined in section 11 hereof) per share of common stock (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation, a certified resolution with respect to which shall be mailed to each holder of shares of class a stock) of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that in the event of a distribution of capital stock of a subsidiary of the corporation (a "spin-off") made to holders of shares of common stock, the numerator of such fraction shall be the sum of the current market price per share of common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding the 35th trading day after the effective date of such spin-off and the current market price of 13 the number of shares (or the fraction of a share) of capital stock of the subsidiary which is distributed in such spin-off in respect of one share of common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding such 35th trading day and the denominator of which shall be the current market price per share of common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding such 35th trading day. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (2) shall be made upon the opening of business on the next business day following the date on which any such dividend or distribution is made and shall be effective retroactively immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if the proviso to the preceding sentence applies, then such adjustment shall be made and be effective as of such 35th trading day after the effective date of such spin-off. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (2) in connection with any transaction to which paragraph (h) applies. (3) in case the corporation shall issue shares of common stock (or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) after the first issue date and before the principal issue date at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the current market price as of the date of issuance of such shares or of such convertible securities, then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of class a stock shall be entitled to receive, upon the conversion thereof, the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying (a) the applicable conversion ratio on the day immediately prior to such date by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (2) the number of additional shares of common stock issued (or into which the convertible securities may convert), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (y) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation for the total number of shares of common stock so issued (or into which the rights, warrants or other convertible securities may convert) would purchase at the current market price on such date. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (3) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively immediately after the close of business on such date. for purposes of this clause (3), the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation in connection with the issuance of shares of common stock or of rights, warrants or other securities convertible into shares of common stock shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the aggregate offering price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and expenses payable to third parties) of all such common stock, rights, warrants and convertible securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such, rights, warrants and convertible securities into shares of common stock. the issuance of any shares of common stock pursuant to (a) a dividend or distribution on, or subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the outstanding shares of common stock requiring an adjustment in the conversion ratio pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph (g), or (b) any employee benefit or stock option plan or program of the corporation, or (c) any employment or option agreement with an officer of the corporation (or any of its subsidiaries) and approved by the board of directors or (d) any option, warrant, right, or convertible security, shall not be deemed to constitute an issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the corporation to which this clause (3) applies. in addition, 14 (a) common stock or convertible securities issued to acquire, or in the acquisition of, all or any portion of a business as a going concern, in an arm's length transaction between the company and a third party which is not an affiliate of the company, whether such acquisition shall be effected by purchase of assets, exchange of securities, merger, consolidation or otherwise, or (b) common stock or convertible securities issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, shall not be deemed to constitute an issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the corporation to which this clause (3) applies. upon the expiration unexercised of any options, warrants or rights to convert any convertible securities for which an adjustment has been made pursuant to this clause (3), the adjustments shall forthwith be reversed to effect such rate of conversion as would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such options, warrants or rights or convertible securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (3) in connection with any transaction to which paragraph (h) applies. (4) for purposes of this paragraph (g), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include any shares of common stock then owned or held by or for the account of the corporation. (5) the term "dividend," as used in this paragraph (g) shall mean a dividend or other distribution upon common stock of the corporation. (6) anything in this paragraph (g) to the contrary notwithstanding, the corporation shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment in the conversion ratio unless and until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of which shall be carried forward), determined as above provided, shall have resulted in a change of the conversion ratio by at least one one-hundredth of one share of common stock, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be to change the conversion ratio by a least one one-hundredth of one share of common stock, such change in conversion ratio shall thereupon be given effect. (7) the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing selected by the board of directors of the corporation (which may be the firm of independent public accountants regularly employed by the corporation) shall be presumptively correct for any computation made under this paragraph (g). (8) if the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the right of conversion granted by this paragraph (g) or in the conversion ratio then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record. 15 (9) there shall be no adjustment of the conversion ratio in case of the issuance of any stock of the corporation in a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other similar transaction except as set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) and (3) and (h) of this section 8. (h) in case of any capital reorganization or reclassification of outstanding shares of common stock (other than a reclassification covered by section 8(g)(1)), or in case of any merger of the corporation with or into another corporation, or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of all or substantially all of the assets or property of the corporation (each of the foregoing being referred to as a "transaction"), each share of class a stock then outstanding shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the common stock issuable upon such conversion prior to consummation of such transaction, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash or securities of the surviving person (as defined in section 11 hereof)) upon the consummation of such transaction by a holder of that number of shares of common stock into which one share of class a stock was convertible immediately prior to such transaction (including, on a pro rata basis, the cash, securities or property received by holders of common stock in any tender or exchange offer that is a step in such transaction). in any such case, if necessary, appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth in this section 8 with respect to rights and interests thereafter of the holders of shares of class a stock to the end that the provisions set forth herein for the protection of the conversion rights of the class a stock shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, to any such other shares of stock and other securities and property deliverable upon conversion of the shares of class a stock remaining outstanding (with such adjustments in the conversion price and number of shares issuable upon conversion and such other adjustments in the provisions hereof as the board of directors shall determine to be appropriate). in case securities or property other than common stock shall be issuable or deliverable upon conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this section 8 shall be deemed to apply, so far as appropriate and as nearly as may be, to such other securities or property. notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the corporation will not effect any transaction unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the surviving person thereof shall assume, by written instrument mailed to each holder of shares of class a stock, the obligation to deliver to such holder such cash, property or securities to which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder is entitled.

(d) if for any reason the indemnity under this section 8.1 is unavailable or is insufficient to hold harmless any indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 8.1, then the indemnifying parties shall contribute to the amount paid or payable to the indemnified party as a result of any loss, claim, expense, damage or liability (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof), and legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, expense, damage, liability, action or proceeding, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or the selling holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. if, however, the allocation provided in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the allocation provided in the second preceding sentence provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph (d) of section 8.1 were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph (d) of section 8.1.

(h) the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the rights of any indemnified party to indemnification hereunder or create a presumption that any indemnified party violated any federal or state securities laws. - 21 - (i) in the event that advances are not made pursuant to this section 8.1 or payment has not otherwise been timely made, each indemnified party shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction of the entitlement of the indemnified party to indemnification or advances hereunder. (ii) the company and the selling holders agree that they shall be precluded from asserting that the procedures and presumptions of this section 8.1 are not valid, binding and enforceable. the company and the selling holders further agree to stipulate in any such court that the company and the selling holders are bound by all the provisions of this section 8.1 and are precluded from making any assertion to the contrary. (iii) to the extent deemed appropriate by the court, interest shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party at a reasonable interest rate for amounts which the indemnifying party has not timely paid as the result of its indemnification and contribution obligations hereunder. (i) in the event that any indemnified party is a party to or intervenes in any proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this section 8.1 is at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce the rights of any indemnified party under, or to recover damages for breach of, this section 8.1, the indemnified party, if the indemnified party prevails in whole in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the indemnifying party and shall be indemnified by the indemnifying party against, any expenses incurred by the indemnified party. if it is determined that the indemnified party is entitled to indemnification for part (but not all) of the indemnification so requested, expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of such partial indemnification shall be reasonably prorated among the claims, issues or matters for which the indemnified party is entitled to indemnification and for such claims, issues or matters for which the indemnified party is not so entitled. (j) the indemnity agreements contained in this section 8.1 shall be in addition to any other rights (to indemnification, contribution or otherwise) which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of any registrable securities by any holder. -

and consulting services to the grand union company, a delaware corporation (the "company"), and its subsidiaries for a period of three years commencing on the principal closing date (as that term is defined in the purchase agreement, defined below). we understand that sca is the investment manager for trefoil capital investors ii, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("trefoil"), which is a party to that stock purchase agreement, dated july 30, 1996 (the "purchase agreement"), by and among the company, trefoil and ge investment private placement partners ii, a limited partnership, a delaware limited partnership ("gei") (trefoil and gei to be referred to collectively as the "purchasers"). 1. sca will consult with, and provide advice to, the officers and management employees of the company concerning matters (i) relating to the company's financial policies and the development and implementation of the company's business plans and (ii) generally arising out of the business affairs of the company. it is understood that the company shall have no obligation to follow any of sca's advice. sca shall devote such time as it deems is necessary to perform the services to be rendered by it hereunder, and sca shall not be required to devote any minimum amount of time to the performance of such services. sca may also be retained to provide additional special services to the company as approved from time to time by the independent directors of the company (directors of the company neither affiliated nor associated with any of the purchasers), upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as shall be negotiated in good faith by sca and the company. 2. sca's compensation for management and consulting services hereunder will be $300,000 in the first year of sca's engagement to provide services hereunder (each such year a "service year"), $400,000 in the second service year, and $500,000 in the third service year, such amounts to be payable semiannually in advance in equal installments each service year, with the initial semiannual payment for the first service year to be made on the principal closing date. the company shall also reimburse sca (or cause sca to be reimbursed) for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with the performance of its services hereunder, which shall include the reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel, upon documentation thereof. in addition to the foregoing compensation, the officers, directors or employees of any of the purchasers or their respective affiliates serving as directors of the company will also be paid customary director fees paid to non-employee directors of the company and will be reimbursed for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith. 3. the company has been advised that sca (and its officers and directors) provides consulting, management and other services to trefoil, entities in which trefoil invests, shamrock holdings, inc., a texas corporation ("shamrock"), entities in which shamrock invests, and others and that sca anticipates it will continue to provide such services and similar services to other persons and entities. accordingly, the company acknowledges and agrees that sca shall not be prevented or restricted, in any manner whatsoever, by this letter agreement from providing services (pursuant to a written agreement or otherwise) to any other person or entity and will be supplying services to the company on a non-exclusive basis. 4. the company agrees to indemnify sca and its affiliates in accordance with schedule a, as attached hereto. 5. this letter agreement may be terminated at any time, with or without cause, by sca or the company. termination of this letter agreement by the company shall not relieve the company from its obligations (i) to pay to sca any unpaid portion of the total amount of fees due to sca during the entire stated term of this letter agreement, without giving effect to such termination (including any and all expenses incurred by sca but not yet reimbursed by the company in connection with the performance of services hereunder), which may be paid in one lump sum at the time of termination or in accordance with paragraph 2 hereof, at the company's option, and (ii) to indemnify sca in accordance with the provisions of schedule a hereto, which obligations shall survive any termination of this letter agreement by the company or sca. 6. sca hereby agrees that it will, and will use its best efforts to, cause its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors ("representatives") to, maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained by it or its representatives in connection with its services hereunder; will not disclose such information to any third party (including any other company to which sca provides management services), except for information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by sca or its representatives, (ii) was within sca's possession prior to its being furnished to you by or on behalf of the company pursuant hereto, provided that the source of such information was not known by sca to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the company or any other party with respect to such information or (iii) becomes available to sca on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the company or any of its representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the company or any other party with respect to such information. if this letter accurately sets forth our understanding with respect to the subject matter hereof, please indicate that sca will be bound hereby by executing the enclosed copy of this letter in the space provided and return it to us. very truly yours, the grand union company by: /s/ josesph j. mccaig _____________________________________ name: josesph j. mccaig title: president and chief executive officer agreed to and accepted this 30th day of july, 1996 shamrock capital advisors, inc. by: /s/ jeoffrey t. moore ____________________________ managing director schedule a as part of the consideration for the agreement of shamrock capital advisors, inc., a delaware corporation ("sca"), to furnish its services, the grand union company, a delaware corporation (the "company"), agrees to indemnify and hold harmless sca and its affiliates and the respective partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of, and persons controlling, sca or any of its affiliates within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, or section 20 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and each of their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "indemnified persons") from and against all claims, liabilities, expenses, losses or damages (or actions in respect thereof) related to or arising out of actions taken (or omitted to be taken) by sca pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement, dated july __, 1996, between sca on the one hand and the company on the other (the "letter agreement"), or sca's role in connection therewith; provided, however, that the company shall not be responsible for any claims, liabilities, expenses, losses and damages to the extent that it is finally judicially determined that they result primarily from actions taken or omitted to be taken by sca in bad faith or due to sca's gross negligence or willful misconduct. if for any reason (other than the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of sca as provided above) the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to sca or insufficient to hold sca harmless, then the company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by sca as a result of such claim, liability, expense, loss or damage in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the company on the one hand and sca on the other but also the relative fault of the company and sca, as well as any relevant equitable considerations, subject to the limitations that in any event sca's aggregate contribution to all losses, claims, expenses, liabilities and damages shall not exceed the amount of fees actually received by sca pursuant to the letter agreement. promptly after receipt by sca of notice of any complaint or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification may be sought against the company, sca will notify the company in writing of the receipt or commencement thereof, but failure to notify the company will relieve the company from any liability which it may have hereunder only if, and to the extent that, such failure results in the forfeiture of substantial rights and defenses, and will not in any event relieve the company from any other obligation to any indemnified person other than under this indemnification agreement. the company shall assume the defense of such action (including payment of fees and disbursements of counsel) insofar as such action shall relate to any alleged liability in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the company. sca shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of sca unless employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized by the company in writing. the company shall pay the fees and expenses of one separate counsel for sca and any other indemnified persons if the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include the company (or any of the directors of the company) and sca and (i) in the good faith judgment of sca the use of joint counsel would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of interest, or (ii) sca shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the company (or the director(s)). the company shall not be liable to indemnify any person for any settlement of any claim or action effected without the company's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. in addition, the company agrees to reimburse sca and each other indemnified person for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel if the company does not assume the defense of such action) as they are incurred by sca or any indemnified person in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such action or claim, whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which sca or any such indemnified person is a party. sca shall have no liability to the company or any other person in connection with the services which they render pursuant to the letter agreement, except for sca's bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct judicially determined as aforesaid. the indemnification, contribution and expense reimbursement obligation the company has under this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability the company may otherwise have. -----end privacy-enhanced
