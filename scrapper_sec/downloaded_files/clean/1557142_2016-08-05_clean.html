preferred stock or (ii) issuable upon conversion of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding (the &#147; required investors &#148;) may request, after the issuer is eligible to use form s-3, that the issuer file a shelf registration statement and use commercially reasonable efforts to have the shelf registration statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after its filing or at least within 60 days thereafter relating to the offer and sale of any shares of common stock acquired by the parties pursuant to the exchange agreement, (ii) any shares of common stock acquired by the parties upon a conversion of their shares of preferred stock and (iii) any other securities of the issuer which may be issued or issuable with respect to, in exchange for, or in substitution of such securities (collectively, the &#147; second registrable securities &#148;). in addition, the issuer will be required to effectuate one underwritten takedown offering from the shelf registration statement within any six-month period if requested by the required investors or the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are signatories to the 2015 registration rights agreement (as defined in the second registration rights agreement). the issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until there are no longer any second registrable securities. further, pursuant to the second registration rights agreement, the required investors may demand at any time following 180 days after the effective date of the second registration rights agreement, that the issuer effect the registration of all or any portion of the second registrable securities. notwithstanding the above, the required investors may not make any demand for registration: (i) unless the aggregate proceeds from such demand registration are expected to equal or exceed $15 million, or (ii) during any period beginning on the date that the issuer files a registration statement for common stock (for its own account or for any other security holder) and ending on the earlier of: (a) 90 days after such registration statement is effective, (b) upon the withdrawal of such registration statement or (c) 30 days after the issuer provides notice of its intent to file a registration statement if no such registration statement has been filed within such 30-day period. the issuer may limit the second registrable securities included in an underwritten offering if any of the lead underwriters advises the issuer that it believes the inclusion of all such second registrable securities in the offering would have an adverse effect on the offering. pursuant to the second registration rights agreement, if the issuer at any time proposes to register an offering of any of its securities and such registration may be used to sell any second registrable securities, the issuer will give the investors covered by the second registration rights agreement the opportunity to include such second registrable securities in the offering. if any such investors make a written request to participate in such registration within five business days after receiving the issuer&#146;s notice, the issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to include the second registrable securities of such investors in the offering, subject to cutbacks specified in the second registration rights agreement. the foregoing description of the second registration rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the second registration rights agreement, which is incorporated by reference as exhibit 99.7 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by reference. the reporting
