the required policies for the required period, buyer agrees to purchase and maintain in effect for the required period, at its sole cost and expense, directors' and officers' insurance policies that are no less favorable to the designated directors than the company's directors' and officers' insurance policies in existence on the date hereof, protecting the designated directors with respect to

(i.e., for the required period) is more than $440,000 (such excess herein referred to as "added insurance expense"), then buyer shall notify sellers of the aggregate amount of the added insurance expense, and sellers shall have the option of either (i) requiring buyer to maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage and paying to buyer the amount of the added insurance expense or (ii) waiving any rights to have buyer maintain or procure such coverage. nothing herein shall limit the right of the company to obtain such insurance on its own, whether prior to or after the closing. 6.06. revolving credit facility. tpg and buyer agree that tpg or another lender reasonably acceptable (with respect to such lender's financial condition and its ability to perform its

(b) until this agreement is terminated or until the occurrence of the closing, whichever occurs first, at any meeting of stockholders of the company or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a shareholder's vote, consent or other approval is sought, such shareholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and shall vote (or cause to be voted) its shares against (and shall not execute any written consent in favor of) (i) any merger agreement or merger, consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the company or any other acquisition proposal or (ii) any amendment of the company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would in any manner impede, frustrate, delay, prevent or nullify the transactions contemplated by this agreement or the company restructuring. the shareholders further agree not to commit or agree to take any action inconsistent with the foregoing. 6.09. actions prior to closing. until this agreement is terminated or until the occurrence of the closing, whichever occurs first, sellers shall (i) not take any action which would reasonably be expected to cause any of their representations or warranties to become untrue in a material respect, (ii) not enter into any new loan agreement or other lending instrument with the company unless consented to by tpg and buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), (iii) not materially modify any of the loan agreements, except (a) in connection with the amount or type of collateral (provided that in no event shall such collateral include the buyer pre-closing collateral), (b) increases in amounts permitted to be borrowed, or (c) with the consent of buyer not to be unreasonably withheld, any other modification of the loan agreements and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the company not to (a) pay any amount in respect of any loan, other than regularly scheduled interest substantially as described in schedule 3.06, regularly scheduled commitment fees described in schedule 3.06 or amounts which the company may reborrow or (b) pay any amount in respect of shares, whether by way of dividend, distribution, repurchase or otherwise. in addition, until this agreement is terminated or until the occurrence of the closing, whichever occurs first, the sellers shall not file a petition against the company or any of its subsidiaries under the bankruptcy code, and shall not request or otherwise take any action to cause or encourage the company or any of its subsidiaries to file a petition under the bankruptcy code except in accordance with the by-law described in section 7.18. until this agreement is terminated or until the occurrence of the closing, whichever occurs first, neither tpg nor buyer shall take any action which would reasonably be expected to cause any of their representations or warranties to become untrue in a material respect. 6.10. available e.on credit facilities. on or prior to october 15, 2001, e.on ag may, but shall have no obligation to amend the secured loan agreement so that the amount permitted to be borrowed under the available e.on credit facilities shall be increased by an amount to be determined in the sole discretion of e.on ag. unless and until a funding termination event shall have occurred, and subject to the terms of this section 6.10 and the terms of section 6.13, the company shall be permitted to borrow pursuant to the available e.on credit facilities an amount equal to the maximum amount which may be borrowed pursuant to the available e.on credit facilities. 6.11. funding.

(b) if the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any third-party claim, the indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense or prosecution thereof. such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's reasonable request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

("memc"), and each of the memc subsidiaries listed on schedule i hereto (each, individually, a "subsidiary," and collectively, the "subsidiaries"). recitals 1. wafer holdings has elected, pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.7701-3(c), to be classified as a corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes. wafer holdings, memc and the subsidiaries are members ("members") of an affiliated group (the "affiliated group"), as defined in section 1504(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986 (the "code"), for the taxable year ending december 31, [ ]. all references in this agreement to provisions of the code or the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, including proposed treasury regulations, shall include any corresponding successor provisions. 2. it is the intent and desire of the parties hereto that a method be established for allocating the federal and state consolidated tax liability of the affiliated group among its members in those jurisdictions in which a consolidated or combined return is required or permitted to be filed, for reimbursing wafer holdings for payment of such tax liability, for compensating any member for use of its losses or tax credits, and to provide for the allocation and payment of any refund arising from a carryback of losses or tax credits from subsequent taxable years. agreement now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. filing of returns. a u.s. consolidated income tax return and estimated tax returns shall be prepared and filed by wafer holdings for the taxable year ending december 31, [ ], and for each subsequent taxable period in respect of which the affiliated group is required or permitted to file a u.s. consolidated income tax return. with respect to such tax return preparation, wafer holdings shall act in good faith with regard to all members included in an applicable return and shall include within such consolidated tax return all members currently included within the memc consolidated group unless a contrary treatment is required by law. wafer holdings shall have the right with respect to any consolidated tax returns to determine in good faith (i) the manner in which such returns, documents or statements shall be prepared and filed, including, without limitation, the manner in which any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit shall be reported, (ii) whether any extensions should be requested, and (iii) the elections that will be made by any member of the affiliated group. in addition, wafer holdings shall have the right, in good faith, to (i) contest, compromise, or settle any adjustments or deficiency proposed, asserted or assessed as a result of any audit of any u.s. consolidated income tax return, (ii) file, prosecute, compromise or settle any claim for refund, and (iii) determine whether any refunds shall be received by way of refund or credited against tax liabilities. finally, in preparing the u.s. consolidated income tax returns, wafer holdings will reasonably request information from members of the affiliated group, specifying deadlines for receiving the requested information. the members of the affiliated group will comply with the information request within the specified deadline, unless an alternative deadline is arranged with wafer holdings. 2. allocation of tax liability. wafer holdings, memc and subsidiaries agree that, for purposes of this agreement, the consolidated tax liability for each year beginning with the taxable year ending december 31, [ ], determined in accordance with treasury regulations section 1.1502-2, shall be apportioned among them in accordance with the provisions of treasury regulations sections 1.1552-1(a)(2) (tax liability is allocated in proportion to separate tax liabilities) and 1.1502-33(d)(2) (the "wait-and-see method"). accordingly, the tax liability shall first be allocated to the several members on the basis of the percentage of the total tax that the tax of such member if computed on a separate return would bear to the total amount of taxes for all members so computed pursuant to section 1552(a)(2) of the code and treasury regulations section 1.1552-1(a)(2). then, under treasury regulations section 1.1502-33(d)(2), if a member had tax attributes that were absorbed by the affiliated group in a prior year and that member would have been able to use those tax attributes in the current taxable year on a separate return basis, the portion of that member's tax liability for the current taxable year that would not have arisen if such tax attributes had been available to that member will be reallocated to other members as provided for under treasury regulations section 1.1502-33(d)(2). for purposes of this agreement, the u.s. consolidated income tax liability shall include any liability for alternative minimum tax ("amt"). such consolidated amt shall be apportioned among the members in accordance with the provisions of proposed treasury regulations section 1.1552-1(g). accordingly, the amt liability shall be allocated to the several members on the basis of the percentage of the total consolidated amt that the separate adjusted amt of such member, if computed as provided in proposed treasury regulations section 1.1502-55(h)(6)(iv), would bear to the total amount of such separate adjusted amts for all members so computed. 3. payment of tax. memc and each subsidiary shall pay to wafer holdings no later than 2 business days before the date on which the affiliated group's u.s. consolidated income tax return is required to be filed (taking account of any extensions thereof) its separate return tax liability determined as provided under section 2 above plus its "equitable share" (as defined below) of any interest or penalties shown on the return. to the extent that the interest and penalties shown on a return are directly related to items of income, deduction, credit, etc. of a particular member, or such member's delay in providing information to wafer holdings as provided in section 1 above, that member's equitable share of such interest and penalties is 100%. each member's equitable share of any interest and penalties shown on the return that are not directly related to the items or delay of a particular member (and so allocated to that particular member) will be a ratable share of any such interest or penalties, determined by multiplying such interest or penalties by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the portion of the affiliated group's tax liability allocated to such member (before interest or penalties) and the denominator of which equals the affiliated group's tax liability (before interest or penalties). 4. carryforward/carryback of losses and credits. if part or all of an unused loss or tax credit is allocated to a member pursuant to treasury regulations sections 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-79, and it is carried back or forward to a year in which such member filed a separate return or a consolidated return with another affiliated group, (i) any refund or reduction in tax liability arising from the carryback or carryover shall be retained by such member and (ii) if such loss is a srly item and was taken into account by such member in determining its separate return tax liability for any year pursuant to section 2 of this agreement, the computation pursuant to section 2 shall be redetermined by excluding such srly item and such member shall pay the difference between the redetermined amount and the amount previously paid by it pursuant to section 2 upon the earlier of the realization of any refund or reduction in tax liability arising from the carryback, the member becoming a former member, or the expiration of the srly, and such amount shall be credited to the members to which such amount is attributable pursuant to section 2. notwithstanding the foregoing, wafer holdings shall determine whether an election shall be made (i) not to carry back any portion of any net operating loss arising in a u.s. consolidated return year (including any portion allocated to a member under treasury regulations section 1.1502-21) in accordance with code section 172(b)(3), and (ii) to reattribute to itself any portion of any net operating loss or capital loss carryover attributable to memc or a subsidiary, to the extent permitted by treasury regulations section 1.1502-20(g). memc and each subsidiary agrees to join with wafer holdings in filing any necessary elections under treasury regulations section 1.1502-20(g). 5. estimated tax payments. if the affiliated group is required to make estimated federal income tax payments (including payment due at the time any extension of time is sought for the filing of the affiliated group's federal income tax return), memc and each subsidiary shall, if requested by wafer holdings, pay to wafer holdings, no later than 2 business days before the date each estimated tax payment is to be made by wafer holdings, that percentage of the estimated tax payment that equals the percentage which the estimated separate return tax liability of such member bears to the aggregate of the members' estimated separate return tax liabilities for the taxable year computed as provided under section 2 above. wafer holdings shall determine, or cause memc to determine, such estimates. any estimated tax payments made by memc or a subsidiary under this section 5 with respect to any taxable year shall be applied to reduce the amount, if any, owed by such member under section 3 hereof with respect to such year. any excess of such estimated payments by memc or a subsidiary over the amount described in section 3 for such year shall be repaid by wafer holdings to such member no later than 10 business days after the date of filing of the consolidated return for such taxable year or, to the extent such excess represents all or a part of a tax refund to be received by the affiliated group, no later than 10 business days after the receipt of the refund. 6. adjustments to tax liability. if the u.s. consolidated income tax liability is adjusted for any taxable period, whether pursuant to an amended return, a claim for refund, a tax audit by the internal revenue service or some other reason, the liability of each member shall be recomputed to give effect to such adjustments, and in the case of a refund, wafer holdings shall make payment to each member for its share of the refund, determined in the same manner as in section 2 above, within 10 business days after the refund is received by wafer holdings, and in the case of an increase in tax liability, each member shall pay to wafer holdings its allocable share of such increased tax liability (including its equitable share of any interest and penalties) within 10 business days after receiving notice of such liability from wafer holdings. the parties recognize that a recomputation of the consolidated tax liability for any taxable year under this section 6 is not necessarily the final liability for such year, and such liability may be recomputed more than once. 7. new members of affiliated group. if during a consolidated return period wafer holdings, memc or any subsidiary acquires or organizes another corporation that is required to be included in the affiliated group's u.s. consolidated income tax return, then such corporation shall join in and be bound by this agreement. 8. termination of agreement. this agreement shall apply to all taxable periods as to which a u.s. consolidated income tax return is filed by wafer holdings and any other member unless wafer holdings and all the other members agree in writing to terminate the agreement, except that this agreement shall be terminated with respect to memc or any subsidiary that ceases to be included in the affiliated group but continues to be a corporation subject to federal income tax ("former member"). notwithstanding any such termination, this agreement shall continue in effect with respect to all taxable periods prior to termination, including any payments or refunds relating to such periods. 9. post-consolidated return period. notwithstanding the termination of this agreement with respect to one or more subsidiaries, wafer holdings and any former member shall furnish each other with all information and assistance as shall reasonably be requested (including, without limitation, returns, supporting schedules, work papers, correspondence and other documents) relating to the tax liability of the affiliated group or such former member for any taxable year in which the former member was included in the affiliated group. moreover, wafer holdings and the former member shall furnish each other with information and assistance required, and shall take all steps necessary, to apply for and obtain the benefit of any carryback of a net operating or capital loss or any investment, foreign tax or other credit of the former member to a taxable year in which the former member was included in the affiliated group and a u.s. consolidated income tax return was filed. 10. audits and refund claims. wafer holdings and a former member shall also consult and furnish each other with information concerning the status of any tax audit or tax refund claim relating to a taxable year in which the former member was included in the affiliated group and a u.s. consolidated income tax return was filed. wafer holdings shall have the right to make the final determination as to the response of the affiliated group to any audit and shall have the sole right to control any contest of any change proposed and any proposed disallowance of a refund claim by the internal revenue service through the appeals office of the internal revenue service and the courts in connection with any taxable year for which this agreement is in effect. each member shall bear an equitable share of the cost of any such contest (including fees and expenses of outside accountants, lawyers or other experts). 11. settlement of disputes. a dispute or difference between wafer holdings and a former member with respect to the operation or interpretation of this agreement shall be decided by three arbitrators. wafer holdings and the former member shall each select one arbitrator and the arbitrators selected by the parties shall select a third arbitrator. the decision of such arbitrators shall be final. the fees of such arbitrators shall be borne equally by wafer holdings and the former member. 12. elections. wafer holdings shall have the sole authority to make any or all elections available under the code, treasury regulations and any applicable state or local income tax code, law or statute. 13. state and local income taxes. the principles underlying the rights and obligations hereunder of the members in respect of federal income taxes shall be applied in respect of any state or local tax (however denominated) based on or measured by all or any part of the net income or loss of the affiliated group or several of its members (a "combined tax"). all of the procedural and timing requirements of this agreement applicable to federal income taxes shall be equally applicable to any combined tax, with appropriate adjustments thereto to reflect the differences, if any, in corresponding provisions of the applicable income tax code, law or statute governing any such combined tax and any administrative provisions relating thereto. notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall require an affirmative election to file a consolidated or combined state or local return, which election shall be made by wafer holdings in its sole discretion. 14. entire agreement. this agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein. no alteration, amendment or modification of any of the terms of this agreement shall be valid unless made by an instrument signed in writing by an authorized officer of each party. 15. binding agreement. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors and assigns. 16. other agreements. notwithstanding the terms of this agreement, the tax sharing agreement between memc and memc southwest, inc. dated as of june 30, 1995 shall remain in effect. 17. severability. whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision or portion of any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained therein. 18. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of new york. 19. counterparts. this agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. in witness whereof, the parties hereto have caused their names to be subscribed and executed by their respective authorized officers as of the date first written above. tpg wafer holdings llc by: ------------------------------------------ name: title: memc electronic materials, inc.

actual number of days elapsed in the period for which payable. b. accumulation. dividends on the series a preferred stock shall be cumulative, and from and after any dividend payment date on which any dividend that has accumulated or been deemed to have accumulated through such date has not been paid in full or any payment date set for a redemption on which such redemption payment has not been paid in full, additional dividends shall accumulate in respect of the amount of such unpaid dividends or unpaid redemption payment (such amount, the "arrearage") as provided in section a of this article iii; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section a of this article iii, (i) if dividends on the series a preferred stock are not paid on any dividend payment date, dividends shall be deemed to have accumulated, and shall accumulate, at a rate of 12.00% per annum (or such lesser rate as may be the maximum rate that is then permitted by applicable law) (the "arrearage rate") from the beginning of the quarterly period for which such dividends are payable through the date on which such arrearage is paid in full and (ii) if a redemption payment with respect to series a preferred stock is not paid in full on the payment date set for such redemption payment, additional dividends shall accumulate on such unpaid redemption payment at the arrearage rate from the date set for such redemption through the date on which such arrearage is paid in full. such additional dividends in respect of any arrearage shall be deemed to accumulate from day to day whether or not earned or declared until the arrearage is paid, shall be calculated as of such successive dividend payment date and shall constitute an additional arrearage from and after any such successive dividend payment date to the extent not paid on such dividend payment date. if any arrearage has not been paid in full prior to any payment date set for a redemption of series a preferred stock, for the purposes of calculating accrued and unpaid dividends on the stated value of the shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed, the arrearage rate shall apply. references in any article herein to dividends that have accumulated or that have been deemed to have accumulated with respect to the series a preferred stock shall include the amount, if any, of any arrearage together with any dividends accumulated or deemed to have accumulated on such arrearage pursuant to the immediately preceding two sentences. additional dividends in respect of any arrearage may be declared and paid at any time, in whole or in part, without reference to any regular dividend payment date, to registered holders as they appear on the stock record books of the corporation on such record date as may be fixed by the board of directors (which record date shall be no less than 10 days prior to the corresponding payment date). c. method of payment. dividends paid on the shares of series a preferred stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accumulated and payable on all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares then outstanding. any such partial payment shall be made in cash. dividends that are declared and paid in an amount less than the full amount of dividends accumulated on the series a preferred stock (and on any arrearage) shall be applied first to the earliest dividend which has not theretofore been paid. all cash payments of dividends on the shares of series a preferred stock shall be made in such coin or currency of the united states of america as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. iv. liquidation preference in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of then-outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the corporation, whether such assets are capital or surplus of any nature, an amount per share equal to (i) in the event the shareholder approval is required to be obtained pursuant to the applicable rules, interpretations, rulings or determinations of the nyse, (a) prior to the shareholder approval date, the greater of (1) the sum of (x) the dividends, if any, accumulated or deemed to have accumulated thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, whether or not such dividends are declared and (y) the stated value thereof, and (2) the amount that would be payable to holders of the series a preferred stock if the shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (assuming the shareholder approval is not required or had been obtained) and (b) on and following the shareholder approval date, the amount set forth in clause (i)(a)(1) above, and (ii) in the event the shareholder approval is not so required to be obtained, on and following the date of issuance of the series a preferred stock, the amount set forth in clause (i)(a)(1) above, and in each case no more, before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any junior liquidation securities. after any such payment in full, the holders of series a preferred stock shall not, as such, be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets of the corporation. all the assets of the corporation available for distribution to stockholders after the liquidation preferences of any senior liquidation securities, if any, shall be distributed ratably (in proportion to the full distributable amounts to which holders of series a preferred stock and parity liquidation securities, if any, are respectively entitled upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up) among the holders of the then-outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and parity liquidation securities, if any, when such assets are not sufficient to pay in full the aggregate amounts payable thereon. neither a consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into any other person or persons, nor a sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer of all or part of the corporation's assets for cash, securities or other property to a person or persons shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation for purposes of this article iv entitling the series a preferred stock to a liquidation preference hereunder, but the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall nevertheless be entitled from and after any such consolidation, merger or sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer of all or part of the corporation's assets to the rights in respect of a liquidation provided by this article iv following any such transaction. notice of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable to each holder of shares of series a preferred stock in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 45 days prior to any payment date stated therein, to holders of record as they appear on the stock record books of the corporation as of the date such notices are first mailed. v. mandatory redemption a. mandatory redemption. the series a preferred stock shall not be redeemable except as provided in this article v. at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock, the series a preferred stock, shall, to the extent that the corporation shall have funds legally available therefore, be redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the holders of the series a preferred stock at a redemption price per share in cash (the "mandatory redemption price") equal to the stated value plus all unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to the date of actual payment of the mandatory redemption price, whether or not such dividends have been declared. b. mandatory redemption notice and redemption procedures. if any holder of series a preferred stock desires to exercise such holder's redemption right pursuant to section a of this article v, such holder shall give written notice to the corporation stating such holder's election and specifying the number of shares to be redeemed pursuant to section a of this article v (the "mandatory redemption notice"). within 10 days after the receipt of such mandatory redemption notice, the corporation shall give written notice to such holder, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at such holder's address as it appears on the records of the corporation (which notice shall be accompanied by a facsimile transmission thereof to those holders who shall so request): (i) notifying such holder of the date fixed for redemption (which shall not be later than 30 days after the receipt by the corporation of the mandatory redemption notice) (the "mandatory redemption date"); (ii) stating that the series a preferred stock may be converted until the close of business on the business day prior to the mandatory redemption date by surrendering to the corporation or its transfer agent for the series a preferred stock the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, accompanied by written notice specifying the number of shares to be converted, and stating the name and address of the transfer agent of the series a preferred stock, if any; and (iii) stating that dividends shall cease to accrue on the mandatory redemption date unless the corporation defaults in the payment of the mandatory redemption price. the corporation shall redeem the number of shares of series a preferred stock so specified in the mandatory redemption notice on the mandatory redemption date. c. change in control. in the event there occurs a change in control, any holder of record of shares of series a preferred stock, in accordance with the procedures set forth in section d of this article v, may require the corporation to redeem any or all of the shares of series a preferred stock held by such holder in an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the amount, if any, of all unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to the date of actual payment thereof, whether or not such dividends have been declared, and (ii) 101% of stated value (the "change in control price"). d. change in control notice and redemption procedures. notice of any change in control shall be sent to the holders of record of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock not more than ten days following a change in control, which notice (a "change in control notice") shall describe the transaction or transactions constituting such change in control and set forth each holder's right to require the corporation to redeem any or all shares of series a preferred stock held by him or her out of funds legally available therefor, the redemption date, which date shall be not more than 30 days from the date of such change in control notice (the "change in control redemption date"), and the procedures to be followed by such holders in exercising his or her right to cause such redemption; provided, however, that if shares of series a preferred stock are owned by more than 50 holders or groups of affiliated holders and if the series a preferred stock is listed on any national securities exchange or quoted on any national quotation system, the corporation shall give such change in control notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the borough of manhattan, the city of new york, within 30 days following such change in control and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed concurrently to each holder of shares of series a preferred stock. failure by the corporation to give the change in control notice as prescribed by the preceding sentence, or the formal insufficiency of any such change in control notice, shall not prejudice the rights of any holder of shares of series a preferred stock to cause the corporation to redeem any such shares held by him or her. in the event a holder of shares of series a preferred stock shall elect to require the corporation to redeem any or all such shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to section c of this article v, such holder shall deliver, prior to the change in control redemption date as set forth in the change in control notice, or, if the change in control notice is not given as required by this section d, at any time following the last day the corporation was required to give the change in control notice in accordance with this section d (in which case the change in control redemption date shall be the date which is the later of (x) 30 days following the last day the corporation was required to give the change in control notice in accordance with this section d and (y) 15 days following the delivery of such election by such holder), a written notice, in the form specified by the corporation (if the corporation did in fact give the notice required by this section d), to the corporation so stating, and specifying the number of shares to be redeemed pursuant to section c of this article v; provided, however, that if all of the shares of the series a preferred stock are owned by 50 or fewer holders or groups of affiliated holders, such holders or groups may deliver a notice or an election to redeem at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of a change in control without awaiting receipt of a change in control notice or the expiration of the time allowed for the delivery of a change in control notice hereunder. the corporation shall redeem the number of shares so specified on the change in control redemption date fixed by the corporation or as provided in the preceding sentence. the corporation shall comply with the requirements of rules 13e-4 and 14e-1 under the exchange act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the shares of series a preferred stock as a result of a change in control. from and after the time the change in control redemption price is paid in accordance with the terms hereof with respect to any share of series a preferred stock, all dividends on such share of series a preferred stock shall cease to accumulate and all rights of the holder thereof as a holder of series a preferred stock shall cease and terminate. e. deposit of funds. the corporation shall, no later than 11:00 a.m., new york city time, on any mandatory redemption date or change in control redemption date pursuant to this article v, deposit with its transfer agent or other redemption agent in the borough of manhattan, the city of new york having a capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed, cash that is sufficient in amount to redeem the shares to be redeemed in accordance with the mandatory redemption notice or change in control notice, with irrevocable instructions and authority to such transfer agent or other redemption agent to pay to the respective holders of such shares, as evidenced by a list of such holders certified by an officer of the corporation, the mandatory redemption price or change in control redemption price, as the case may be, upon surrender of their respective share certificates. such deposit shall be deemed to constitute full payment of such shares to the holders, and from and after the date of such deposit, all rights of the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock that are to be redeemed as stockholders of the corporation with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the mandatory redemption price or change in control price, as applicable, upon the surrender of their respective certificates and all rights under articles viii and x, shall cease and terminate. in case holders of any shares of series a preferred stock called for redemption shall not, within two years after such deposit, claim the cash deposited for redemption thereof, such transfer agent or other redemption agent shall, upon demand, pay over to the corporation the balance so deposited. thereupon, such transfer agent or other redemption agent shall be relieved of all responsibility to the holders thereof and the sole right of such holders, with respect to shares to be redeemed, shall be to receive the mandatory redemption price or change in control price, as applicable, as general creditors of the corporation. any interest accrued on any funds so deposited shall belong to the corporation, and shall be paid to it from time to time on demand. vi. restrictions on dividends so long as any shares of the series a preferred stock are outstanding, the board of directors shall not declare, and the corporation shall not pay or set apart for payment any dividend on any junior securities or parity securities or make any payment on account of, or set apart for payment money for a sinking or other similar fund for, the repurchase, redemption or other retirement of, any junior securities or parity securities or any warrants, rights or options exercisable for or convertible into any junior securities or parity securities (other than the repurchase, redemption or other retirement of debentures or other debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable into any junior securities or parity securities), or make any distribution in respect of the junior securities or parity securities, either directly or indirectly, and whether in cash, obligations or shares of the corporation or other property (other than distributions or dividends in junior securities to the holders of junior securities), and shall not permit any person directly or indirectly controlled by the corporation to purchase or redeem any junior securities or parity securities or any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into any junior securities or parity securities (other than the repurchase, redemption or other retirement of debentures or other debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable into any junior securities or parity securities) unless prior to or concurrently with such declaration, payment, setting apart for payment, repurchase, redemption or other retirement or distribution, as the case may be, all accumulated and unpaid dividends on shares of the series a preferred stock not paid on the dates provided for in section a of article iii (including arrearages and accumulated dividends thereon and regardless of whether the corporation shall have had the right to elect to defer such payments as provided for in article iii) shall have been paid, except that when dividends are not paid in full as aforesaid upon the shares of series a preferred stock, all dividends declared on the series a preferred stock and any series of parity dividend securities shall be declared and paid pro rata so that the amount of dividends so declared and paid on series a preferred stock and such series of parity dividend securities shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends (including interest accrued on or additional dividends accumulated in respect of such accumulated dividends) on the shares of series a preferred stock and such parity dividend securities bear to each other. notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph shall not prohibit (i) the acquisition, repurchase, exchange, conversion, redemption or other retirement for value of shares of series a preferred stock or any parity dividend security by the corporation in accordance with the terms of such securities or (ii) the acquisition, repurchase, exchange, conversion, redemption or other retirement for value by the corporation of any junior dividend securities by the corporation in accordance with obligations in existence at the time of original issuance of the series a preferred stock. vii. voting rights a. the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall have no voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by law. b. from and after the shareholder approval date, for so long as any shares of the series a preferred stock are outstanding, each share of series a preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by holders of common stock, and the shares of series a preferred stock shall vote together with shares of common stock as a single class. with respect to any such vote, each share of series a preferred stock shall entitle its holder to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series a preferred stock would be convertible at the time of the record date with respect to such vote (assuming all conditions precedent to such conversion have been satisfied and that such conversion had occurred as of the record date for such vote). c. so long as (i) at least $130,000,000 in stated value of the series a preferred stock remains outstanding and (ii) the investor or any of its affiliates beneficially owns, in the aggregate, greater than 50% of the series a preferred stock, in the event that one or more of the board nominees required to be designated for election to the board of directors pursuant to the restructuring agreement are not so designated or are not elected to the board of directors, then the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall, without further action, be increased by the number of such board nominees not elected to the board of directors pursuant to the restructuring agreement, or if such requisite increase in the number of directors constituting the board of directors would require the approval of the corporation's stockholders or is prohibited by the restructuring agreement, then a number of directors (other than board nominees) shall resign from the board of directors, so as to enable the investor and its affiliates to designate as directors the number of board nominees not elected to the board of directors pursuant to the restructuring agreement, and the investor and its affiliates shall have, in addition to the other voting rights set forth herein, the exclusive right, voting separately as a single class, to elect a number of directors to the board of directors equal to the number of such board nominees not elected to the board of directors. directors elected pursuant to this section c shall continue as directors and such additional voting right shall continue until such time as the requisite number of board nominees are elected to the board of directors pursuant to the restructuring agreement, at which time the directors elected by the investor and its affiliates pursuant to this section c shall cease to be directors (unless elected as board nominees), and such additional voting rights shall terminate subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above. d. (a) the foregoing rights of holders of shares of series a preferred stock to take any action as provided in this article vii may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders held for such purpose as hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or, subject to the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, by the written consent, delivered to the secretary of the corporation, of the holders of the minimum number of shares required to take such action. so long as such right to vote continues (and unless such right has been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to take such action), the chairman of the board of directors may call, and upon the written request of holders of record of 20% of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, addressed to the secretary of the corporation at the principal office of the corporation, shall call, a special meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote as provided herein. such meeting shall be held as soon as reasonably practicable after delivery of such request to the secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the by-laws for the holding of meetings of stockholders. (b) each director elected pursuant to section c of this article vii shall serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, unless the director's term of office shall have terminated pursuant to the provisions of section c hereof. in case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected pursuant to section c hereof, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by vote of the remaining director or directors theretofore elected pursuant to section c of this article vii (or such director's or directors' successor in office), if any. if any such vacancy is not so filled within 20 days after the creation thereof or if all of the directors so elected shall cease to serve as directors before their term shall expire, the holders of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for such director pursuant to the provisions of section c of this article vii may elect successors to hold office for the unexpired terms of any vacant directorships, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided herein. the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote for directors pursuant to section c of this article vii shall have the right to remove with or without cause at any time and replace any directors such holders have elected pursuant to such section, by written consent as herein provided, or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided herein. e. without the consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, voting separately as a class, the corporation shall not: (i) authorize, create (by reclassification or otherwise) or issue, or increase the authorized amount of, (a) any senior securities, parity securities or additional series a preferred stock or (b) any class or series of capital stock or any security convertible into or exercisable for any class or series of capital stock, that is redeemable mandatorily or redeemable at the option of the holder thereof at any time on or prior to the redemption of the series a preferred stock (whether or not only upon the occurrence of a specified event); (ii) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws, if the amendment, alteration or repeal alters or changes the powers, preferences or special rights of the series a preferred stock so as to affect them adversely; or (iii) authorize or take any other action if such action would be inconsistent with the provisions of this certificate of designations. f. other agreements and securities. subject to section g of article x, the corporation shall not, from and after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock, enter into any agreement, amend or modify any existing agreement or obligation, or issue any security that prohibits, conflicts or is inconsistent with, or would be breached by, the corporation's performance of its obligations hereunder. viii. conversion a. conversion. (a) at the option and election of the holder thereof, each share of series a preferred stock, including all unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to the conversion date (as defined below), whether or not such dividends have been declared, may be converted in the manner and subject to the limitations provided herein at any time into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock. as of the conversion date with respect to a share of series a preferred stock, subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section a, such share shall be converted into that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient of (i) the sum of (a) the stated value plus (b) all unpaid dividends accumulated on such share of series a preferred stock to the conversion date whether or not such dividends have been declared, divided by (ii) the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. (b) conversion of shares of the series a preferred stock may be effected by any holder thereof upon the surrender to the corporation at the principal office of the corporation or at the office of any agent or agents of the corporation, as may be designated by the board of directors of the corporation and identified to the holders in writing upon such designation, of the certificate for such shares of series a preferred stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified whole number of shares represented by such certificate in accordance with the provisions of this section a and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. in case such notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of common stock in such name or names. other than such taxes, the corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of series a preferred stock pursuant hereto. as promptly as practical, and in any event within three business days after the conversion date, the corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered as directed by the holder of shares of series a preferred stock being converted (i) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled, (ii) any cash that is required to be paid pursuant to subsection (d) of this section a, and (iii) if less than the full number of shares of series a preferred stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares of series a preferred stock evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares of series a preferred stock being converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date (the "conversion date") of the giving of such notice by the holder of the series a preferred stock to be converted and of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of series a preferred stock to be converted so that as of such time the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of common stock and/or cash in accordance herewith, and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock issued as a result of such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as having become the holder of such shares of common stock at such time. (c) in the event that the series a preferred stock is to be redeemed pursuant to article v, from and after the mandatory redemption date or change in control redemption date, as applicable, the right of a holder to convert shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to this section a shall cease and terminate, except if the corporation shall default in payment of the mandatory redemption price on the mandatory redemption date or the change in control redemption price on the change in control redemption date, in which case all such rights shall continue unless and until such shares are redeemed and such price is paid in full in accordance with the terms hereof. notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if the conversion date shall occur with respect to any shares of series a preferred stock on or prior to any mandatory redemption date or change in control redemption date, such shares of series a preferred stock shall be converted by the corporation into common stock in the manner provided in this section a. (d) in connection with the conversion of any shares of series a preferred stock, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the closing price per share of common stock on the conversion date (or on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date, if the conversion date is not a trading day). if more than one share of series a preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder on the same conversion date, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of series a preferred stock so surrendered. (e) to the extent the shareholder approval is required to be obtained pursuant to applicable rules, interpretations, rulings or determinations of the nyse, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section a, in the event that a conversion date with respect to a share of series a preferred stock occurs on a date before which the shareholder approval has been obtained, the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series a preferred stock shall be converted shall not exceed the quotient of (i) the number of shares of common stock that is equal to 19.9% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the closing date (as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the common stock) divided by (ii) 260,000 (as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the series a preferred stock), and, with respect to any such conversion with a conversion date occurring after february 28, 2002, upon delivery of such shares of common stock in accordance with the terms hereof, the corporation shall pay in cash to the holder of such share of series a preferred stock the amount, if any, equal to the closing price of the common stock on the conversion date (or, if the conversion date is not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day) multiplied by the number of shares of common stock that would have been received upon conversion pursuant to this article viii that is in excess of the actual number of shares of common stock received as a result of the operation of this subsection (e). (f) the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms hereof, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. b. adjustment of conversion price. except in connection with an organic change, which shall be subject to section c below, the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) stock dividends. in case the corporation after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock shall pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of shares of common stock in shares of common stock, then in any such case the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be reduced to a price obtained by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on such record date and (y) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares of common stock outstanding and the total number of shares of common stock constituting such dividend or distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such record date. for purposes of this subsection (a), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. the corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the corporation. (b) stock splits and reverse splits. in case after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case after the original issuance of the series a preferred stock outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (c) issuances below conversion price. (i) if the corporation after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock issues common stock without consideration or at a price per share (such no consideration or price per share, the "new price per share") less than the conversion price in effect immediately preceding such issuance of common stock, then the conversion price shall be adjusted effective immediately following such issuance of common stock to the new price per share; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made if such common stock is issued to holders of common stock and the corporation issues or distributes to each holder of series a preferred stock the common stock that each such holder would have been entitled to receive had the series a preferred stock held by such holder been converted prior to such issuance of such common stock. (ii) if the corporation after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock issues derivative securities entitling persons to subscribe for or acquire shares of common stock, in each case at a new price per share for such common stock less than the conversion price in effect immediately preceding such issuance of derivative securities, then the conversion price shall be adjusted effective immediately following such issuance of derivative securities to a price equal to the new price per share; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made if such derivative securities are issued to holders of common stock and the corporation issues or distributes to each holder of series a preferred stock the derivative securities that each such holder would have been entitled to receive had the series a preferred stock held by such holder been converted prior to such issuance of derivative securities. rights or warrants issued by the corporation to all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase equity interests, which rights or warrants (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (b) are not exercisable and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock, in each case in clauses (a) through (c) until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a "trigger event"), shall for purposes of this subsection (c)(ii) not be deemed issued until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event. (iii) if (a) the exercise price provided for in any derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above, (b) the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above or (c) the rate at which any such derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock shall change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution upon an event which results in a related adjustment pursuant to this article viii), the conversion price then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted (effective only with respect to the conversion of series a preferred stock after such readjustment) to the conversion price that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance, sale, distribution or granting of such derivative securities been made based upon such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, but only with respect to such derivative securities as then remain outstanding. (d) special dividends. in case the corporation after the date of the original issuance of the series a preferred stock shall distribute to all holders of shares of common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding any regular periodic cash dividend but including any extraordinary cash dividend), equity interests (other than common stock) or rights to subscribe (excluding those referred to in subsection (c) above) for equity interests other than common stock, in each such case the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted to a price obtained by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be the closing price per share of common stock on such record date, less the then-current fair market value as of such record date (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment) of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness or equity interests or subscription rights so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and (y) the denominator shall be such closing price, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such record date; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made (1) if the corporation issues or distributes to each holder of series a preferred stock the subscription rights referred to above that each such holder would have been entitled to receive had the series a preferred stock held by such holder been converted prior to such record date or (2) if the corporation grants to each such holder the right to receive, upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock held by such holder at any time after the distribution of the evidences of indebtedness or assets or equity interests referred to above, the evidences of indebtedness or assets or equity interests that such holder would have been entitled to receive had such series a preferred stock been converted prior to such record date. the corporation shall provide any holder of series a preferred stock, upon receipt of a written request therefor, with any indenture or other instrument defining the rights of the holders of any indebtedness, assets, subscription rights or equity interests referred to in this subsection (d). rights or warrants issued by the corporation to all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase equity interests, which rights or warrants (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (ii) are not exercisable and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock, in each case in clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a trigger event, shall for purposes of this subsection (d) not be deemed issued until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event. (e) tender or exchange offer. in case a tender or exchange offer made by the corporation or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock shall be consummated and such tender offer shall involve an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment) at the last time (the "offer time") tenders may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) that, together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment), as of the offer time, of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the corporation or any such subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock consummated preceding the offer time and in respect of which no conversion price adjustment pursuant to this subsection (e) has been made, exceeds 5% of the product of the closing price of the common stock at the offer time multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the offer time, the conversion price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the offer time by a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be (i) the product of the closing price of the common stock at the offer time multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the offer time minus (ii) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the denominator shall be the product of (i) such closing price at the offer time multiplied by (ii) such number of outstanding shares at the offer time minus the number of purchased shares, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the offer time. for purposes of this subsection (e), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. (f) closing price determination. for the purpose of any computation under subsection (d) of this section b, the closing price of common stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices for the five consecutive trading days ending on the day in question (or if such day is not a trading day, the next preceding trading day), provided, however, that (i) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to this section b occurs on or after the 20th trading day prior to the day in question and prior to the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (ii) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to this section b occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and on or prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, and (iii) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is on or prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (ii) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the fair market value on the day in question (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any determination of such value for the purposes of subsection (d) of this section b) of the assets, evidences of indebtedness, equity interests or subscription rights being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for the purposes of any computation under subsection (e) of this section b, the closing price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the five consecutive trading days ending at the offer time; provided, however, that if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to this section b occurs on or after the date of commencement of such tender or exchange offer and prior to the offer time for such tender or exchange offer, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the conversion price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this subsection (f), the term "ex" date, (i) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (ii) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective, and (iii) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or such exchange or in such market after the offer time of such tender or exchange offer. (g) other adjustments. the corporation may, but shall not be required to, make such reductions in the conversion price, in addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section b, as it considers to be advisable, including without limitation in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of common stock or rights to purchase common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock, from any event treated as such for income tax purposes, from any subdivision, reclassification or combination of stock, from any issuance of rights or warrants or from any other transaction having an effect similar to any of the above. whenever the conversion price is reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, the corporation shall mail to the holders of then-outstanding shares of series a preferred stock a notice of the reduction at least 15 days prior to the date the reduced conversion price takes effect, and such notice shall state the reduced conversion price and the period it will be in effect. (h) minimum adjustment requirement. no adjustment shall be required unless such adjustment would result in an increase or decrease of at least $0.01 in the conversion price then subject to adjustment; provided, however, that any adjustments that are not made by reason of this subsection (h) shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. in case the corporation shall at any time issue shares of common stock by way of dividend on any stock of the corporation or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of common stock, said amount of $0.01 specified in the preceding sentence (as theretofore increased or decreased, if said amount shall have been adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (h)) shall forthwith be proportionately increased in the case of such a combination or decreased in the case of such a subdivision or stock dividend so as appropriately to reflect the same. (i) minimum permissible conversion price. notwithstanding any other provision of this section b, no adjustment to the conversion price shall reduce the conversion price below $0.01, and any such purported adjustment shall instead reduce the conversion price to $0.01. the corporation hereby covenants not to take any action that would or does result in any adjustment in the conversion price that, if made without giving effect to the previous sentence, would cause the conversion price to be less than $0.01. (j) notice. whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, a notice stating that the conversion price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted conversion price shall promptly be mailed by the corporation to the registered holders of the series a preferred stock. (k) no adjustment. anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no adjustment to the conversion price shall be made pursuant to this section b as a result of, or in connection with, the issuance of common stock or derivative securities (i) to directors or employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to an existing or future stock option, stock bonus, stock purchase or other similar plan adopted by the board of directors, an employment agreement approved by the board of directors, or the modification, renewal or extension of any such plan or agreement if approved by the board of directors or (ii) upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any derivative securities whether or not the issuance of which caused an adjustment hereunder. c. organic change. (a) corporation survives. upon the consummation of an organic change (other than a transaction in which the corporation is not the surviving entity), lawful provision shall be made as part of the terms of such transaction whereby the terms hereof shall be modified, without payment of any additional consideration by any holder, so as to provide that upon the conversion of shares of series a preferred stock following the consummation of such organic change, the holder of series a preferred stock shall have the right to acquire and receive (in lieu of or in addition to the shares of common stock acquirable and receivable prior to the organic change), without payment of additional consideration therefor, such securities, cash and other property as such holder would have received if such holder had converted such shares of series a preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to such organic change. lawful provision also shall be made as part of the terms of the organic change so that all other terms hereof shall remain in full force and effect following such an organic change. the provisions of this subsection (a) shall similarly apply to successive organic changes of the character described in this subsection (a).

business on such record date and (y) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares of common stock outstanding and the total number of shares of common stock constituting such dividend or distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such record date. for purposes of this subsection (a), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. the corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the corporation.

(c) issuances below exercise price. (i) if the corporation after the date hereof issues common stock without consideration or at a price per share (such no consideration or price per share, the "new price per share") less than the exercise price in effect immediately preceding such issuance of common stock, then the exercise price shall be adjusted effective immediately following such issuance of common stock to the new price per share; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made if such common stock is issued to holders of common stock and the corporation issues or distributes to each warrantholder the common stock that each such warrantholder would have been entitled to receive had the warrants held by such warrantholder been converted prior to such issuance of such common stock. (ii) if the corporation after the date hereof issues derivative securities entitling persons to subscribe for or acquire shares of common stock, in each case at a new price per share for such common stock less than the exercise price in effect immediately preceding such issuance of derivative securities, then the exercise price shall be adjusted effective immediately following such issuance of derivative securities to a price equal to the new price per share; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made if such derivative securities are issued to holders of common stock and the corporation issues or distributes to each warrantholder the derivative securities that each such warrantholder would have been entitled to receive had the warrants held by such warrantholder been converted prior to such issuance of derivative securities. rights or warrants issued by the corporation to all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase equity interests, which rights or warrants (a) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (b) are not exercisable and (c) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, including shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants evidenced by this warrant certificate, in each case in clauses (a) through (c) until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a "trigger event"), shall for purposes of this subsection (c)(ii) not be deemed issued until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event. (iii) if (a) the exercise price provided for in any derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above, (b) the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above or (c) the rate at which any such derivative securities referred to in subsection (c)(ii) above are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock shall change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution upon an event which results in a related adjustment pursuant to this article viii), the exercise price then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted (effective only with respect to the exercise of warrants after such readjustment) to the exercise price that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance, sale, distribution or granting of such derivative securities been made based upon such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, but only with respect to such derivative securities as then remain outstanding. (d) special dividends. in case the corporation after the date hereof shall distribute to all holders of shares of common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding any regular periodic cash dividend but including any extraordinary cash dividend), equity interests (other than common stock) or rights to subscribe (excluding those referred to in subsection (c) above) for equity interests other than common stock, in each such case the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted to a price obtained by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be the closing price per share of common stock on such record date, less the then-current fair market value as of such record date (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment) of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness or equity interests or subscription rights so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and (y) the denominator shall be such closing price, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such record date; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made (1) if the corporation issues or distributes to each warrantholder the subscription rights referred to above that each warrantholder would have been entitled to receive had the warrants held by such warrantholder been exercised prior to such record date or (2) if the corporation grants to each warrantholder the right to receive, upon the exercise of the warrants held by such warrantholder at any time after the distribution of the evidences of indebtedness or assets or equity interests referred to above, the evidences of indebtedness or assets or equity interests that such warrantholder would have been entitled to receive had such warrants been exercised prior to such record date. the corporation shall provide any warrantholder, upon receipt of a written request therefor, with any indenture or other instrument defining the rights of the holders of any indebtedness, assets, subscription rights or equity interests referred to in this subsection (d). rights or warrants issued by the corporation to all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase equity interests, which rights or warrants (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock, (ii) are not exercisable and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, including shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants evidenced by this warrant certificate, in each case in clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a trigger event, shall for purposes of this subsection (d) not be deemed issued until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event. (e) tender or exchange offer. in case a tender or exchange offer made by the corporation or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock shall be consummated and such tender offer shall involve an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment) at the last time (the "offer time") tenders may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) that, together with the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors in its good faith judgment), as of the offer time, of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the corporation or any such subsidiary for all or any portion of the common stock consummated preceding the offer time and in respect of which no exercise price adjustment pursuant to this subsection (e) has been made, exceeds 5% of the product of the closing price of the common stock at the offer time multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the offer time, the exercise price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the offer time by a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be (i) the product of the closing price of the common stock at the offer time multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the offer time minus (ii) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "purchased shares") and (y) the denominator shall be the product of (i) such closing price at the offer time multiplied by (ii) such number of outstanding shares at the offer time minus the number of purchased shares, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the offer time. for purposes of this subsection (e), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of common stock. (f) closing price determination. for the purpose of any computation under subsection (d) of this section 9.1, the closing price of common stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices for the five consecutive trading days ending on the day in question (or if such day is not a trading day, the next preceding trading day), provided, however, that (i) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to this section 9 occurs on or after the 20th trading day prior to the day in question and prior to the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (ii) if the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to this section 9 occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and on or prior to the day in question, the closing price for each trading day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, and (iii) if the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is on or prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (ii) of this proviso, the closing price for each trading day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the fair market value on the day in question (as determined by the board of directors in a manner consistent with any determination of such value for the purposes of subsection (d) of this section 9.1) of the assets, evidences of indebtedness, equity interests or subscription rights being distributed applicable to one share of common stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. for the purposes of any computation under subsection (e) of this section 9.1, the closing price on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the five consecutive trading days ending at the offer time; provided, however, that if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to this section 9 occurs on or after the date of commencement of such tender or exchange offer and prior to the offer time for the tender or exchange offer, the closing price for each trading day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such closing price by the same fraction by which the exercise price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. for purposes of this subsection (f), the term "ex" date, (i) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the closing price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (ii) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of common stock, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective, and (iii) when used with respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nyse or such exchange or in such market after the offer time of such tender or exchange offer. (g) other adjustments. the corporation may, but shall not be required to, make such reductions in the exercise price, in addition to those required by subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section 9.1, as it considers to be advisable, including without limitation in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of common stock or rights to purchase common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock, from any event treated as such for income tax purposes, from any subdivision, reclassification or combination of stock, from any issuance of rights or warrants or from any other transaction having an effect similar to any of the above. whenever the exercise price is reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, the corporation shall cause to be filed with the warrant agent and shall cause to be mailed to the warrantholders, at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the warrant register, a notice of the reduction at least 15 days prior to the date the reduced exercise price takes effect, and such notice shall state the reduced exercise price and the period it will be in effect. (h) minimum adjustment requirement. no adjustment shall be required unless such adjustment would result in an increase or decrease of at least $0.01 in the exercise price then subject to adjustment; provided, however, that any adjustments that are not made by reason of this subsection (h) shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. in case the corporation shall at any time issue shares of common stock by way of dividend on any stock of the corporation or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of common stock, said amount of $0.01 specified in the preceding sentence (as theretofore increased or decreased, if said amount shall have been adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (h)) shall forthwith be proportionately increased in the case of such a combination or decreased in the case of such a subdivision or stock dividend so as appropriately to reflect the same. (i) minimum permissible exercise price. notwithstanding any other provision of this section b, no adjustment to the exercise price shall reduce the exercise price below $0.01, and any such purported adjustment shall instead reduce the exercise price to $0.01. the corporation hereby covenants not to take any action that would or does result in any adjustment in the exercise price that, if made without giving effect to the previous sentence, would cause the exercise price to be less than $0.01. (j) certificate. whenever an adjustment in the exercise price is made as required or permitted by the provisions of this section 9.1, the corporation shall promptly file with the warrant agent a certificate of its chief financial officer setting forth (a) the adjusted exercise price as provided in this section 9.1 and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and the computation thereof and (b) the number of shares of common stock (or portions thereof) purchasable upon exercise of a warrant after such adjustment in the exercise price in accordance with section 9.2 hereof and the record date therefor, and promptly after such filing shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of such adjustment to each warrantholder at his or her last address as the same appears on the warrant register. such certificate, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive and final evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. the warrant agent shall be entitled to rely upon such certificate, and shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any warrantholder desiring inspection thereof.

(l) no adjustment. anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no adjustment to the exercise price or the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant shall be made pursuant to this section 9.1 or section 9.2 as a result of, or in connection with, the issuance of common stock or derivative securities (i) issued to directors or employees of the corporation or its subsidiaries pursuant to an existing or future stock option, stock bonus, stock purchase or other similar plan adopted by the board of directors, an employment agreement approved by the board of directors, or the modification, renewal or extension of any such plan or agreement if approved by the board of directors or (ii) upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any derivative securities whether or not the issuance of which caused an adjustment hereunder. 9.2. adjustment to number of warrant shares. upon each adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to section 9.1 hereof the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such adjustment shall be adjusted to the number, calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a warrant share, obtained by (x) multiplying the number of warrant shares purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment upon the exercise of a warrant by the exercise price in effect prior to such adjustment and (y) dividing the product so obtained by the exercise price in effect after such adjustment of the exercise price. 9.3. organic change.

the warrantholders, with terms that provide that upon the exercise of such new securities, the holder of such new securities shall have the right to purchase (in lieu of or in addition to the warrant

number of warrant shares into which such holder's warrants might have been exercised immediately prior to such organic change. the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document of the surviving entity shall provide for such adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document,

stated in this warrant certificate. 9.5. certain events. if any event similar to or of the type contemplated by the provisions of section 9.1 or 9.3, but not expressly provided for by such provisions, occurs, then the board of directors of the corporation will make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the exercise price and the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant so as to protect the rights of the warrantholders in a manner determined in the good faith judgment of the board of directors to be substantially similar to the mechanisms provided herein; provided,

such default within the time period specified under part (d). a notice given pursuant to clause (i) of the foregoing sentence must be given in writing and must specify the default, demand that it be

(b) the trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. a delay or omission by the trustee or any holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an event of default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the event of default. no remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. all available remedies are cumulative. section 7.04. waiver of past defaults. the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes by notice to the trustee may waive on behalf of the holders of all of the notes an existing default and its consequences except (a) a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a note, (b) a default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any note when required pursuant to the terms of this indenture or (c) a default in respect of a provision that under section 10.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each holder affected. when a default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any consequent right. section 7.05. control by majority. the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee. however, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this indenture or, subject to section 8.01, that the trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of other holders or would involve the trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. prior to taking any action hereunder, the trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. section 7.06. limitation on suits.

(c) after an amendment under this section 10.02 becomes effective, the issuer shall mail to holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. the failure to give such notice to all holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this section 10.02. section 10.03. compliance with trust indenture act. every amendment to this indenture or the notes shall comply with the tia as then in effect. section 10.04. revocation and effect of consents and waivers. (a) a consent to an amendment or a waiver by a holder of a note shall bind the holder and every subsequent holder of that note or portion of the note that evidences the same debt as the consenting holder's note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the note. however, any such holder or subsequent holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such holder's note or portion of the note if the trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date on which the trustee receives an officers' certificate from the issuer certifying that the requisite number of consents have been received. after an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every holder. an amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the (i) receipt by the issuer or the trustee of the requisite number of consents, (ii) satisfaction of conditions to effectiveness as set forth in this indenture and any indenture supplemental hereto containing such amendment or waiver and (iii) execution of such amendment or waiver (or supplemental indenture) by the issuer and the trustee. (b) the issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this indenture. if a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those persons who were holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such persons continue to be holders after such record date. no such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date. section 10.05. notation on or exchange of notes. if an amendment changes the terms of a note, the trustee may require the holder of the note to deliver it to the trustee. the trustee may place an appropriate notation on the note regarding the changed terms and return it to the holder. alternatively, if the issuer or the trustee so determines, the issuer in exchange for the note shall issue and, upon issuer order, the trustee shall authenticate a new note that reflects the changed terms. failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new note shall not affect the validity of such amendment. section 10.06. trustee to sign amendments. the trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this article 10 if the amendment does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the trustee. if it does, the trustee may but need not sign it. in signing such amendment the trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to section 8.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this indenture and that such amendment is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the issuer enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions hereof (including section 10.03). section 10.07. payment for consent. neither the issuer nor any affiliate of the issuer shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this indenture or the notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. article 11 security; note guarantees section 11.01. collateral and guarantee requirement. prior to the issuance of the notes on the issue date, and for so long as any note remains outstanding, the issuer shall execute, and cause its domestic subsidiaries to execute, the security documents and shall take any other steps necessary to cause the collateral and guarantee requirement to be satisfied. section 11.02. regarding the collateral agent. (a) the trustee, on behalf of the secured parties, hereby appoints citicorp usa, inc. to act as collateral agent under this indenture and the security documents, provided however that for so long as any revolver obligations are outstanding, the same person shall act as collateral agent under both the security documents and the revolving loan documentation. the trustee on behalf of itself and the secured parties hereby irrevocably appoints the collateral agent as its agent and authorizes the collateral agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the collateral agent by the terms hereof and of the security documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. (b) the person serving as collateral agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the issuer or any subsidiary or other affiliate thereof as if it were not the collateral agent hereunder and may accept fees and other consideration from the issuer for services in connection with this indenture, the security documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the trustee or the holders. (c) the collateral agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in this indenture and the security documents. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the collateral agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the collateral agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by this indenture and the security documents that the collateral agent is required to exercise in writing by the trustee or such number or percentage of the holders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in article 10, and (iii) except as expressly set forth in this indenture and the security documents, the collateral agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the issuer or any of the subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as collateral agent or any of its affiliates in any capacity. the collateral agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the trustee or such number or percentage of the holders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in article 10 or otherwise in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. the collateral agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the collateral agent by the issuer or the trustee, and the collateral agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this indenture or any security document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in this indenture or any security document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this indenture or any security document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the validity, perfection, or priority of any lien created by any of the security documents, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in this indenture or any security document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the collateral agent. (d) the collateral agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper person. the collateral agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. the collateral agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the issuer), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. (e) the collateral agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents or attorneys-in-fact appointed by the collateral agent. the collateral agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective related parties. the exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact and to the related parties of the collateral agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact. (f) subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor collateral agent as provided in this paragraph, the collateral agent may resign at any time by notifying the trustee and the issuer and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes. upon any such resignation, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes shall have the right, in consultation with the issuer, to appoint a successor. if no successor shall have been so appointed by such holders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring collateral agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring collateral agent may, on behalf of the trustee and the holders, appoint a successor collateral agent that shall have an office in new york, new york. upon the acceptance of its appointment as collateral agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring collateral agent, and the retiring collateral agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the security documents. the fees payable by the issuer to a successor collateral agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the issuer and such successor. after the collateral agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this article shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring collateral agent, its sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact and their respective related parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as collateral agent. notwithstanding the foregoing, any successor collateral agent must meet the requirements of section 11.02(a). (g) except for action expressly required of the collateral agent by this indenture and the security documents, the collateral agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from the holders of their indemnification obligations under section 11.02(i) in respect of such action. without limiting the foregoing, the collateral agent shall not be required to, and shall not, take any action to enforce any of its or the trustee's or holders' rights under, nor waive or amend any provision of, this indenture or any security document or any collateral, nor give any notice or make any request or demand or filing thereunder, except in each instance as and to the extent instructed to do so by the trustee or such number or percentage of the holders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in article 10, and the collateral agent shall have no liability for failure to take any action in the absence of such instructions, provided that the collateral agent will promptly send to the trustee a copy of each notice, request or other document delivered to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of this indenture and the security documents and will take such actions contemplated by this indenture and the security documents as the trustee and such number or percentage of the holders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in article 10 may reasonably instruct, except that nothing herein or in any security document shall require the collateral agent to take any action that in the reasonable opinion of the collateral agent would be contrary to the terms of this indenture or any security document or applicable law or subject the collateral agent to personal liability. (h) the issuer shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the collateral agent and its affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of milbank, tweed, hadley & mccloy llp, special new york counsel for the collateral agent, in connection with the preparation of this indenture and the security documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the collateral agent, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the collateral agent in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this indenture and the security documents, including its rights under this article. (i) the issuer shall indemnify the collateral agent and each related party of the collateral agent (each such person being called an "indemnitee") against, and hold each indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this indenture, the notes and any security document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to such documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds from the sale of any note, (iii) any presence, release or threatened release of hazardous materials on, at, under or from any mortgaged property or any other property currently or formerly owned or operated by the issuer or any of the subsidiaries, or any environmental liability related in any way to the issuer or any of the subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee or any related person of such indemnitee as determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. (j) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the issuer shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this indenture, the security documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. article 12 subordination section 12.01. agreement to subordinate. the issuer agrees, and each holder by accepting a note agrees, that the indebtedness evidenced by the notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this article 12, to the prior payment in full of the revolver obligations and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the lenders under the revolver obligations. the notes shall in all respects rank senior to all existing and future indebtedness of the issuer other than the revolver obligations; and only indebtedness in relation to the revolver obligations shall rank senior to the notes in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. all provisions of this article 12 shall be subject to section 12.12. section 12.02. liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy. upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the issuer to its creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the issuer or its property: (a) lenders under the revolver obligations shall be entitled to receive payment in full of such revolver obligations before holders shall be entitled to receive any payment of principal of or interest on the notes; and (b) until the revolver obligations are paid in full, any payment or distribution to which holders would be entitled but for this article 12 shall be made to lenders under such revolver obligations as their interests may appear, except that holders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such revolver obligations to at least the same extent as the notes. section 12.03. default on revolver obligations. (a) the issuer may not pay the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on the notes, make any deposit pursuant to section 9.01 or otherwise repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire any notes (collectively, "pay the notes") if (i) any amount under the revolver obligations is not paid when due or (ii) any other default on such revolver obligations occurs and the maturity of such revolver obligations is accelerated in accordance with the relevant terms of the revolving loan documentation unless, in either case, (a) the default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or (b) such revolver obligations have been paid in full; provided, however, that the issuer may pay the notes without regard to the foregoing if the issuer and the trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the representative of such creditors with respect to which either of the events set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence has occurred and is continuing. (b) during the continuance of any default (other than a default described in clause (i) or (ii) of part (a) of this section 12.03) with respect to any revolver obligations pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the issuer may not pay the notes for a period (a "payment blockage period") commencing upon the receipt by the trustee (with a copy to the issuer) of written notice (a "blockage notice") of such default from the representative of such revolver obligations specifying an election to effect a payment blockage period and ending 179 days thereafter (or earlier if such payment blockage period is terminated (i) by written notice to the trustee and the issuer from such representative, (ii) by repayment in full of such revolver obligations or (iii) because no default with respect to any revolver obligations is continuing). notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding sentence (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of part (a) of this section 12.03), the issuer may resume payments on the notes after the end of such payment blockage period, unless the lenders under such revolver obligations or the representative of such lenders shall have accelerated the maturity of such revolver obligations, and such revolver obligations have not been repaid in full. (c) not more than one blockage notice may be given in any period of 360 consecutive days, irrespective of the number of defaults during such period. for purposes of this section 12.03, no default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any payment blockage period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent payment blockage period, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days. section 12.04. acceleration of payment of notes. if payment of the notes is accelerated because of an event of default, the trustee (provided, that the trustee shall have received written notice from the issuer or a representative identifying the revolver obligations for which such representative is so designated, on which notice the trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively) shall promptly notify the lenders under the relevant revolver obligations (or their representative) of the acceleration. if any such revolver obligation is outstanding, the issuer may not pay the notes until five business days after such creditors or their representative receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay the notes only if this article 12 otherwise permits payment at that time. section 12.05. when distribution must be paid over. if a payment or distribution is made to holders that because of this article 12 should not have been made to them, any holder who receive such a payment or distribution shall hold it in trust for lenders under the relevant revolver obligations and pay it over to such lenders as their interests may appear. section 12.06. subrogation. after all revolver obligations are paid in full and for so long as any note remains outstanding, holders shall be subrogated to the rights of lenders under the revolver obligations to receive distributions applicable to revolver obligations. a distribution made under this article 12 to holders of such revolver obligations which otherwise would have been made to holders is not, as between the issuer and holders, a payment by the issuer on such revolver obligations. section 12.07. relative rights. this article 12 defines the relative rights of holders and lenders under such revolver obligations. nothing in this indenture shall: (a) impair, as between the issuer and holders, the obligation of the issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the notes in accordance with their terms; or (b) prevent the trustee or any holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default, subject to the rights of lenders under revolver obligations to receive distributions otherwise payable to holders. section 12.08. subordination may not be impaired by issuer. no right of any lender under the revolver obligations to enforce the subordination of the indebtedness evidenced by the notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the issuer or by its failure to comply with this indenture. section 12.09. rights of trustee and paying agent. notwithstanding section 12.03, the trustee or paying agent may continue to make payments on the notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two business days prior to the date of such payment, a trust officer of the trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that payments may not be made under this article 12. the issuer, the registrar, the paying agent, a representative or a lender under revolver obligations may give such notice; provided, however, that, if a lender under revolver obligations has a representative, only the representative may give such notice. the trustee in its individual or any other capacity may be a lender under revolver obligations with the same rights it would have if it were not trustee. the registrar, the paying agent and the collateral agent may do the same with like rights. the trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this article 12 with respect to any lender under revolver obligations which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other lender under such revolver obligations; and nothing in article 8 shall deprive the trustee of any of its rights as such holder. nothing in this article 12 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the trustee under or pursuant to section 8.07 or any other section of this indenture. section 12.10. distribution or notice to representative. whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to a lender under revolver obligations, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their representative (if any). section 12.11. article 12 not to prevent events of default or limit right to accelerate. the failure to make a payment pursuant to the notes by reason of any provision in this article 12 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a default. nothing in this article 12 shall have any effect on the right of the holders or the trustee to accelerate the maturity of the notes. section 12.12. trust monies not subordinated. notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of u.s. government obligations held in trust under article 9 by the trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any revolver obligation or subject to the restrictions set forth in this article 12, and none of the holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the issuer or any lender under the revolver obligations or any other creditor of the issuer. section 12.13. trustee entitled to rely. upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this article 12, the trustee and the holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in section 12.02 are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making such payment or distribution to the trustee or to the holders or (c) upon the representatives for the lenders under revolver obligations for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the lenders under revolver obligations and other indebtedness of the issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this article 12. in the event that the trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a lender under revolver obligations to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this article 12, the trustee may request such person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the trustee as to the amount of such revolver obligations owed to such person, the extent to which such person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such person under this article 12, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the trustee may defer any payment to such person pending judicial determination as to the right of such person to receive such payment. the provisions of sections 8.01 and 8.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the trustee pursuant to this article 12. section 12.14. trustee to effectuate subordination. each holder by accepting a note authorizes and directs the trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the holders and the lenders under revolver obligations as provided in this article 12 and appoints the trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. section 12.15. trustee not fiduciary for lenders under revolver obligations. the trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the lenders under revolver obligations and shall not be liable to any such creditors if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to holders or the issuer or any other person, money or assets to which lenders under revolver obligations shall be entitled by virtue of this article 12 or otherwise. section 12.16. reliance by holders of senior indebtedness on subordination provisions. each holder by accepting a note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to any lender under revolver obligations, whether the indebtedness under such revolver obligation was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the notes, to extend and continue to extend, or to continue to extend, such revolver obligations and such lender under revolver obligations shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in extending and continuing to extend, or in continuing to extend, such revolver obligations. article 13 miscellaneous section 13.01. trust indenture act controls. if and to the extent that any provision of this indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by, or with another provision (an "incorporated provision") included in this indenture by operation of, tia ss.ss. 310 to 318, inclusive, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control. section 13.02. notices. any notice or

shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other holders. if a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. section 13.03. communication by holders with other holders. holders may communicate pursuant to tia ss. 312(b) with other holders with respect to their rights under this indenture or the notes. the issuer, the trustee, the registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of tia ss. 312(c). section 13.04. certificate and opinion as to conditions precedent. upon any request or application by the issuer to the trustee to take or refrain from taking any action under this indenture (other than a request to authenticate the notes in accordance with this indenture), the issuer shall furnish to the trustee: (a) an officers' certificate stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with; and (b) an opinion of counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with. section 13.05. statements required in certificate or opinion.

notes disregarded. in determining whether the holders of the required principal amount of notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, notes owned by the issuer or any pledgor and guarantor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only notes which a trust officer of the trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. subject to the foregoing, only notes outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination. notwithstanding the foregoing, notes that are to be acquired by the issuer or any pledgor and guarantor pursuant to an exchange offer, tender offer or other agreement shall not be deemed to be owned by such entity until legal title to such notes passes to such entity. section 13.07. rules by trustee, paying agent and registrar. the trustee may make reasonable rules for action

default, subject to applicable regulatory and legal requirements, the collateral agent may sell the collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any pledgor and guarantor, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the pledgors and guarantors hereby waive all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal any pledgor and guarantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give a pledgor and guarantor 10 days' prior written notice (which each pledgor and guarantor agrees is a "reasonable authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of section 9-611 of the ucc (as defined in the security agreement) of the collateral agent's intention to make any sale of such pledgor and guarantor's collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid in full by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this section 6, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free from any right of redemption, stay or appraisal on the part of any pledgor and guarantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any indenture obligation then due and payable to it from such pledgor and guarantor as a credit against the purchase price, and it may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such pledgor and guarantor therefor. for purposes hereof, (a) a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof, (b) the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and (c) such pledgor and guarantor shall not be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the indenture obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the collateral and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. section 7. subordination. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this pledge agreement, all rights and remedies set forth in this pledge agreement shall be subject to the subordination provisions set forth in article 12 of the indenture and article ii of the guarantee agreement. section 8. application of proceeds of sale. the collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral, as well as any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of any revolver obligations oustanding, to the extent the revolving loan documentation is in force; second, to the payment of all costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the trustee or the collateral agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other transaction document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this agreement or any of the indenture obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the collateral agent hereunder or under any other transaction document on behalf of any pledgor and guarantor, and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other transaction document; third, to the payment in full of the indenture obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the indenture obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and fourth, to the pledgors and guarantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the collateral agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of the collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section 9. reimbursement of collateral agent. (a) each pledgor and guarantor agrees to pay upon demand to the collateral agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, other charges and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts or agents, that the collateral agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the collateral agent hereunder or (iv) the failure by such pledgor and guarantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. (b) without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other transaction documents, each pledgor and guarantor agrees to indemnify the collateral agent and the indemnified parties (as defined in section 10.04 of the restructuring agreement) against, and hold each indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, other charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this agreement or any other transaction document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee. (c) any amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional indenture obligations secured hereby and by the other security documents. the provisions of this section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the indenture obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this agreement or any other transaction document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the collateral agent or any other secured party. all amounts due under this section 9 shall be payable on written demand therefor and shall bear interest at the rate specified in section 1 of the notes. section 10. collateral agent appointed attorney-in-fact. each pledgor and guarantor hereby appoints the collateral agent the attorney-in-fact of such pledgor and guarantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the collateral agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the collateral agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, with full power of substitution either in the collateral agent's name or in the name of such pledgor and guarantor, to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of any collateral, to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other instruments for the payment of money payable to the pledgor and guarantor representing any interest or dividend or other distribution payable in respect of the collateral or any part thereof or on account thereof and to give full discharge for the same, to settle, compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim or proceeding with respect thereto, and to sell, assign, endorse, pledge, transfer and to make any agreement respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the collateral agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the collateral agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. the collateral agent and the other secured parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any pledgor and guarantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. section 11. waivers; amendment. (a) no failure or delay of the collateral agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. the rights and remedies of the collateral agent hereunder and of the other secured parties under the other transaction documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. no waiver of any provisions of this agreement or consent to any departure by any pledgor and guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. no notice or demand on any pledgor and guarantor in any case shall entitle such pledgor and guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) neither this agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the collateral agent and the pledgor and guarantor or pledgors and guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with article 10 of the indenture. section 12. securities act, etc. in view of the position of the pledgors and guarantors in relation to the pledged securities, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "federal securities laws") with respect to any disposition of the pledged securities permitted hereunder. each pledgor and guarantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged securities could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged securities under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each pledgor and guarantor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of the pledged securities, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged securities for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each pledgor and guarantor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale, in either case in accordance with a valid exemption from registration under the federal securities laws. each pledgor and guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged securities at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. the provisions of this section 12 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. section 13. registration, etc. each pledgor and guarantor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, if for any reason the collateral agent desires to sell any of the pledged securities at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the collateral agent, use its reasonable best efforts to take or to cause the issuer of such pledged securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the collateral agent to permit the public sale of such pledged securities. each pledgor and guarantor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the collateral agent, each other secured party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, affiliates and controlling persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses to the collateral agent of legal counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such pledgor and guarantor or the issuer of such pledged securities by the collateral agent or any other secured party expressly for use therein. each pledgor and guarantor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its reasonable best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the issuer of such pledged securities to qualify, file or register, any of the pledged securities under the blue sky or other securities laws of such states as may be requested by the collateral agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. each pledgor and guarantor will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this section 13. each pledgor and guarantor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it to comply with the provisions of this section 13 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements contained in this section 13 may be specifically enforced. section 14. security interest absolute. all rights of the collateral agent hereunder, the grant of a security interest in the collateral and all obligations of each pledgor and guarantor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the indenture, any other transaction document, any agreement with respect to any of the indenture obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the indenture obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the indenture, any other transaction document or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to or departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the indenture obligations or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any pledgor and guarantor in respect of the indenture obligations or in respect of this agreement (other than the indefeasible payment in full of all the indenture obligations). section 15. termination or release. (a) this agreement and the security interests granted hereby shall terminate when all the indenture obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and there are no notes outstanding. (b) upon any sale or other transfer by any pledgor and guarantor of any collateral that is permitted under the indenture to any person that is not a pledgor and guarantor, or, upon the effectiveness of a release of the security interest granted hereby in any collateral pursuant to section 18, the security interest in such collateral shall be automatically released. (c) in connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) or section 18, the collateral agent shall execute and deliver to any pledgor and guarantor, at such pledgor and guarantor's expense, all documents that such pledgor and guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this section 15 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the collateral agent. section 16. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in section 13.02 of the indenture. all communications and notices hereunder to any pledgor and guarantor shall be given to it at the address or telecopy number set forth on schedule i, with a copy to the issuer. section 17. further assurances. each pledgor and guarantor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the collateral agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this agreement or with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the collateral agent its rights and remedies hereunder. section 18. binding effect; several agreement; assignments. whenever in this agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any pledgor and guarantor that are contained in this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns. this agreement shall become effective as to any pledgor and guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such pledgor and guarantor shall have been delivered to the collateral agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the collateral agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such pledgor and guarantor, and the collateral agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such pledgor and guarantor, the collateral agent and the other secured parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no pledgor and guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein or in the collateral (and any such attempted assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this agreement or the other transaction documents. in the event that a pledgor and guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary pursuant to a transaction permitted under the transaction documents, such pledgor and guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this agreement without further action. this agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each pledgor and guarantor, and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any pledgor and guarantor without the approval of any other pledgor and guarantor, and without affecting the obligations of any other pledgor and guarantor hereunder. section 19. survival of agreement; severability. (a) all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by each pledgor and guarantor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement or any other transaction document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the collateral agent and the other secured parties and shall survive the issuance and delivery to the holders of the notes, regardless of any investigation made by the secured parties or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any indenture obligation remains unpaid and for so long as any notes are outstanding. (b) in the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). the parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. section 20. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york. section 21. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in section 18. delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this agreement. section 22. rules of interpretation. the rules of construction specified in section 1.03 of the indenture shall be applicable to this agreement. section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this agreement. section 23. jurisdiction; consent to service of process. (a) each pledgor and guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any new york state court or federal court of the united states of america sitting in new york city, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other transaction documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such new york state or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. nothing in this agreement shall affect any right that the collateral agent or any other secured party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this agreement or the other transaction documents against any pledgor and guarantor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (b) each pledgor and guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other transaction documents in any new york state or federal court. each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (c) each party to this agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in section 16. nothing in this agreement will affect the right of any party to this agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. section 24. waiver of jury trial. each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this agreement. each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this section. section 25. limitation on security interest. anything contained in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation hereunder secured by each pledgor and guarantor shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greatest amount that would not render such pledgor and guarantor's secured obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under section 548 of title 11 of the united states code or any provisions of applicable state law (collectively, the "fraudulent transfer laws"), in each case after giving effect to all liabilities of such pledgor and guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that would be taken into account in determining whether the incurrence of the obligation would constitute a fraudulent conveyance under the fraudulent transfer laws and after giving effect, both in determining such pledgor and guarantor's probable debt hereunder and in determining its assets, to the existence of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such pledgor and guarantor pursuant to (a) applicable law or (b) any agreement, including the indemnity, subrogation and contribution agreement. section 26. additional pledgors and guarantors. pursuant to section 5.11 of the indenture, each subsidiary that was not in existence or not a domestic subsidiary on the date of the indenture is required to enter into this agreement as a pledgor and guarantor upon becoming a domestic subsidiary. upon execution and delivery by the collateral agent and a subsidiary of an instrument in the form of annex 1, such subsidiary shall become a pledgor and guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a pledgor and guarantor herein. the execution and delivery of such instrument shall not require the consent of any pledgor and guarantor hereunder. the rights and obligations of each pledgor and guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new pledgor and guarantor as a party to this agreement. in witness whereof, the parties hereto have duly executed this agreement as of the day and year first above written. memc electronic materials, inc. by: /s/

otherwise, for the use and benefit of the collateral agent and the secured parties, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the collateral; (c) to sign the name of any grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the collateral; (d) to send verifications of

realize on all or any of the collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any collateral; (f) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the collateral; (g) to notify, or to require any grantor to notify, account debtors to make payment directly to the collateral agent; and (h) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this agreement, as fully and completely as though the collateral agent were the absolute owner of the collateral for all purposes; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the collateral agent or any secured party to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the collateral agent or any secured party, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby, and no action taken or omitted to be taken by the collateral agent or any secured party with respect to the collateral or any part thereof shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor of any grantor or to any claim or action against the collateral agent or any secured party. it is understood and agreed that the appointment of the collateral agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. the provisions of this section shall in no event relieve any grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other transaction document with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or impose any obligation on the collateral agent or any secured party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the collateral agent or any secured party of any other or further right which it may have on the date of this agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other transaction document, by law or otherwise. article vi remedies -------- section 6.01. subordination. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this security agreement, all rights and remedies set forth in this security agreement shall be subject to the subordination provisions set forth in article 12 of the indenture and article ii of the guarantee agreement. section 6.02. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, each grantor agrees to deliver each item of collateral to the collateral agent on demand, and it is agreed that the collateral agent shall have the right to take any or all of the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any collateral consisting of intellectual property, on demand, to cause the security interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such collateral by the applicable grantors to the collateral agent (except to the extent assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would result in a loss of said intellectual property), or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, any such collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the collateral agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the ucc or other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor agrees that the collateral agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor, and each grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give the grantors 10 days' written notice (which each grantor agrees is a "reasonable authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of section 9-611 of the ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the collateral agent's intention to make any sale of collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this section, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any indenture obligation then due and payable to such secured party from any grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such secured party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. for purposes hereof a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the indenture obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this agreement and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. section 6.03. application of proceeds. the collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral, as well as any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of any revolver obligations outstanding, to the extent the revolving loan documentation is in force; second, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the trustee or the collateral agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other transaction document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this agreement or any of the obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the collateral agent hereunder or under any other transaction document on behalf of any grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other transaction document; third, to the payment in full of the indenture obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the indenture obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and fourth, to the grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the collateral agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of the collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section 6.04. grant of license to use intellectual property. for the purpose of enabling the collateral agent to exercise rights and remedies under this article at such time as the collateral agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors) to use, license or sub-license any of the collateral consisting of intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. the use of such license by the collateral agent shall be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided that any license, sub-license or other transaction entered into by the collateral agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default. article vii

instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the indenture obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the indenture, any other transaction document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the indenture obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any grantor in respect of the indenture obligations or this agreement. section 7.03. survival of agreement. all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by any grantor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the secured parties and shall survive the issuance of the notes and their purchase by the holders, regardless of any investigation made by the holders or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect until this agreement shall terminate. section 7.04. binding effect; several agreement. this agreement shall become effective as to any grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such grantor shall have been delivered to the collateral agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the collateral agent, and

collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by this agreement or the other transaction documents. this agreement shall be construed as a separate

(b) piggyback registrations. if the company parties propose to register any of their securities under the securities act as contemplated by section 2.3 and such securities are to be distributed in an underwritten offering through one or more underwriters, the company parties will, if requested by any holder of registrable securities pursuant to section 2.3 and subject to the provisions of section 2.3(b), use their best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include on the same terms and conditions that apply to the other sellers in such registration all the registrable securities to be offered and sold by such holder among the securities of the company parties to be distributed by such underwriters in such registration. the holders of registrable securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the company parties and such underwriters and any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company parties to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such holders of registrable securities and any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement also shall be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders of registrable securities. any such holder of registrable securities shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company parties or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's registrable securities and such holder's intended method of distribution or any other representations required by law. (c) participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 2.7. no inconsistent agreements; additional rights. each of the company parties represents and warrants that, except for the existing registration rights agreement, it is not a party to any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities by this agreement and, other than the registration rights granted as provided herein, has not granted to any party rights with respect to the registration of any registrable securities or any other securities issued or to be issued by it. each of the company and the investor agrees that, immediately upon the assignment to and assumption by the investor of the existing registration rights agreement pursuant to an agreement among the investor, veba zweite verwaltungsgesellschaft mbh and e.on north america, inc., the existing registration rights agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. the company parties shall not grant to any other holder of its securities piggyback registration rights that would reduce the number of registrable securities in any registration under this agreement without the prior written consent of holders of 75% of the registrable securities to be included in such registration. 2.8. registration expenses. all expenses incident to the company parties' performance of or compliance with this agreement will be paid by the company parties, including (i) all registration and filing fees, and any other fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made with the sec or the nasd, (ii) all fees and expenses in connection with compliance with state securities or "blue sky" laws, (iii) all printing, duplicating, word processing, messenger, telephone, facsimile and delivery expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for the registrable securities in a form eligible for deposit with the depository trust company and of printing prospectuses), (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for the company parties and of all independent certified public accountants of the company parties(including the expenses of any special audit and cold comfort letters required by or incident to such performance), (v) securities act liability insurance or similar insurance if the company parties so desire or the underwriters so require in accordance with then-customary underwriting practice, (vi) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the registrable securities on any securities exchange or quotation of the registrable securities on any inter-dealer quotation system, (vii) all applicable rating agency fees with respect to the registrable securities, (viii) all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel selected by the holders of a majority of each class of the registrable securities being registered, (ix) all fees and expenses of accountants selected by the holders of a majority of each class of the registrable securities being registered, (x) any reasonable fees and disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by issuers or sellers of securities, (xi) all fees and expenses of any special experts or other persons retained by the company parties in connection with any registration, and (xii) all of the company parties' internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties). all such expenses are referred to herein as "registration expenses." the company parties shall not be required to pay any fees and disbursements to underwriters not customarily paid by the issuers of securities in a secondary offering, including underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of registrable securities. 2.9. indemnification. (a) indemnification by the company parties jointly and severally. subject to the last sentence of this section 2.9(a), the company parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, each member, limited partner or general partner of each such holder, each of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, members, limited partners, general partners, employees, advisors, and agents and each person who controls (within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act) such persons and each of their respective representatives from and against any and all losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims, damages, liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not such indemnified party is a party thereto) and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) (each, a "loss" and collectively "losses") arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act (including any final, preliminary or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that the company parties shall not be liable to any particular indemnified party (x) to the extent that any such loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such registration statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company parties by such indemnified party expressly for use in the preparation thereof or (y) to the extent that any such loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission in a preliminary prospectus relating to registrable securities, if a prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) that would have cured the defect was furnished to the indemnified party from whom the person asserting the claim giving rise to such loss purchased registrable securities at least 5 days prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to such person and a copy of such prospectus (as amended and supplemented) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such indemnified party to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to such person. this indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the company parties may otherwise have. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. the company parties will also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each person who controls such persons (within the meaning of the securities act and the exchange act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the indemnified parties. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the guarantors shall only be required to provide indemnification pursuant to this section 2.9 if the losses for which such indemnification is required arise out of or in connection with the purchase and sale of note securities. (b) indemnification by the selling holder of registrable securities. each selling holder of registrable securities agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company parties, their directors and officers and each person who controls the company parties (within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act) from and against any losses resulting from (i) any untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act (including any final, preliminary or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or (ii) any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by such selling holder to the company parties specifically for inclusion in such registration statement and has not been corrected in a subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the registrable securities to the person asserting the claim. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder under the sale of registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. the company parties shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above (with appropriate modification) with respect to information furnished in writing by such persons specifically for inclusion in any prospectus or registration statement. each holder also shall indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to indemnification of the company parties. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided, that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person, (iii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) in the reasonable judgment of any such person (based upon advice of its counsel) a conflict of interest may exist between such person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person). if the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle such action without the consent of the indemnified party. no indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. if such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. (d) contribution. if for any reason the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 2.9 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses referred to therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) of this section 2.9(d) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) of this section 2.9(d) but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the acts, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. in connection with any registration statement filed with the sec by the company parties, (x) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of any securities registered thereunder (before deducting expenses) received by the indemnifying party and the net proceeds from the offering of any registrable securities (before deducting expenses) received by the indemnified party, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities registered thereunder; and (y) the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses referred to in sections 2.9(a) and 2.9(b) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 2.9(d), in connection with any registration statement filed by the company, a selling holder of registrable securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder under the sale of registrable securities giving rise to such contribution obligation. if indemnification is available under this section 2.9, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in sections 2.9(a) and 2.9(b) hereof without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying parties or indemnified party. the remedies provided for in this section 2.9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. 2.10. rules 144 and 144a. the company parties covenant that they will file the reports required to be filed by them under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder (or, if the company parties are not required to file such reports, they will, upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, make publicly available such necessary information for so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to rules 144, 144a or regulation s under the securities act), and they will take such further action as any holder of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) rules 144, 144a or regulation s under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company parties will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof. section 3. miscellaneous. ------------- 3.1. term. this agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the shelf period, except for the provisions of sections 2.9 and 2.10 and all of this section 3, which shall survive any such termination. 3.2. injunctive relief. it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage that would be suffered if the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved person will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. any such person shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law or in equity) to injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. 3.3. attorneys' fees. in any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this agreement or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other available remedy. 3.4. notices. all notices, other communications or documents provided for or permitted to be given hereunder, shall be made in writing and

(a) the registration rights of any holder under this agreement with respect to any registrable securities may be transferred and assigned without the need for an express assignment, provided that, other than an assignment to the investor or an affiliate of the investor, a designated purchaser or an affiliate of a designated purchaser, a note designee or an affiliate of a note designee, no such assignment shall be binding upon or obligate the company parties to any such assignee unless and until the company shall have received notice of such assignment as herein provided and a written agreement of the assignee to be bound by the provisions of this agreement. (b) this agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns. whether or not any express assignment shall have been made, the provisions of this agreement which are for the benefit of the parties hereto other than the company parties shall also be for the benefit of and enforceable by any subsequent holder of registrable securities, subject to the provisions contained herein.

(b) to make an election pursuant to this section, the borrower shall notify the administrative agent of such election by telephone by the time that a borrowing request would be required under section 2.03 if the borrower were requesting a borrowing of the type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. each such telephonic interest election request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the administrative agent of a written interest election request in a form approved by the administrative agent and signed by the borrower. (c) each telephonic and written interest election request shall specify the following information in compliance with section 2.02: (i) the borrowing to which such interest election request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such interest election request, which shall be a business day; (iii) whether the resulting borrowing is to be an abr borrowing or a eurodollar borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting borrowing is a eurodollar borrowing, the interest period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "interest period". if any such interest election request requests a eurodollar borrowing but does not specify an interest period, then the borrower shall be deemed to have selected an interest period of one month's duration. (d) promptly following receipt of an interest election request, the administrative agent shall advise each lender of the details thereof and of such lender's portion of each resulting borrowing. (e) if the borrower fails to deliver a timely interest election request with respect to a eurodollar borrowing prior to the end of the interest period applicable thereto, then, unless such borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such interest period such borrowing shall be converted to an abr borrowing. notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the administrative agent, at the request of the required lenders, so notifies the borrower, then, so long as an event of default is continuing (i) no outstanding borrowing may be converted to or continued as a eurodollar borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each eurodollar borrowing shall be converted to an abr borrowing at the end of the interest period applicable thereto. section 2.06. termination and reduction of commitments. (a) unless previously terminated, the commitments shall terminate on the maturity date.

(c) the borrower shall notify the administrative agent of any election to terminate or reduce the commitments under paragraph (b) of this section at least three (3) business days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. promptly following receipt of any notice, the administrative agent shall advise the lenders of the contents thereof. each notice delivered by the borrower pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable, provided that a notice of termination delivered by the borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the borrower (by notice to the administrative agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. any termination or reduction of the commitments shall be permanent. each reduction of the commitments shall be made ratably among the lenders in accordance with their respective commitments. section 2.07. repayment of loans; evidence of debt.

(d) the entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error, provided that the failure of any lender or the administrative agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the borrower to repay the loans in accordance with the terms of this agreement. (e) any lender may request that loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. in such event, the borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such lender a promissory note payable to the order of such lender (or, if requested by such lender, to such lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the borrower and the administrative agent. thereafter, the loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). section 2.08. prepayment of loans. (a) the borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but subject to section 2.13), subject to the requirements of this section.

(d) prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of borrowings hereunder, the borrower shall select the borrowing or borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. (e) the borrower shall notify the administrative agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a eurodollar borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., new york city time, three (3) business days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an abr borrowing, not later than 3:00 p.m., new york city time, on the business day prior to the date of prepayment. each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment, provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment of any loans is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the commitments as contemplated by section 2.06, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with section 2.06. promptly following receipt of any such notice, the administrative agent shall advise the lenders of the contents thereof. each partial prepayment of any borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a borrowing of the same type as provided in section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment or to prepay such borrowing in full. each prepayment of a borrowing shall be applied ratably to the loans included in the prepaid borrowing. prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by section 2.10. section 2.09. fees. (a) the borrower agrees to pay to the administrative agent for the account of each lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the rate equal to 0.50% on the average daily unused amount of the commitments of such lender (disregarding for the purposes of such calculation the proviso to the last sentence of the definition of "commitment") during the period from and including the effective date to but excluding the date on which such commitment terminates (it being understood that no commitment fee shall be payable in respect of the portion of any commitment funded on the effective date). accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of march, june, september and december of each year and on the dates on which the commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the effective date. all commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). for purposes of computing commitment fees, a commitment of a lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding loans of such lender. (b) the borrower agrees to pay to the administrative agent on the effective date, for the account of the lenders, an underwriting fee in an aggregate amount equal to $3,000,000. (c) the borrower agrees to pay to the administrative agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the borrower and the administrative agent.

(e) all interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). the applicable alternate base rate or adjusted libo rate shall be determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the terms of this agreement, and such determination shall be prima facie evidence thereof absent manifest error. (f) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the borrower may elect, in each case with the consent of the required lenders to be given or withheld in their absolute discretion, to defer the cash payment of interest on any loan until a date to be agreed upon by the borrower and the required lenders. in the event that the borrower makes such an election and the required lenders so consent, the rate of interest on such loan for the period of such deferral shall be increased by an amount to be agreed between the borrower and the required lenders (which amount shall in no event be less than 3%) over the rate otherwise applicable to such loan. the lenders shall promptly notify the administrative agent of any such consent or agreement. section 2.11. alternate rate of interest. if prior to the commencement of any interest period for a eurodollar borrowing: (a) the administrative agent determines (which determination shall be prima facie evidence thereof) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the adjusted libo rate for such interest period; or (b) the administrative agent is advised by the required lenders that the adjusted libo rate for such interest period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lenders of making or maintaining their loans included in such borrowing for such interest period; then the administrative agent shall give notice thereof to the borrower and the lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the administrative agent notifies the borrower and the lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (it being understood that the administrative agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to give such notice as soon as practicable after such circumstances no longer exist), (i) any interest election request that requests the conversion of any borrowing to, or continuation of any borrowing as, a eurodollar borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any borrowing request requests a eurodollar borrowing, such borrowing shall be made as an abr borrowing. section 2.12. increased costs. (a) if any change in law (except with respect to taxes, which shall be governed by section 2.14) shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the adjusted libo rate); or (ii) impose on any lender or the london interbank market any other condition affecting this agreement or eurodollar loans made by such lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such lender of making or maintaining any eurodollar loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the borrower will pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) if any change in law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on a lender's capital or on the capital of such lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this agreement or the loans made by such lender to a level below that which such lender or such lender's holding company could have achieved but for such change in law (taking into consideration such lender's policies and the policies of such lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the borrower will pay to such lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or such lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) a certificate of a lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be delivered to the borrower and shall be prima facie evidence thereof absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) failure or delay on the part of any lender to demand compensation pursuant to this section shall not constitute a waiver of such lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate a lender pursuant to this section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such lender notifies the borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such lender's intention to claim compensation therefor, and provided further that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. section 2.13. break funding payments. in the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of an interest period applicable thereto (including as a result of an event of default), (b) the conversion of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of the interest period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any eurodollar loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under section 2.08(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any eurodollar loan other than on the last day of the interest period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the borrower pursuant to section 2.16, then, in any such event, the borrower shall compensate each lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. in the case of a eurodollar loan, such loss, cost or expense to any lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined by such lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such loan had such event not occurred, at the adjusted libo rate that would have been applicable to such loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current interest period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the interest period for such loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. a certificate of any lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this section shall be delivered to the borrower and shall be prima facie evidence thereof absent manifest error. the borrower shall pay such lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. section 2.14. taxes. (a) any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the borrower hereunder or under any other loan document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any indemnified taxes or other taxes, provided that if the borrower shall be required to deduct any indemnified taxes or other taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section) the agent or lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) in addition, the borrower shall pay any other taxes to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) the borrower shall indemnify each agent and each lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any indemnified taxes or other taxes paid by such agent or such lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the borrower hereunder or under any other loan document (including indemnified taxes or other taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such indemnified taxes or other taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the borrower by a lender or the collateral agent, or by the administrative agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a lender, shall be prima facie evidence thereof absent manifest error. (d) as soon as practicable after any payment of indemnified taxes or other taxes by the borrower to a governmental authority, the borrower shall deliver to the administrative agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent. (e) any foreign lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this agreement shall deliver to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) if an agent or a lender has received a refund of any taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the borrower or with respect to which the borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this section 2.14, which such agent or such lender is able to identify as such, it shall pay such refund to the borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the borrower under this section 2.14 with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such agent or such lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the borrower agrees to pay, upon the request of such agent or such lender, the amount paid to the borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to such agent or such lender in the event such agent or such lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. upon written request by the borrower, a lender shall use reasonable efforts to contest any taxes for which the borrower is required to pay additional amounts pursuant to this section 2.14, or to obtain refunds thereof; provided, however, that such efforts shall not require the lender to incur additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens that the lender considers in its good faith judgment to be material, and that nothing in this section 2.14(f) shall be construed as requiring a lender to alter the conduct of its business or to arrange or alter in any respect its tax or financial affairs. nothing contained in this section 2.14(f) shall require the administrative agent or any lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the borrower or any other person. section 2.15. payments generally; pro rata treatment; sharing of set-offs. (a) the borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other loan document (whether of principal, interest, or fees, or of amounts payable under section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other loan document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., new york city time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the administrative agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding business day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. all such payments shall be made to the administrative agent at its offices at citicorp usa, inc., 2 penns way, suite 200, new castle, de 19720, except that payments pursuant to sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other loan documents shall be made to the persons specified therein. the administrative agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. if any payment under any loan document shall be due on a day that is not a business day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. all payments under each loan document shall be made in dollars. (b) if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the administrative agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to fees and expenses then due to the agents hereunder, (ii) second, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (iii) third, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. (c) if any lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its loans resulting in such lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other lender, then the lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the loans of other lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective loans, provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this agreement or any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the borrower or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). the borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such lender were a direct creditor of the borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) unless the administrative agent shall have received notice from the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders hereunder that the borrower will not make such payment, the administrative agent may assume that the borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the lenders the amount due. in such event, if the borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the lenders severally agrees to repay to the administrative agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the administrative agent, at the greater of the federal funds effective rate and a rate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) if any lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to section 2.04(b), 2.15(d) or 10.03(c), then the administrative agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the administrative agent for the account of such lender to satisfy such lender's obligations under such sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. section 2.16. mitigation obligations; replacement of lenders. (a) if any lender requests compensation under section 2.12, or if the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any lender or any governmental authority for the account of any lender pursuant to section 2.14, then such lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such lender. the borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) if any lender requests compensation under section 2.12, or if the borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any lender or any governmental authority for the account of any lender pursuant to section 2.14, or if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund loans hereunder, then the borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such lender and the administrative agent, require such lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another lender, if a lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) to the extent the assignee is not a lender or an affiliate or an approved fund of a lender, the borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the administrative agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. a lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. nothing in this section 2.16 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the borrower may have against any lender as a result of any default by any such lender in its obligation to fund loans hereunder. article iii representations and warranties the borrower represents and warrants to the lenders that: section 3.01. organization; powers. each of the borrower and the subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required. section 3.02. authorization; enforceability. the loan transactions entered into and to be entered into by each loan party are within such loan party's powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the borrower and constitutes, and each other loan document to which any loan party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such loan party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the borrower or such loan party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. section 3.03. governmental approvals; no conflicts. the loan transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by or before, any governmental authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and except filings necessary to perfect liens created under the loan documents, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the borrower or any of the subsidiaries or any order of any governmental authority, (c) except as set forth on schedule 3.03, will not violate or result in a default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the borrower or any of the subsidiaries or any of their assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the borrower or any of the subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any asset of the borrower or any of the subsidiaries, except liens created under the loan documents. section 3.04. financial condition; no material adverse change.

agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act under the loan documents unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from the lenders of their indemnification obligations under section 10.03(c) hereof in respect of such action. without limiting the foregoing, neither of the agents shall have any liability or responsibility with respect to

amend any provision of, this agreement or any of the other loan documents or any collateral, nor give any notice or make any request or demand or filing thereunder, except in each instance as and to the extent instructed to do so by the required lenders, and neither of the agents shall have any liability for failure to take any action in the absence of such instructions, provided that each agent will promptly send to the lenders and the other agent a copy of each notice, request or other document delivered to such agent pursuant to the terms of this agreement and other loan documents and will take such actions contemplated by the loan documents as the required lenders may reasonably instruct, except that nothing herein or in any other loan document shall require any agent to take any

(b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, all rights of any pledgor to dividends, interest or principal that such pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the collateral agent, which shall subject to the provisions of this paragraph (b) have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest or principal. all dividends, interest or principal received by the pledgor contrary to the provisions of this section 5 shall be held in trust for the benefit of the collateral agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such pledgor and shall be forthwith delivered to the collateral agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the collateral agent pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be retained by the collateral agent in an account to be established by the collateral agent upon receipt of such money or other property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of section 7. after all events of default have been cured or waived, the collateral agent shall promptly repay to each pledgor all cash dividends, interest or principal (without interest), that such pledgor would otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(iii) above and which remain in such account. (c) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, all rights of any pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section 5, and the obligations of the collateral agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section 5, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the collateral agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers, provided that, unless otherwise directed by the required lenders, the collateral agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an event of default to permit the pledgors to exercise such rights. after all events of default have been cured or waived, each pledgor will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(i) above. section 6. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, subject to applicable regulatory and legal requirements, the collateral agent may sell the collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any pledgor, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the pledgors hereby waive all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal any pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give a pledgor 10 days' prior written notice (which each pledgor agrees is a "reasonable authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of section 9-611 of the ucc (as defined in the security agreement) of the collateral agent's intention to make any sale of such pledgor's collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid in full by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this section 6, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free from any right of redemption, stay or appraisal on the part of any pledgor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any revolver obligation then due and payable to it from such pledgor as a credit against the purchase price, and it may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such pledgor therefor. for purposes hereof, (a) a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof, (b) the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and (c) such pledgor shall not be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the revolver obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the collateral and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. section 7. application of proceeds of sale. the collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral, as well as any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of all costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the administrative agent or the collateral agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other loan document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this agreement or any of the revolver obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the collateral agent hereunder or under any other loan document on behalf of any pledgor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other loan document; second, to the payment in full of the revolver obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the revolver obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); third, to the payment in full of the indenture obligations outstanding; and fourth, to the pledgors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the collateral agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of the collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section 8. reimbursement of collateral agent. (a) each pledgor agrees to pay upon demand to the collateral agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, other charges and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts or agents, that the collateral agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the collateral agent hereunder or (iv) the failure by such pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. (b) without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other loan documents, each pledgor agrees to indemnify the collateral agent and the indemnitees (as defined in section 10.03 of the revolving credit agreement) against, and hold each indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, other charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this agreement or any other loan document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee. (c) any amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional revolver obligations secured hereby and by the other security documents. the provisions of this section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the revolver obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this agreement or any other loan document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the collateral agent or any other secured party. all amounts due under this section 8 shall be payable on written demand therefor and shall bear interest at the rate specified in section 2.10(c) of the revolving credit agreement. section 9. collateral agent appointed attorney-in-fact. each pledgor hereby appoints the collateral agent the attorney-in-fact of such pledgor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the collateral agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the collateral agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, with full power of substitution either in the collateral agent's name or in the name of such pledgor, to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of any collateral, to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other instruments for the payment of money payable to the pledgor representing any interest or dividend or other distribution payable in respect of the collateral or any part thereof or on account thereof and to give full discharge for the same, to settle, compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim or proceeding with respect thereto, and to sell, assign, endorse, pledge, transfer and to make any agreement respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the collateral agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the collateral agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. the collateral agent and the other secured parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. section 10. waivers; amendment. (a) no failure or delay of the collateral agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. the rights and remedies of the collateral agent hereunder and of the other secured parties under the other loan documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. no waiver of any provisions of this agreement or consent to any departure by any pledgor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. no notice or demand on any pledgor in any case shall entitle such pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) neither this agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the collateral agent and the pledgor or pledgors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with section 10.02 of the revolving credit agreement. section 11. securities act, etc. in view of the position of the pledgors in relation to the pledged securities, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "federal securities laws") with respect to any disposition of the pledged securities permitted hereunder. each pledgor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged securities could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged securities under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each pledgor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of the pledged securities, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged securities for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale, in either case in accordance with a valid exemption from registration under the federal securities laws. each pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged securities at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. the provisions of this section 11 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. section 12. registration, etc. each pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, if for any reason the collateral agent desires to sell any of the pledged securities at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the collateral agent, use its reasonable best efforts to take or to cause the issuer of such pledged securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the collateral agent to permit the public sale of such pledged securities. each pledgor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the collateral agent, each other secured party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, affiliates and controlling persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses to the collateral agent of legal counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such pledgor or the issuer of such pledged securities by the collateral agent or any other secured party expressly for use therein. each pledgor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its reasonable best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the issuer of such pledged securities to qualify, file or register, any of the pledged securities under the blue sky or other securities laws of such states as may be requested by the collateral agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. each pledgor will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this section 12. each pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it to comply with the provisions of this section 12 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements contained in this section 12 may be specifically enforced. section 13. security interest absolute. all rights of the collateral agent hereunder, the grant of a security interest in the collateral and all obligations of each pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the revolving credit agreement, any other loan document, any agreement with respect to any of the revolver obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the revolver obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the revolving credit agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to or departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the revolver obligations or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any pledgor in respect of the revolver obligations or in respect of this agreement (other than the indefeasible payment in full of all the revolver obligations). section 14. termination or release. (a) this agreement and the security interests granted hereby shall terminate when all the revolver obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the lenders have no further commitment to lend under the revolving credit agreement. (b) upon any sale or other transfer by any pledgor of any collateral that is permitted under the revolving credit agreement to any person that is not a pledgor, or, upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any collateral pursuant to section 10.02 of the revolving credit agreement, the security interest in such collateral shall be automatically released. (c) in connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) or section 17, the collateral agent shall execute and deliver to any pledgor, at such pledgor's expense, all documents that such pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this section 14 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the collateral agent. section 15. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in section 10.01 of the revolving credit agreement. all communications and notices hereunder to any subsidiary pledgor shall be given to it at the address or telecopy number set forth on schedule i, with a copy to the borrower. section 16. further assurances. each pledgor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the collateral agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this agreement or with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the collateral agent its rights and remedies hereunder. section 17. binding effect; several agreement; assignments. whenever in this agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any pledgor that are contained in this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns. this agreement shall become effective as to any pledgor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such pledgor shall have been delivered to the collateral agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the collateral agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such pledgor and the collateral agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such pledgor, the collateral agent and the other secured parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no pledgor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein or in the collateral (and any such attempted assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this agreement or the other loan documents. in the event that a pledgor ceases to be a subsidiary pursuant to a transaction permitted under the loan documents, such pledgor shall be released from its obligations under this agreement without further action. this agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each pledgor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any pledgor without the approval of any other pledgor and without affecting the obligations of any other pledgor hereunder. section 18. survival of agreement; severability. (a) all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by each pledgor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement or any other loan document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the collateral agent and the other secured parties and shall survive the making of the loans by the lenders regardless of any investigation made by the secured parties or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any revolver obligation remains unpaid and as long as the commitments have not been terminated. (b) in the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). the parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. section 19. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york. section 20. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in section 17. delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this agreement. section 21. rules of interpretation. the rules of interpretation specified in section 1.02 of the revolving credit agreement shall be applicable to this agreement. section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this agreement. section 22. jurisdiction; consent to service of process. (a) each pledgor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any new york state court or federal court of the united states of america sitting in new york city, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other loan documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such new york state or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. nothing in this agreement shall affect any right that the collateral agent or any other secured party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this agreement or the other loan documents against any pledgor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (b) each pledgor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other loan documents in any new york state or federal court. each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (c) each party to this agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in section 15. nothing in this agreement will affect the right of any party to this agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. section 23. waiver of jury trial. each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this agreement. each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this section. section 24. limitation on security interest. anything contained in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation hereunder secured by each subsidiary pledgor shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greatest amount that would not render such subsidiary pledgor's secured obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under section 548 of title 11 of the united states code or any provisions of applicable state law (collectively, the "fraudulent transfer laws"), in each case after giving effect to all liabilities of such subsidiary pledgor, contingent or otherwise, that would be taken into account in determining whether the incurrence of the obligation would constitute a fraudulent conveyance under the fraudulent transfer laws and after giving effect, both in determining such subsidiary pledgor's probable debt hereunder and in determining its assets, to the existence of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such subsidiary pledgor pursuant to (a) applicable law or (b) any agreement, including the indemnity, subrogation and contribution agreement. section 25. additional pledgors. pursuant to section 5.12 of the revolving credit agreement, each subsidiary loan party that was not in existence or not a subsidiary loan party on the date of the revolving credit agreement is required to enter into this agreement as a subsidiary pledgor upon becoming a subsidiary loan party. upon execution and delivery by the collateral agent and a subsidiary of an instrument in the form of annex 1, such subsidiary shall become a subsidiary pledgor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a subsidiary pledgor herein. the execution and delivery of such instrument shall not require the consent of any pledgor hereunder. the rights and obligations of each pledgor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new subsidiary pledgor as a party to this agreement. in witness whereof, the parties hereto have duly executed this agreement as of the day and year first above written. memc electronic materials, inc. by /s/ james m. stolze -------------------------------- name: james m. stolze title: executive vice president, chief financial officer by /s/ kenneth l. young -------------------------------- name: kenneth l. young title: treasurer each of the other subsidiaries listed on schedule i hereto, by /s/ kenneth l. young -------------------------------- name: kenneth l. young, in his capacity as treasurer for each of the other subsidiaries listed on schedule i hereto citicorp usa, inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent by /s/ edward t. crook -------------------------------- name: edward t. crook title: managing director and vice president exhibit f security agreement dated as of november 13, 2001, among memc electronic materials, inc., a delaware corporation (the "borrower"), each subsidiary of borrower listed on schedule i hereto (each such subsidiary individually a "subsidiary" or a "guarantor" and, collectively, the "subsidiaries" or "guarantors";

or any of the collateral; (c) to sign the name of any grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the collateral; (d) to send verifications of accounts receivable to any account debtor; (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the

to notify, or to require any grantor to notify, account debtors to make payment directly to the collateral agent; and (h) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this agreement, as fully and completely as though the collateral agent were the absolute owner of the collateral for all purposes; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the collateral agent or any secured party to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the collateral agent or any secured party, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby, and no action taken or omitted to be taken by the collateral agent or any secured party with respect to the collateral or any part thereof shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor of any grantor or to any claim or action against the collateral agent or any secured party. it is understood and agreed that the appointment of the collateral agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. the provisions of this section shall in no event relieve any grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other loan document with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or impose any obligation on the collateral agent or any secured party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the collateral agent or any secured party of any other or further right which it may have on the date of this agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other loan document, by law or otherwise. article vi remedies section 6.01. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, each grantor agrees to deliver each item of collateral to the collateral agent on demand, and it is agreed that the collateral agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any collateral consisting of intellectual property, on demand, to cause the security interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such collateral by the applicable grantors to the collateral agent (except to the extent assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would result in a loss of said intellectual property), or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, any such collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the collateral agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the ucc or other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor agrees that the collateral agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor, and each grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give the grantors 10 days' written notice (which each grantor agrees is a "reasonable authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of section 9-611 of the ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the collateral agent's intention to make any sale of collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this section, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any revolver obligation then due and payable to such secured party from any grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such secured party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. for purposes hereof a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the revolver obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this agreement and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. section 6.02. application of proceeds. the collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral, as well as any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of all costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the administrative agent or the collateral agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other loan document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this agreement or any of the revolver obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the collateral agent hereunder or under any other loan document on behalf of any grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other loan document; second, to the payment in full of the revolver obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the revolver obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution) third, to the payment in full of the indenture obligations outstanding; and fourth, to the grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the collateral agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of the collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section 6.03. grant of license to use intellectual property. for the purpose of enabling the collateral agent to exercise rights and remedies under this article at such time as the collateral agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors) to use, license or sub-license any of the collateral consisting of intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. the use of such license by the collateral agent shall be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided that any license, sub-license or other transaction entered into by the collateral agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default. article vii miscellaneous section 7.01. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in section 10.01 of the revolving credit agreement. all communications and notices hereunder to any guarantor shall be given to it at its address or telecopy number set forth on schedule i, with a copy to the borrower. section 7.02. security interest absolute. all rights of the collateral agent hereunder, the security interest and all obligations of the grantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the revolving credit agreement, any other loan document, any agreement with respect to any of the revolver obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the revolver obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the revolving credit agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the revolver obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any grantor in respect of the revolver obligations or this agreement. section 7.03. survival of agreement. all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by any grantor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the secured parties and shall survive the making by the lenders of the loans, and the execution and delivery to the lenders of any notes evidencing such loans, regardless of any investigation made by the lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect until this agreement shall terminate. section 7.04. binding effect; several agreement. this agreement shall become effective as to any grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such grantor shall have been delivered to the collateral agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the collateral agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such grantor and the collateral agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such grantor, the collateral agent and the other secured parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no grantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by this agreement or the other loan documents. this agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each grantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any grantor without the approval of any other grantor and without affecting the obligations of any other grantor hereunder. section 7.05. successors and assigns. whenever in this agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any grantor or the collateral agent that are contained in this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. section 7.06. collateral agent's fees and expenses; indemnification.

(b) tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, shall have thirty (30) days following the notice date to notify the transferor in writing of an offer to purchase in cash (the "offer to purchase") all (but not less than all) of the offered interest at the purchase price and upon the other terms and conditions specified in the offer notice. if the transferor does not receive a written notice from tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, containing the offer to purchase within the thirty (30) day period, tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have declined to purchase the offered interest and the transferor may, subject to compliance with the provisions of paragraph 5 (d), thereafter transfer to a purchaser at any time within ninety (90) days following the notice date all (but not less than all) of the offered interest at a price which is not less than the purchase price specified in the offer notice and upon substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the offer notice; provided that if tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, notifies the transferor in writing, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a notice from the transferor of the name of a possible purchaser, of an objection to the possible purchaser because tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, in its reasonable discretion, determines that the purchaser or one or more of its affiliates is engaged in a business that competes with memc or any of its subsidiaries, the transferor shall not have the right to transfer any of the offered interest to such possible purchaser; and provided further that if the offered interest is not transferred to a purchaser for any reason within ninety (90) days following the notice date, then such offered interest may be transferred only by again complying with all of the terms and procedures set forth in this paragraph 5. (c) in the event that pursuant to the offer to purchase tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, agrees to purchase all (but not less than all) of the offered interest on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer notice, the closing for such transaction shall take place at a time and place reasonably acceptable to the transferor and tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be; provided that such closing shall not occur more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the transferor receives the offer to purchase. at such closing, tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, shall deliver to the transferor the consideration to be exchanged for such offered interest, in immediately available funds, and the transferor shall deliver to tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, all documents required to effect the sale of such offered interest, duly endorsed and free of any liens, including appropriate documentation providing indemnities to tpg to tpg wp, as the case may be, regarding its title to such offered interest. (d) as soon as practicable, but in any event no less than thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of a proposed sale of offered interest to a purchaser pursuant to paragraph 5(b), the transferor shall give written notice to the lenders and tpg, which notice shall specify with respect to each such proposed sale the name or names of one or more possible purchasers, provided that in no event shall such notice specify more than five possible purchasers. the transferor shall not sell the offered interest to a purchaser unless the transferor has given a notice pursuant to the preceding sentence that such purchaser is a possible purchaser. as soon as practicable, but in any event no less than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a sale of offered interest to a purchaser pursuant to paragraph 5(b), the transferor shall give written notice to tpg, which notice shall specify with respect to each such proposed sale: (i) the identity of the purchaser, (ii) the cash purchase price to be paid by such purchaser for the offered interest, (iii) the date of the proposed transfer and (iv) any other material items and conditions of the proposed sale. 6. tag-along rights. (a) if tpg or tpg wp or any of their affiliates proposes to transfer any revolver interests, participation interests, interests or rights under or in connection with the italian credit agreement or related agreements in respect of collateral ("italian credit agreement rights"), senior notes, or warrants to a purchaser other than a permitted transferee of tpg or tpg wp, tpg or tpg wp or any of their affiliates (hereinafter referred to as the "selling tpg party") shall give written notice (a "transfer notice") of such proposed transfer to the lenders other than the selling tpg party (the "other lenders") at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of such proposed transfer, setting forth (i) the identity of the purchaser, (ii) the consideration to be received by the other lenders, (iii) the date of the proposed transfer, (iv) the amount of the revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes or warrants offered, as the case may be, and, if applicable, the portion of the indebtedness under the italian credit agreement proposed to be transferred, (v) any other material items and conditions of the proposed sale and (vi) that each such other lenders shall have the right to elect to sell up to the pro rata portion (as defined below) of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be. (b) upon delivery of a transfer notice, each other lender may elect to sell up to the pro rata portion of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants as the case may be, pursuant to the same terms and conditions with respect to payment for the interest as agreed to by the selling tpg party, by sending written notice to the selling tpg party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the transfer notice, indicating its election to sell up to the pro rata portion of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, in the same transaction, in which case the portion of revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, to be sold by the selling tpg party shall be reduced by such amount (with the result that each selling tpg party and each such electing other lender shall sell to the purchaser the same percentage of their respective revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be). following such thirty (30) day period, each other lender, concurrently with the selling tpg party, shall be permitted to sell to the purchaser, at any time up to ninety (90) days after the delivery of the transfer notice, on terms set forth in the transfer notice the pro rata portion of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be; provided, however, that no selling tpg party shall be permitted to sell to the purchaser unless, simultaneously with the consummation of such sale, the sale by the other lenders who have elected to sell pursuant to this paragraph (ii) of the pro rata portion of their revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants is also consummated. (c) for purposes of this agreement, "pro rata portion" shall mean, with respect to revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, the portion attained by multiplying (a) the aggregate interests then held by such lender in such revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes or warrants, as the case may be, by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the aggregate amount of the revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants proposed to be sold by the selling tpg party to the purchaser as set forth in the transfer notice, as the case may be, and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate amount of the revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, then outstanding (including such revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants proposed to be sold by the selling tpg party, if any). (d) for the purposes of this paragraph 6 and paragraph 7, the term "participation interests" shall include the interests of tpg, tpg wp or any of their affiliates with respect to the italian credit agreement which are held directly by such person or entity, rather than being subject to the participation interests of other entities. 7. drag-along rights. in the event that tpg or tpg wp wishes to sell all or substantially all of (i) its revolver interests, (ii) its participation interests, (iii) the senior notes held by tpg wp, or (iv) the warrants held by tpg wp, in each case by merger, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise (other than pursuant to paragraph 8 of this agreement) to a purchaser that is not an affiliate of tpg or tpg wp or any of their affiliates and said purchaser desires to acquire all or substantially all of the outstanding revolver interests, participation interests, italian credit agreement rights, senior notes or warrants, as the case may be, upon such terms and conditions as agreed to with tpg or tpg wp, each other lender agrees to sell all of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants as the case may be, to said purchaser and to waive its appraisal or dissenters' rights with respect to such transaction, at a price that reflects the pro rata portion of its revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, and on the same terms and conditions as tpg or tpg wp have agreed to with such purchaser; provided, however, that no lender required to sell pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall be required to make any representation, covenant or warranty in connection with such sale, other than as to its ownership and authority to sell, free of liens, claims or encumbrances, the revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants to be sold by such lender. in such case, tpg or tpg wp, as the case may be, shall give written notice of such sale to the other lenders at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of such sale, setting forth (i) the consideration to be received by such lenders, (ii) the identity of the purchaser, (iii) the date of the proposed transfer and (iv) any other material items and conditions of the proposed transfer. 8. permitted transfers. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, transfers to any permitted transferee of a lender shall not be subject to paragraph 5, 6 or 7. for purposes of this agreement, a "permitted transferee" means (a) in the case of any transferor that is not a corporation or individual, any present or former general or limited partner, member, managing director, officer, employee or affiliate (as defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) of such transferor, (b) in the case of any transferor that is a corporation, any other entity that owns, directly or indirectly, at least 51% of the equity securities of such transferor ("majority ownership") or that is under common majority ownership with such transferor, (c) in the case of any transferor that is an individual, any successor by death or divorce, (d) in the case of any transferor that is a trust whose sole beneficiaries are individuals, such individuals or their spouses or lineal descendants or (e) in the case of tpg or tpg wp, any officers or directors of memc or other persons providing consulting or other services to memc (excluding in each case any tpg deal professionals or any tpg affiliate (as defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")), so long as such revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, constitute less than 10% of the aggregate revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants, as the case may be, on the date hereof. 9. transferee's rights and obligations. any party that acquires any revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants shall assume the obligations and, unless otherwise agreed by the transferee, acquire the rights of the transferor with respect to such revolver interests, participation interests, senior notes, or warrants that it acquires; provided that, unless a majority in interest of the other parties to this agreement have approved of the transferee in writing, the transferor shall remain liable for all of its obligations under the revolving credit agreement and under this agreement. in connection with such assumption, the transferee will notify the parties hereto of its address for the purpose of providing notices hereunder. 10. amendments. any amendment of this agreement or any waiver of any provision hereof to be effective shall be in writing and signed by all of the parties hereto. any failure by any party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this agreement shall not be construed a waiver of such provision or any other provisions hereof. 11. governing law. the validity, construction and performance of this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of new york without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws except section 5-1401 of the general obligations law of the state of new york. 12. arbitration. any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved by exclusive and final arbitration to be carried out in accordance with the procedures described in section 11.10 of the amended and restated operating agreement of tpg wafer holdings llc ("wafer holdings"), dated as of november 13, 2001. 13. counterparts. this agreement may be signed by each party hereto upon a separate copy of this agreement in which event all of said copies shall constitute a single counterpart of this agreement. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. 14. notices. unless otherwise specified herein, any and all notices, offers, acceptances and other communications (collectively, "notices") authorized or required to be given pursuant to this agreement shall be given in writing, by registered or certified mail, which shall be addressed to the member at the following addresses (or at such other address for a member as shall be specified by like notice): if to tpg, tpg wp or tpg wafer management, to: c/o texas pacific group 301 commerce street, suite 3300 fort worth, texas 76102 attention: richard a. ekleberry telephone: 817.871.4080 fax: 817.871.4088 with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to: cleary, gottlieb, steen & hamilton one liberty plaza new york, ny 10006 attention: michael a. gerstenzang, esq. telephone: 212.225.2000 fax: 212.225.3999 if to tcw, to: c/o tcw/crescent mezzanine partners iii, l.p. 11100 santa monica boulevard, suite 2000 los angeles, california 90025 attention: jean-marc chapus telephone: 310.235.5900 fax: 310.235.5967 with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to: kramer levin naftalis & frankel llp 919 third avenue new york, ny 10022-3852 attention: howard a. sobel, esq. telephone: 212.715.9326 fax: 212.715.8000 if to lgp, to: c/o leonard green & partners, l.p. 11111 santa monica boulevard, suite 2000 los angeles, california 90025 attention: john baumer telephone: 310.954.0416 fax: 310.954.0404 with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to: kramer levin naftalis & frankel llp 919 third avenue new york, ny 10022-3852 attention: howard a. sobel, esq. telephone: 212.715.9326 fax: 212.715.8000 all notices, other communications or documents shall be deemed to have been duly given five (5) business days after having been deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed by first class mail;
