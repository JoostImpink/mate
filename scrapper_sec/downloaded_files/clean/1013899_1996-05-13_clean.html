a copy of the prospectus dated april 30, 1996 relating to the offering: (a) by the underwriters named therein (the "underwriters") of 2,100,000 shares of common stock (the "underwritten shares") of the jpm company (the "company"), of which 1,876,800 shares are being sold by the company and 223,200 shares are being sold by certain shareholders of the company (the "selling shareholders") and (b) by the company of 232,635 shares of common stock (the "exchange shares"). the company is offering the exchange shares through its officers on a best efforts basis on the terms and in the manner described in the prospectus under the caption "certain transactions--preferred stock exchange and redemption." 1. exchange. subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the undersigned trustee hereby agrees to exchange the 17,700 shares of the company's class a preferred stock (the "preferred shares") owned of record by the trust of john h. mathias (the "trust") for 77,691 exchange shares. the undersigned trustee acknowledges that the number of exchange shares being offered in exchange for the preferred shares (the "trust exchange shares") has been calculated by multiplying the number of preferred shares owned by the trust by $32.92, the price per share at which such preferred shares are redeemable by the company, and dividing the product so determined by $7.50, the initial public offering price for the underwritten shares. the trustee is hereby delivering to the company a certificate or certificates representing the preferred shares, duly endorsed for transfer, against delivery by the company of a certificate registered in the name of the trust representing the trust exchange shares. 2. representations of the trust. on behalf of the trust, the undersigned trustee represents and warrants to the company as follows: a. the trust is the record and beneficial owner of the preferred shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances or restrictions of any kind; b. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the exchange contemplated hereby does not violate any provision of the declaration of trust pursuant to which the trust was created or any agreement, document or other instrument or obligation to which the trust is a party or by which the trust or any of the preferred shares is bound or affected; and c. the trust acknowledges and understands that the company is redeeming 58,840 shares of the company's class a preferred stock, with respect to which no exchange offer is being made, for cash in the amount of $32.92 per share and that, if the trust did not accept the exchange described in the prospectus and in this agreement, the company would also have redeemed the preferred shares owned by the trust for cash in the amount of $32.92 per preferred share. 3. restrictions on transferability of the exchange shares. in consideration of the company's agreement to exchange the preferred shares for the trust exchange shares, the trust hereby agrees to the following restrictions on transferability of the trust exchange shares: a. without the prior written consent of janney montgomery scott inc. and advest inc., as representatives of the underwriters (the "representatives"), the trust will not, at any time from the effective date (the "effective date") of the company's registration statement on form s-1 filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), as the same may be amended, pursuant to which the exchange shares were registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), and for a period of 180 days thereafter, directly or indirectly offer to sell, sell, contract to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of, any of the trust exchange shares (otherwise than in private transactions to the spouse, children, descendants, parents or grandparents of the beneficiaries of the trust or to another trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust or any of their respective spouses, children, descendants, parents or grandparents, provided that each such transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this section 3). the trust further agrees that, without the prior written consent of the representatives, the trust will not exercise any demand, mandatory, piggyback, optional or any other registration rights with respect to the trust exchange shares for a period of 180 days from the effective date. b. during the period commencing 180 days after the effective date, the trust agrees that it will not sell any trust exchange shares if and to the extent that such trust exchange shares, if they constituted "restricted securities" as defined in rule 144(a)(3) promulgated by the sec under the act, could not be sold in accordance with the volume limitations set forth in rule 144(e), as such rule may be amended from time to time. c. the trust acknowledges and agrees that the representatives are intended third party beneficiaries of the provisions of this section 3 and that they shall be permitted to enforce any violation hereof as if they were parties hereto. in witness whereof, the undersigned has executed this agreement as of
