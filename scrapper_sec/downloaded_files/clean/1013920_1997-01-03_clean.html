furnishing information. 2.7.1 no holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this article ii. 2.7.2 it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 that the selling holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of their registrable securities. 2.8 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4: 2.8.1 to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, the partners, officers, directors and legal counsel of each holder, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation") by the company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation 9. 12 promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the company will reimburse each such holder, partner, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.8.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such holder, partner, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person of such holder. 2.8.2 to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration qualifications or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, its officers, and legal counsel and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other holder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such holder, or partner, director, officer or controlling person of such other holder may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder under an instrument duly executed by such holder and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other holder, or partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.8.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this section 2.8 exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 2.8.3 promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 2.8 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 2.8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel 10. 13 retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 2.8, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 2.8. 2.8.4 if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a holder hereunder exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 2.8.5 the obligations of the company and holders under this section 2.8 shall survive completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 2.9 assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities pursuant to this article ii may be assigned by a holder to a transferee or assignee of registrable securities which (i) is a subsidiary, parent, general partner, limited partner or retired partner of a holder, (ii) is a holder's family member or trust for the benefit of an individual holder, or (iii) acquires at least eighty-three thousand (83,000) shares of registrable securities (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations); provided, however, (a) the transferor shall, within ten (10) days after such transfer, furnish to the company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (b) such transferee shall agree to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this agreement. 2.10 amendment of registration rights. any provision of this article ii may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the company and the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities. any amendment or waiver effected 11. 14 in accordance with this section 2.11 shall be binding upon each holder and the company. by acceptance of any benefits under this article ii, holders of registrable securities hereby agree to be bound by the provisions hereunder. 2.11 limitation on subsequent registration rights. after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company that would grant such holder registration rights senior to those granted to the holders hereunder. 2.12 "market stand-off" agreement. if requested by the company as the representative of the underwriters of common stock (or other securities) of the company, each holder shall not sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares common stock (or other securities) of the company held by such each holder (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of a registration statement of the company filed under the securities act, provided that: (i) such agreement shall apply only to the company's initial offering; and (ii) all officers and directors of the company shall enter into similar agreements. the obligations described in this section 2.12 shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on form s-1 or form s-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a commission rule 145 transaction on form s-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future. the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of common stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred eighty (180) day period. 2.13 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to use its best efforts to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in sec rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the securities act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration filed by the company for an offering of its securities to the general public; (b) file with the sec, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the company under the exchange act; (c) so long as a holder owns any registrable securities, furnish to such holder forthwith upon request: a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144 of the securities act, and of the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements); a copy of the most recent 12. 15 annual or quarterly report of the company; and such other reports and documents as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing it to sell any such securities without registration. iii. rights of first refusal. 3.1 subsequent offerings. each investor shall have a right of first refusal to purchase its pro rata share of all equity securities, as defined below, that the company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue after the date of this agreement, other than the equity securities excluded by section 3.6 hereof. each investor's pro rata share is equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the company's common stock that are held by such investor plus the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of any warrant held by such investor immediately prior to the issuance of such equity securities to (b) the total number of shares of the company's common stock outstanding plus the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants immediately prior to the issuance of the equity securities. the term "equity securities" shall mean (i) any common stock, preferred stock or other security of the company, (ii) any security convertible, with or without consideration, into any common stock, preferred stock or other security (including any option to purchase such a convertible security), (iii) any security carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any common stock, preferred stock or other security or (iv) any such warrant or right. 3.2 exercise of rights. if the company proposes to issue any equity securities, it shall give each investor written notice of its intention, describing the equity securities, the price and the terms and conditions upon which the company proposes to issue the same. each investor shall have fifteen (15) days from the giving of such notice to agree to purchase up to its pro rata share of the equity securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice to the company and stating therein the quantity of equity securities to be purchased. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be required to offer or sell such equity securities to any investor who would cause the company to be in violation of applicable federal securities laws by virtue of such offer or sale. 3.3 issuance of equity securities to other persons. if not all of the investors elect to purchase their pro rata share of the equity securities, then the company shall promptly notify in writing the investors who do so elect and shall offer such investors the right to acquire such unsubscribed shares. the investors shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to notify the company of its election to purchase all or a portion thereof of the unsubscribed shares. if the investors fail to exercise in full the rights of first refusal, the company shall have ninety (90) days thereafter to sell the equity securities in respect of which the investor's rights were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms and conditions materially no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the company's notice to the investors pursuant to section 3.2 hereof. if the company has not sold such equity securities within days of the notice provided pursuant to section 3.2, the company shall not thereafter issue or sell any equity securities, without first offering such securities to the investors in the manner provided above. 13. 16 3.4 termination of rights of first refusal. the rights of first refusal set forth in sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 above shall terminate upon the closing date of the registration statement pertaining to a qualified public offering. 3.5 transfer of rights of first refusal. the rights of first refusal of each investor under this article iii may be transferred to the same parties, subject to the same restrictions, as any transfer of registration rights pursuant to section 2.9. 3.6 excluded securities. the rights of first refusal established by this article iii shall have no application to any of the following equity securities: 3.6.1 shares of common stock (and/or options, warrants or other common stock purchase rights issued pursuant to such options, warrants or other rights) issued or to be issued to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the company or any subsidiary, pursuant to stock purchase or stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the board of directors; 3.6.2 stock issued pursuant to any rights or agreements outstanding as of the date of this agreement, options and warrants (other than options, warrants or other common stock purchase rights covered by section 3.6.1 above) outstanding as of the date of this agreement; and stock issued pursuant to any such rights or agreements granted after the date of this agreement, provided that the rights of first refusal established by this article iii applied with respect to the initial sale or grant by the company of such rights or agreements; 3.6.3 any equity securities issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar business combination; 3.6.4 shares of common stock issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization by the company; 3.6.5 any equity securities issued pursuant to any equipment leasing arrangement, or bank financing; 3.6.6 any equity securities that are issued by the company pursuant to a registration statement filed under the securities act; and 3.6.7 shares of the company's common stock or preferred stock issued in connection with strategic transactions involving the company and other entities, including (a) joint ventures, manufacturing, marketing or distribution arrangements or (b) technology transfer or development arrangements; provided that such strategic transactions and the issuance of shares therein, has been approved by the company's board of directors. 3.7 catch-up rights. in the event the company (a) issues any shares of common stock and/or grants any options, warrants or other common stock purchase rights exercisable for common stock in a transaction that is not subject to the right of first refusal established by this article iii by reason of section 3.6.1 and after such transaction the employee stock pool, as hereinafter defined, is greater than 1,500,000 (as adjusted appropriately for any stock splits, 14. 17 stock dividends or other such changes in the capitalization of the company) or (b) issues any equity securities in a transaction that is not subject to the right of first refusal established by this article iii by reason of sections 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 3.6.6 (unless such offering is for a qualified public offering) or 3.6.7, the company will give vobis written notice of such grant or issuance not later that ten (10) days after it has occurred, providing relevant details of the transaction including the purchase price of the equity securities issued and the vobis purchase price (as defined below). for purposes hereof, the employee stock pool, as of a given date, shall be the sum of (i) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options, warrants or other common stock purchase rights granted to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the company or any subsidiary ("employee rights") and then outstanding and (ii) the number of shares of common stock previously issued upon exercise of employee rights outstanding at any time after the date of this agreement, minus the number of any such shares of common stock as to which vobis has previously been given notice in respect of its rights hereunder (all such numbers having been adjusted appropriately for any stock splits, stock dividends or other such changes in the capitalization of the company). for purposes of this section 3.7, the "vobis purchase price" shall mean the purchase price for which the vobis group (as defined below) may exercise its rights under this section 3.7 to purchase securities from the company which shall equal: (i) in the case of direct issuances of common stock under (a) above, the fair market value of the common stock on the date of issuance; (ii) in the case of the issuances of employee rights under (a) above, the fair market of the underlying common stock on the date of grant of such employee right; (iii) in the case of any equity securities covered by (b) above, the actual price paid or payable with respect to such equity securities; and (iv) in the event the consideration for the equity securities issued by the company under (a) or (b) above was other than cash, the fair market value of such consideration as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company as of the date of issuance of such equity securities; provided, however, that notwithstanding the above, if the fair market value as determined in (i) or (ii) above is higher than the price paid or payable in connection with any issuances under (i) or (ii) above, then the vobis purchase price shall equal the average of such fair market value and such actual purchase price paid or payable for such issuance. vobis and any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries holding registrable securities (collectively, the "vobis group") shall have the right, exercisable at any time within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, to purchase from the company at the vobis purchase price specified that number of equity securities (which shall be common stock in the case of any employee rights) as is necessary to restore its percentage ownership interest (determined in accordance with section 3.1) to the percentage ownership interest of the vobis group immediately prior to such issuance, but in no event to greater than seventeen and one-half percent (17.5%). notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of transactions involving the issuance of common stock and employee rights representing less than three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the common stock outstanding immediately prior to the first of such transactions, the company may at its election defer giving such notice until issuances in that and any subsequent transactions as to which notice has been deferred hereunder, constitute in the aggregate three and one-half percent (3.5%) or more of the common stock outstanding. in such case, the notice given by the company shall specify the information called for herein with respect to each such transaction, and the right of the vobis group to purchase with respect to all such transactions shall be at the vobis purchase price applicable to the shares of common stock sold or issuable upon exercise of employee rights granted in such transactions. the rights granted to the vobis group under this section 3.7 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect on the earlier of (a) the 15. 18 closing date of a qualified public offering or (b) on the day prior to a transaction (or the first of a series of transactions to be covered by a deferred notice) to which this section 3.7 would otherwise apply, if on such date the percentage ownership interest of the vobis group (determined in accordance with section 3.1) is less than eight percent (8%). notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a qualified public offering in which the company offers in excess of 1,500,000 shares, as presently constituted (including any shares to be offered under any overallotment option), the company agrees to give the vobis group the opportunity to purchase in a single transaction up to twelve percent (12.0%) of such excess in such offering. any right to purchase equity securities under this section 3.7 may be allocated among the members of the vobis group on such basis as vobis may determine. iv. miscellaneous. 4.1 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california as applied to agreements among california residents entered into and to be performed entirely within california. 4.2 survival. the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements made herein shall survive any investigation made by any holder and the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby. 4.3 successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators of the parties hereto and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each person who shall be a holder of registrable securities from time to time; provided, however, that prior to the receipt by the company of adequate written notice of the transfer of any registrable securities specifying the full name and address of the transferee, the company may deem and treat the person listed as the holder of such shares in its records as the absolute owner and holder of such shares for all purposes, including the payment of dividends or any redemption price. 4.4 severability. in case any provision of the agreement shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 4.5 amendment and waiver. except as otherwise expressly provided, this agreement may be amended or modified, and the observance of any term of this agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only upon the written consent of the company and the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities; provided, however, only vobis may waive or amend the rights granted under section 3.7. 4.6 delays or omissions. it is agreed that no delay or omission to exercise any right, power, or remedy accruing to any holder, upon any breach, default or noncompliance of the company under this agreement shall impair any such right, power, or remedy, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach, default or noncompliance, or any acquiescence therein, or of any similar breach, default or noncompliance thereafter occurring. it is further 16. 19 agreed that any waiver, permit, consent, or approval of any kind or character on any holder's part of any breach, default or noncompliance under the agreement or any waiver on such holder's part of any provisions or conditions of this agreement must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. all remedies, either under this agreement, by law, or otherwise afforded to holders, shall be cumulative and not alternative. 4.7 notices. all notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, (iii) if to an investor located in the united states, five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) if to an investor located in the united states, one (1) day, and if to an investor located outside of the united states, four (4) business days, after deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying express delivery, with written verification of receipt. all communications shall be sent to the party to be notified at the address as set forth on the signature pages hereof or exhibit a hereto or at such other address as such party may designate by ten (10) days advance written notice to the other parties hereto. 4.8 attorneys' fees. in the event that any dispute among the parties to this agreement should result in litigation, the prevailing party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover from the losing party all fees, costs and expenses of enforcing any right of such prevailing party under or with respect to this agreement, including without limitation, such reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants, which shall include, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of appeals. 4.9 titles and subtitles. the titles of the sections and subsections of this agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construing this agreement. 4.10 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. 4.11 termination of prior agreements. the investors hereby agree to the termination of (i) that certain investors' rights agreement, dated as of september 30, 1995 (the "rights agreement") and (ii) sections 6 and 7 of that certain common stock purchase agreement, dated as of july 17, 1995 (the "prior agreement"), and hereby agree that the company shall have no further obligations under the rights agreement and sections 6 and 7 of the prior agreement and that the rights granted hereunder are in lieu thereof. as required by section 4.5 of the rights agreement and section 8.4 of the prior agreement, the undersigned represent at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the registrable securities and all of the purchasers, respectively, thereunder. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless otherwise amended or modified by this section 4.11, the rights and obligations of the parties under the prior agreement (excluding sections 6 and 7 thereof) shall remain in full force and effect. 17. 20 18. 21 [this space intentionally left blank] 19. 22 in witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this investors' rights agreement as of the date set forth in the first paragraph hereof. company investors award software international, inc. venrock

of such holder. 1.2 net issue exercise. notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, in lieu of exercising this warrant for cash, the holder may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the company together with the properly endorsed form of subscription and notice of such election in which event the company shall issue to the holder a number of shares of common stock computed using the following formula: x=y(a-b) ------ a where x= the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the holder y= the number of shares of common stock purchasable under the warrant or, if only a portion of the warrant is being exercised, the portion of the warrant being canceled (at the date of such calculation) a= the fair market value of one share of the company's common stock (at the date of such calculation) b= stock purchase price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation) 2. 3 for purposes of the above calculation, fair market value of one share of common stock shall be determined by the company's board of directors in good faith; provided, however, that in the event the company makes an initial public offering of its common stock the fair market value per share shall be the average of the closing prices of such security's sales on all domestic securities exchanges on which such security may at the time be listed, or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on any day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day such security is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted in the nasdaq system as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or, if on any day such security is not quoted in the nasdaq system, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporation, or any similar successor organization, in each such case averaged over a period of 21 days consisting of the day as of which "fair market value" is being determined and the 20 consecutive business days prior to such day; provided that if such security is listed on any domestic securities exchange the term "business days" as used in this sentence means business days on which such exchange is open for trading; provided, further, that if the warrant is exercised at or immediately prior to the qualified public offering of its common stock, the fair market value per share be the per share offering price to the public of such qualified public offering. 2. shares to be fully paid; reservation of shares. the company covenants and agrees that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant will, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive rights of any shareholder and free of all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. the company further covenants and agrees that during the period within which the rights represented by this warrant may be exercised, the company will at all times have authorized and reserved, for the purpose of issue or transfer upon exercise of the subscription rights evidenced by this warrant, a sufficient number of shares of authorized but unissued common stock, or other securities and property, when and as required to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant. the company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of common stock may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any domestic securities exchange upon which the common stock may be listed; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to effect a registration under federal or state securities laws with respect to such exercise. the company will not take any action which would result in any adjustment of the stock purchase price (as defined in section 3 hereof) (i) if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after such action upon exercise of all outstanding warrants, together with all shares of common stock then outstanding and all shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of all options and upon the conversion of all convertible securities then outstanding, would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the company's articles of incorporation, or (ii) if the total number of shares of common stock issuable after such action upon the conversion of all such shares of common stock, together with all shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of all options and upon the conversion of all such shares of common stock, together with all shares of common stock then outstanding and all shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise of all options and upon the conversion of all convertible securities then outstanding 3. 4 would exceed the total number of shares of common stock then authorized by the company's articles of incorporation. 3. adjustment of stock purchase price and number of shares. the stock purchase price and the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events described in this section 3. upon each adjustment of the stock purchase price, the holder of this warrant shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the stock purchase price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares obtained by multiplying the stock purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the stock purchase price resulting from such adjustment. 3.1 subdivision or combination of stock. in case the company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the stock purchase price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock of the company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the stock purchase price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. 3.2 dividends in common stock, other stock, property, reclassification. if at any time or from time to time the holders of common stock (or any shares of stock or other securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this warrant) shall have received or become entitled to receive, without payment therefor, (a) common stock or any shares of stock or other securities which are at any time directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other distribution, (b) any cash paid or payable otherwise than as a cash dividend, or (c) common stock or additional stock or other securities or property (including cash) by way of spinoff, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement, (other than (i) shares of common stock issued as a stock split, adjustments in respect of which shall be covered by the terms of section 3.1 above or (ii) an event for which adjustment is otherwise made pursuant to section 3.4 below), then and in each such case, the holder hereof shall, upon the exercise of this warrant, be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional consideration therefor, the amount of stock and other securities and property (including cash in the cases referred to in clauses (b) and (c) above) which such holder would hold on the date of such exercise had he been the holder of record of such common stock as of the date on which holders of common stock received or became entitled to receive such shares or all other additional stock and other securities and property. 4. 5 3.3 reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. if any capital reorganization of the capital stock of the company, or any consolidation or merger of the company with another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, or other assets or property, then, as a condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby the holder hereof shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the shares of the common stock of the company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented hereby) such shares of stock, securities or other assets or property as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such common stock equal to the number of shares of such stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented hereby. in any reorganization described above, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holder of this warrant to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustments of the stock purchase price and of the number of shares purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. the company will not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor corporation (if other than the company) resulting from such consolidation or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument, executed and mailed or delivered to the registered holder hereof at the last address of such holder appearing on the books of the company, the obligation to deliver to such holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to purchase. 3.4 other notices. if at any time: (1) the company shall declare any cash dividend upon its common stock; (2) the company shall declare any dividend upon its common stock payable in stock or make any special dividend or other distribution to the holders of its common stock; (3) the company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its common stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (4) there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the company; or consolidation or merger of the company with, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation; (5) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company; or (6) there shall be an initial public offering of company securities; 5. 6 then, in any one or more of said cases, the company shall give written notice to the holder of this warrant at the address of such holder as shown on the books of the company, (a) at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of the date on which the books of the company shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights or for determining rights to vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and (b) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or public offering, at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place; provided, however, that the holder shall make a best efforts attempt to respond to such notice as early as possible after the receipt thereof. any notice given in accordance with the foregoing clause (a) shall also specify, in the case of any such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled thereto. any notice given in accordance with the foregoing clause (b) shall also specify the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up, conversion or public offering, as the case may be. 3.5 certain events. if any change in the outstanding common stock of the company or any other event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 3 are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the purchase rights of the holder of the warrant in accordance with such provisions, then the board of directors of the company shall make an adjustment in the number and class of shares available under the warrant, the stock purchase price or the application of such provisions, so as to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. the adjustment shall be such as will give the holder of the warrant upon exercise for the same aggregate stock purchase price the total number, class and kind of shares as he would have owned had the warrant been exercised prior to the event and had he continued to hold such shares until after the event requiring adjustment. 4. issue tax. the issuance of certificates for shares of common stock upon the exercise of the warrant shall be made without charge to the holder of the warrant for any issue tax (other than any applicable income taxes) in respect thereof; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the then holder of the warrant being exercised. 5. closing of books. the company will at no time close its transfer books against the transfer of any warrant or of any shares of common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of any warrant in any manner which interferes with the timely exercise of this warrant. 6. no voting or dividend rights; limitation of liability. nothing contained in this warrant shall be construed as conferring upon the holder hereof the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder of the company or any other matters or any rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the company. no dividends or interest shall be payable or accrued in respect of this warrant or the interest represented hereby or the shares 6. 7 purchasable hereunder until, and only to the extent that, this warrant shall have been exercised. no provisions hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by the holder to purchase shares of common stock, and no mere enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the holder hereof, shall give rise to any liability of such holder for the stock purchase price or as a shareholder of the company, whether such liability is asserted by the company or by its creditors. 7. registration rights agreement. the registration rights of the holder (including holders' successors) with respect to the stock underlying this warrant will be the same as granted to the holders of the company's common stock under that certain investors' rights agreement of even date herewith (the "investors' rights agreement"). 8. warrants transferable. subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and the transfer restrictions set forth in the investors' rights agreement, this warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, without charge to the holder hereof (except for transfer taxes), upon surrender of this warrant properly endorsed and compliance with the provisions of the investors' rights agreement. each taker and holder of this warrant, by taking or holding the same, consents and agrees that this warrant, when endorsed in blank, shall be deemed negotiable, and that the holder hereof, when this warrant shall have been so endorsed, may be treated by the company, at the company's option, and all other persons dealing with this warrant as the absolute owner hereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by this warrant, or to the transfer hereof on the books of the company any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; but until such transfer on such books, the company may treat the registered owner hereof as the owner for all purposes. 9. rights and obligations survive exercise of warrant. the rights and obligations of the company, of the holder of this warrant and of the holder of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of this warrant, referred to in sections 7 and 8 shall survive the exercise of this warrant. 10. modification and waiver. this warrant and any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the same is sought. 11. notices. all notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on the next business day, or (iii) four (4) business days, after deposit with an internationally recognized overnight courier, specifying express delivery, with written verification of receipt. all communications shall be sent to the party to be notified at the address as shown on the books of the company or at such other address as such party may designate by ten (10) days advance written notice to the other parties hereto. 12. binding effect on successors. this warrant shall be binding upon any corporation succeeding the company by merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all of the company's assets. all of the obligations of the company relating to the 7. 8 common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall survive the exercise and termination of this warrant. all of the covenants and agreements of the company shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the holder hereof. 13. descriptive headings and governing law. the description headings of the several sections and paragraphs of this warrant are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a

(the "company") from the company pursuant to the exercise or conversion of certain warrants to purchase common stock held by purchaser. the common stock will be issued to purchaser in a transaction not involving a public offering and pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (the "1933 act") and applicable state securities laws. in connection with such purchase and in order to comply with the exemptions from registration relied upon by the company, purchaser represents, warrants and agrees as follows: purchaser is acquiring the common stock for its own account, to hold for investment, and purchaser shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the common stock in violation of the 1933 act or the general rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") or in violation of any applicable state securities law. purchaser has been advised that the common stock has not been registered under the 1933 act or state securities laws on the ground that this transaction is exempt from registration, and that reliance by the company on such exemptions is predicated in part on purchaser's representations set forth in this letter. purchaser has been informed that under the 1933 act, the common stock must be held indefinitely unless it is subsequently registered under the 1933 act or unless an exemption from such registration (such as rule 144) is available with respect to any proposed transfer or disposition by purchaser of the common stock. purchaser further agrees that the company may refuse to permit purchaser to sell, transfer or dispose of the common stock (except as permitted 1. 12 under rule 144) unless there is in effect a registration statement under the 1933 act and any applicable state securities laws covering such transfer, or unless purchaser furnishes an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the company, to the effect that such registration is not required. purchaser also understands and agrees that there will be placed on the certificate(s) for the common stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), or any state securities laws. these shares have been acquired for investment and may not be sold or otherwise transferred in the absence of an effective registration statement for these shares under the securities act and applicable state securities laws, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the company that registration is not required and that an applicable exemption is available." purchaser has carefully read this letter and has discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon purchaser's resale of the common stock with purchaser's counsel. very truly yours, ------------------------------ by: ---------------------------- -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
