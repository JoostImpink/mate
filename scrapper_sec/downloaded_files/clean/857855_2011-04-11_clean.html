the making of any such payment in kind shall be at the option of the general partner after consultation with the withdrawing partner, and such payment in kind shall be made in the form of the withdrawing partner&#8217;s pro rata share of each investment of the partnership; provided that if such distribution in kind would be reasonably likely to cause the withdrawing limited partner or the partnership to suffer an adverse effect as a result of the application of law or, in the judgment of the general partner, cause the partnership to breach any contractual obligation of the partnership, the general partner or their respective affiliates, then such limited partner and the general partner shall each use its best efforts to make alternative arrangements for the sale or transfer into an escrow account of any such distribution on mutually agreeable terms; and provided , further , that a non-pro rata distribution in kind may be made with the consent of the withdrawing limited partner. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each limited partner shall be required to use its reasonable efforts to notify the general partner as soon as reasonably practicable after it comes to such limited partner&#8217;s attention that, by reason of a change in any law, regulation or governmental order to which such limited partner is subject occurring after its admission to the partnership, a violation of any such law, regulation or governmental order is likely to result without such limited partner&#8217;s withdrawal from the partnership. &#160;

(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the assets of the partnership at any time are &#8220;plan assets&#8221; for the purposes of erisa, the code or any applicable similar law, then each limited partner which is, directly or indirectly, an erisa partner or benefit plan partner subject to similar law or the fiduciary of an erisa partner or benefit plan partner subject to similar law shall, at the request of the general partner, identify to the general partner which of the persons on a list furnished by the general partner of persons with whom the partnership may have had non-exempt dealings are, to the best of its knowledge after due inquiry, parties in interest or disqualified persons (as defined in sections 3 of erisa and 4975 of the code, respectively or similar related parties under the applicable provision of any similar law) with respect to such erisa partner or benefit plan partner. &#160;

(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the provisions of sections 3.1(a), the obligation of partners to make capital contributions (i) for investments with respect to which the partnership (or the general partner or one or more of its affiliates on behalf of the partnership) has entered into a legally binding obligation to invest prior to an event of dissolution and (ii) the partnership&#8217;s obligations under any borrowings outstanding prior to an event of dissolution, shall survive such event of dissolution. &#160; 9.2.&#160;&#160; winding-up .&#160;&#160;upon the occurrence of an event of dissolution, the partnership shall be wound up and liquidated.&#160;&#160;the general partner or, if there is no general partner or the dissolution results from the occurrence of a disabling event, a liquidator appointed by a majority in interest of the limited partners, shall proceed with the dissolution sale and the final distribution.&#160;&#160;in the dissolution sale, the general partner or such liquidator shall use its reasonable best efforts to reduce to cash and cash equivalent items such assets of the partnership as the general partner or such liquidator shall deem it advisable to sell, subject to obtaining fair value for such assets and any tax, legal, contractual, market or other considerations (including legal restrictions on the ability of a limited partner to hold any assets to be distributed in kind), over such time as is reasonably necessary to settle gradually and close the partnership&#8217;s business under the circumstances then applicable to the partnership. &#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; 9.3.&#160;&#160; final distribution .&#160;&#160;after the dissolution sale, the proceeds thereof and the other assets of the partnership shall be distributed in one or more installments in the following order of priority: &#160;

and &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the remaining proceeds, if any, plus any remaining assets of the partnership, shall be applied and distributed to the partners in accordance with the positive balances of the partners&#8217;

provided that liquidating distributions shall be made in the same manner and amounts as distributions under section 3.2 if such distributions would result in the partners receiving a different amount than would have been received pursuant to a liquidating distribution based on capital account balances.&#160;&#160;for purposes of the application of this section 9.3 and determining capital accounts on liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued income and deductions of the partnership shall be treated as realized and recognized immediately before the date of distribution.&#160;&#160;if a limited partner shall, upon the advice of counsel, determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that any distribution in kind of an asset would cause such limited partner to be in violation of any law, regulation or governmental order, such limited partner and the general partner or the liquidator shall each use its best efforts to make alternative arrangements for the sale or transfer into an escrow account of any such distribution on mutually agreeable terms. &#160; article x &#160; capital accounts and allocations of profits and losses &#160; 10.1.&#160;&#160; capital accounts .&#160;&#160;a separate capital account (the &#8220; capital account &#8221;) shall be established and maintained for each partner.&#160;&#160;the capital account of each partner shall be credited with such partner&#8217;s capital contributions to the partnership, all profits allocated to such partner pursuant to section 10.2 and any items of income or gain which are specially allocated pursuant to section 10.3 or otherwise pursuant to this agreement; and shall be debited with all losses allocated to such partner pursuant to section 10.2, any items of loss or deduction of the partnership specially allocated to such partner pursuant to section 10.3 or otherwise pursuant to this agreement, and all cash and the carrying value of any property (net of liabilities assumed by such partner and the liabilities to which such property is subject) distributed by the partnership to such partner.&#160;&#160;to the extent not provided for in the preceding sentence, the capital accounts of the partners shall be adjusted and maintained in accordance with the rules of united states treasury regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), as the same may be amended or revised; provided that such adjustment and maintenance does not have a material adverse effect on the economic interests of the partners.&#160;&#160;any references in any section of this agreement to the capital account of a partner shall be deemed to refer to such capital account as the same may be credited or debited from time to time as set forth above.&#160;&#160;in the event of any transfer of any interest in the partnership in accordance with the terms of this agreement, the transferee shall succeed to the capital account of the transferor to the extent it relates to the transferred interest. &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; 10.2.&#160;&#160; allocations of profits and losses . &#160;&#160;except as otherwise provided herein, profits, losses and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the partnership shall be allocated among the capital accounts of the partners in a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the provisions of articles iii and ix and the other relevant provisions of this agreement. &#160; 10.3.&#160;&#160; special allocation provisions .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision in this article x: &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; minimum gain chargeback .&#160;&#160;if there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain or partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with the principles of united states treasury regulations sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any partnership taxable year, the partners shall be specially allocated items of partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to their respective shares of such net decrease during such year, determined pursuant to united states treasury regulations sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5).&#160;&#160;the items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with united states treasury regulations section&#160;1.704-2(f).&#160;&#160;this section 10.3(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements in such united states treasury regulations sections and shall be interpreted consistently therewith; including that no chargeback shall be required to the extent of the exceptions provided in united states treasury regulations sections 1.704-2(f) and 1.704-2(i)(4). &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; qualified income offset .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in united states treasury regulations sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such limited partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the deficit balance in his capital account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as promptly as possible. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; gross income allocation .&#160;&#160;in the event any limited partner has a deficit capital account at the end of any fiscal year which is in excess of the sum of (i) the amount such partner is obligated to restore, if any, pursuant to any provision of this agreement, and (ii)&#160;the amount such partner is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of united states treasury regulations sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such limited partner shall be specially allocated items of partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided that an allocation pursuant to this section 10.3(c) shall be made only if and to the extent that a limited partner would have a deficit capital account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this article x have been tentatively made as if section 10.3(b) and this section 10.3(c) were not in this agreement. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; general partner expenses .&#160;&#160;to the extent, if any, that general partner expenses and any items of loss, expense or deduction resulting therefrom are deemed to constitute items of partnership loss or deduction rather than items of loss or deduction of the general partner, such general partner expenses and other items of loss, expense or deduction shall be allocated 100% to the general partner. &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; payee allocation .&#160;&#160;in the event any payment to any person that is treated by the partnership as the payment of an expense is recharacterized by a taxing authority as a partnership distribution to the payee as a partner, such payee shall be specially allocated an amount of partnership gross income and gain as quickly as possible equal to the amount of the distribution. &#160; (f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse deductions shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective capital contributions. &#160; (g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; partner nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;partner nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the partner who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the liability to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with united states treasury regulations section 1.704-2(j). &#160; (h)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; special allocation .&#160;&#160;any special allocation of income or gain pursuant to section 10.3(b) or (c) hereof shall be taken into account in computing subsequent allocations pursuant to section 10.2 and this section 10.3(i), so that the net amount of any items so allocated and all other items allocated to each partner shall, to the extent possible, be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each partner if such allocations pursuant to section 10.3(b) or (c) had not occurred. &#160; 10.4.&#160;&#160; tax allocations .&#160;&#160;(a) for income tax purposes only, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as the corresponding items of profits and losses and specially allocated items are allocated for capital account purposes; provided that in the case of any partnership asset the carrying value of which differs from its adjusted tax basis for united states federal income tax purposes, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall be allocated solely for income tax purposes in accordance with the principles of sections 704(b) and (c) of the code (in any manner determined by the general partner) so as to take account of the difference between carrying value and adjusted basis of such asset.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, the general partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this agreement, taking into account such facts and circumstances as it deems reasonably necessary for this purpose; provided that all such allocations shall be made in a manner that, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, conforms to the economic terms contemplated by this agreement. &#160; 10.5.&#160;&#160; other allocation provisions .&#160;&#160;the foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this agreement relating to the maintenance of capital accounts are intended to comply with united states treasury regulations section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations.&#160;&#160;sections 10.2 to 10.5 may be amended at any time by the general partner if necessary to comply with such regulations or to ensure that allocations hereunder give economic effect to provisions of this agreement; provided that no such amendment shall materially affect the economic return of any partner without the prior written consent of such partner. &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; 10.6.&#160;&#160; tax advances .&#160;&#160;(a) to the extent the general partner reasonably determines that the partnership (or any entity in which the partnership holds an interest) is required by law to withhold or to make tax payments on behalf of or with respect to any partner (e.g., backup withholding taxes) (&#8220; tax advances &#8221;), the general partner may withhold or escrow such amounts and make such tax payments as so required.&#160;&#160;all tax advances made on behalf of a partner shall, at the option of the general partner, (i) be promptly paid to the partnership by the partner on whose behalf such tax advances were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to such partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds of liquidation of the partnership otherwise payable to such partner.&#160;&#160;whenever the general partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of a tax advance by a partner, for all other purposes of this agreement such partner shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon liquidation of the partnership) unreduced by the amount of such tax advance.&#160;&#160;to the fullest extent permitted by law, each partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the partnership and the other partners from and against any liability (including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such partner.&#160;&#160;in the event the partnership is liquidated and a liability is asserted by a governmental authority against the general partner or any member or officer of the general partner for tax advances made or required to be made, the general partner shall have the right to be reimbursed from the limited partner on whose behalf such tax advance was made or required to be made. &#160; article xi &#160; miscellaneous &#160; 11.1.&#160;&#160; waiver of accounting and partition .&#160;&#160;except as may be otherwise required by law, each partner hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for an accounting or for partition or similar action of any of the partnership&#8217;s property. &#160; 11.2.&#160;&#160; power of attorney .&#160;&#160;each limited partner hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the general partner, with full power of substitution, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent of such limited partner, to execute, acknowledge, verify, swear to, deliver, record and file, in its or its assignee&#8217;s name, place and stead, all in accordance with the terms of this agreement, all instruments, documents and certificates which may from time to time be required by the laws of the united states of america, the state of delaware, any other jurisdiction in which the partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, or any political subdivision or agency thereof to effectuate, implement and continue the valid existence and affairs of the partnership, including, without limitation, the power and authority to verify, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, record and file: &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;all certificates and other instruments, including any amendments to this agreement or to the certificate of limited partnership, which the general partner deems appropriate to form, qualify or continue the partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability) in the state of delaware and all other jurisdictions in which the partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;any amendments to this agreement or any other agreement or instrument which the general partner deems appropriate to (i) effect the addition, substitution or removal of any limited partner or general partner pursuant to this agreement or (ii) effect any other amendment or modification to this agreement, but only if such amendment or modification is duly adopted in accordance with the terms hereof, &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;all conveyances and other instruments which the general partner deems appropriate to reflect the dissolution, winding up and termination of the partnership pursuant to the terms hereof or applicable law, including the writing required by the act to cancel the certificate of limited partnership, &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;all instruments relating to transfers of interests of limited partners or to the admission of any substitute limited partner, including executing transfer documents on behalf of a defaulting limited partner pursuant to section 8.3, &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;certificates of assumed name and such other certificates and instruments as may be necessary under the fictitious or assumed name statutes from time to time in effect in the state of delaware and all other jurisdictions in which the partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, &#160; such attorney-in-fact and agent shall not, however, have the right, power or authority to amend or modify this agreement when acting in such capacities, except to the extent authorized herein.&#160;&#160;this power of attorney shall terminate upon the bankruptcy, dissolution, disability or incompetence of the general partner or upon the removal of the general partner as general partner of the partnership pursuant to section 8.1(b).&#160;&#160;the power of attorney granted herein shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable, shall survive and not be affected by the subsequent dissolution, bankruptcy, incapacity or legal disability of the limited partner and shall extend to its successors and assigns; and may be exercisable by such attorney-in-fact and agent for all limited partners (or any of them) required to execute any such instrument, and executing such instrument acting as attorney-in-fact with or without listing all of the limited partners executing an instrument.&#160;&#160;any person dealing with the partnership may conclusively presume and rely upon the fact that any instrument referred to above, executed by such attorney-in-fact and agent, is authorized, regular and binding, without further inquiry.&#160;&#160;if required, each limited partner shall execute and deliver to the general partner within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt of a request therefor, such further designations, powers of attorney or other instruments as the general partner shall reasonably deem necessary for the purposes hereof.&#160;&#160;the general partner agrees that it will not exercise the power of attorney granted herein with respect to a limited partner if such limited partner has notified the general partner in writing that such exercise would contravene any federal, state or local law to which such limited partner is or may become subject. &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; 11.3.&#160;&#160; amendments .&#160;&#160;(a)&#160;&#160;except as required by law, this agreement may be amended or supplemented by the written consent of the general partner and a majority in interest of the limited partners; provided that no such amendment shall: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;increase any limited partner&#8217;s capital commitment, reduce its share of the partnership&#8217;s distributions, income and gains, increase its share of the partnership&#8217;s losses, or adversely affect the limited liability of such limited partner without the written consent of each limited partner so affected, &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;change the percentage of interests of limited partners (the &#8220; required interest &#8221;) necessary for any consent required hereunder to the taking of an action in a manner adverse to the limited partners, unless such amendment is approved by limited partners who then hold interests equal to or in excess of the required interest for the subject of such proposed amendment, or &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;amend this section 11.3 in a manner adverse to any limited partner without the consent of each such limited partner. &#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to clauses (i) through (vii) of the proviso to the preceding sentence, this agreement may be amended by the general partner without the consent of the limited partners to (v) change the name of the partnership pursuant to section 2.2, (w) cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any provision hereof which is incomplete or inconsistent with any other provision hereof or correct any printing, stenographic or clerical error or omission; provided that such amendment does not adversely affect the interests of any of the limited partners, (x) amend sections 10.2 to 10.5 pursuant to section 10.5, and (y) make any amendment so long as the changes do not adversely affect the rights and obligations of any existing limited partner as a whole in any material respect and the amendment is not objected to in writing by any limited partner within twenty business days after notice of such amendment is given to all limited partners. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the general partner shall have the right to amend this agreement without the approval of any other partner to the extent the general partner reasonably determines, based upon written advice of tax counsel to the partnership, that the amendment is necessary to provide assurance that the partnership will not be treated as a &#8220;publicly traded partnership&#8221;; provided that (i) such amendment shall not change the relative economic interests of the partners, reduce any partner&#8217;s share of distributions, or increase any partner&#8217;s capital commitment or its liability hereunder and (ii) the general partner provides a copy of such written advice and amendment to the limited partners at least twenty (20) business days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and a majority in interest of the limited partners shall not have made a reasonable objection to such amendment prior to the effective date of such amendment. &#160;
