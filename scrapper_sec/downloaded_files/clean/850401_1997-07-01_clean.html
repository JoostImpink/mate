(ii) any indemnified party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (i) of this section 8(j) upon learning of any such claim, shall promptly notify parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve parent of any liability it may have to such indemnified party if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party. in the event of any such claim (whether arising before or after the merger 1 effective time or the merger 3 effective time, as the case may be), (a) parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and parent shall not be liable to such indemnified parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if parent elects not to assume such defense, the indemnified parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to parent, and parent shall pay reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties; provided, however, that parent shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (ii) to pay for only one firm or counsel for all indemnified parties unless the use of one counsel for such indemnified parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (b) the indemnified parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (c) parent shall not be 45 liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, however, that parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any indemnified party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such indemnified party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. if such indemnity is not available with respect to any indemnified party, then parent and the indemnified party shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits, with any respect of "fault" otherwise allocable to a seller being allocated to parent. (iii) for a period of six years after the merger 1 effective time and the merger 3 effective time, respectively, purchasers shall maintain the sellers' existing directors and officers liability insurance or equivalent liability insurance, which will provide coverage for those persons who are directors and officers of the sellers as of such effective time, so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by the sellers prior to the date hereof. (iv) in lieu of the insurance arrangement referred to in clause (iii) of this section 8(j), purchasers may, on or before the closing, enter into alternative insurance arrangements, providing that such arrangements are approved by each of the sellers and are no less advantageous to the indemnified parties so long as no lapse in coverage occurs as a result of such substitution.

(iii) agreement to vote shares. unless this merger agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, at every meeting of the stockholders of convest held prior to the merger 3 effective time called with respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of convest with respect to any of the following, edisto shall vote the shares and any new shares; (a) in favor of approval of this agreement, the merger 3 articles and the mergers and any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the mergers; and (b) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to the consummation of the mergers, this agreement or the merger 3 articles, against any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization or recapitalization with any party other than parent and its affiliates and against any liquidation or winding up of convest (each of the foregoing is referred to as an "opposing proposal"). to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement. edisto hereby revokes any and all proxies with respect to the shares or any other voting securities of convest.

capital stock of edisto or convest that stockholders purchase or with respect to which stockholders otherwise acquire beneficial ownership after the date of this agreement and prior to the expiration

stockholders' vote or action by written consent of edisto or convest stockholders with respect to an opposing proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement with any third party substantially similar to

receivables, right of offset, lawsuits or any other claim whatsoever, whether contingent or otherwise, against either edisto or convest or any of their respective subsidiaries, officers, directors or employees. 5. registration rights. 5.1 shelf registration. within 120 days of the effective date of the mergers, forcenergy shall file a "shelf" registration statement to register under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the"securities act") the sale from time to time of the shares of stock and use reasonable efforts to obtain the effectiveness of such registration statement within 180 days of the effective date of the mergers; provided, however, that forcenergy may defer its obligations under this section 5.1 for a period of no more than 30 days if forcenergy would be required to prepare financial statements other than those it customarily prepares or forcenergy determines in its reasonable judgment that the registration and offering would have a material adverse effect on any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material corporate transaction or development involving forcenergy that is pending at the time and promptly gives stockholder notice of that determination (it being understood, however, that, in any such event, forcenergy shall use all reasonable efforts to minimize the length of the postponement). the provisions of this section 5.1 are subject to the provisions of section 5.4. in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any prospectus or suspending the qualification of such shares of stock for sale in any jurisdiction, forcenergy shall use its reasonable efforts promptly to obtain its withdrawal. 5.2 piggyback registration rights. subject to the provisions of section 5.4, if forcenergy at any time proposes to register any of its common stock under the securities act (other than registrations on forms s-4 or s-8 or any successor forms thereof or registrations of securities in connection with a rule 145 transaction), whether of its own accord or at the request of any holder or holders of its securities, it shall at such time promptly after the receipt of a request from holder(s) of its securities or its own decision to initiate a registration (but no later than ten business days) give written notice to the stockholder of its intention to do so. upon the written request of the stockholders delivered to forcenergy within ten business days after receipt of any such notice, forcenergy shall use reasonable efforts (subject to the provisions of this section 5.2) to cause all shares of stock, which stockholders shall have so requested registration thereof, to be registered under the securities act, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or other disposition by the stockholder of such shares of stock; provided, however, forcenergy may elect not to file a registration statement pursuant to this section 5.2 or may -4- withdraw any registration statement filed pursuant to this section 5.2 at any time prior to the effective date hereof. if the managing underwriter for the offering advises that marketing factors require the inclusion in such registration of some or all of the shares of stock sought to be registered by the stockholders to be limited or that the number of securities to be registered at the insistence of forcenergy and any other selling shareholders plus the number of shares of stock sought to be registered by the stockholders should be limited due to marketing factors, the number of shares of stock sought to be registered by the stockholders and such other selling shareholders shall be reduced pro rata, based on the number of securities sought to be registered by each stockholder, forcenergy or such other selling shareholder, to the number recommended by the managing underwriter. in connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares being issued by forcenergy, forcenergy shall not be required to include any of the shares of stock in such underwriting pursuant to section 5.2 unless the stockholder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between forcenergy and the underwriters. the shares of stock proposed to be registered under any registration statement under section 5.2 hereof shall be offered for sale at the same public offering price as the shares of common stock of forcenergy offered for sale by forcenergy or any other selling shareholder covered thereby. 5.3 expenses of registration. all expenses incurred in connection with the registrations of shares of stock pursuant to this article 5, including without limitation (i) all state registration and qualification fees, (ii) all printing, engineering and accounting fees, (iii) one half of the securities and exchange commission registration fee, the fee payable to the national association of securities dealers, inc. and (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for forcenergy, shall be borne by forcenergy; provided, however, that forcenergy shall not be required to pay, and the stockholder shall pay, any underwriter discounts, commissions, and other underwriter compensation, to the extent such fees, discounts, commissions and compensation relate to the shares of stock. 5.4 termination. forcenergy shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement contemplated by section 5.1 following the expiration of one year from the effective date of the mergers and may de-register any shares of stock covered by such registration statement after such time. in addition, forcenergy shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to section 5.2, and the provisions contained in section 5.2 shall terminate and be of no force and effect, following the expiration of one year from the effective date of the mergers. 6. termination. other than with respect to the provisions of section 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 and the provisions of article 5, which provisions shall survive any termination of this agreement, this agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the expiration date. -5- 7. miscellaneous. 7.1 severability. if any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 7.2 binding effect and assignment. this agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties without the prior written consent of the other, except the rights under article 5 may be assigned if stockholder sells all of its shares in a private transaction which complies with the terms of this agreement. 7.3 amendments and modification. this agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. 7.4 specific performance; injunctive relief. the parties acknowledge that forcenergy will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of stockholder set forth herein. therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available to forcenergy upon any such violation, forcenergy shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to forcenergy at law or in equity.
