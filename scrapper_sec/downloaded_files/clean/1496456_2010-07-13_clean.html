dividends .&#160;&#160;the holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive cash dividends, payable at such times and in such amounts as is set forth below: (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;quarterly, on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the corporation, out of funds legally available therefor, the regular quarterly dividend, until the aggregate contingent dividends paid pursuant to paragraph 1(b) below equals the contingent dividend cap; and (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;quarterly, on or before the contingent dividend payment date, out of funds legally available therefor, in the amount of the contingent dividend determined as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter of the corporation (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending october 31, 2010), paid ratably to each holder of series a preferred stock in proportion to the number of shares of series a preferred stock held by each, until the aggregate contingent dividends paid pursuant to this paragraph 1(b) equals the contingent dividend cap. no dividends shall be paid with respect to any shares of common stock or any junior stock unless the holders of series a preferred stock are first paid (i) all due and unpaid dividends and (ii) a dividend per share of series a preferred stock equal to the dividend which would be payable on the number of shares of common stock into which each share of series a preferred stock is then convertible. &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; liquidation .&#160;&#160;in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, before any distribution or payment is made to the holders of common stock or any junior stock.&#160;&#160;if, upon any such sale, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets distributable among the holders of all series a preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to such holders of the amount hereinabove provided, then the entire assets of the corporation shall be applied ratably to the payment of such amount to the holders of series a preferred stock then outstanding.&#160;&#160;thereafter, any remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock and holders of series a preferred stock (as if all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted into common stock).&#160;&#160;the merger or consolidation of the corporation, the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance of more than 50% of the corporation&#8217;s assets or the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance of assets which generated more than 50% of the corporation&#8217;s revenues for its then current fiscal year or for the fiscal year immediately prior thereto, shall each be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of this paragraph 2 if the holders of a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock outstanding so determine by notice to the corporation no later than ten days after the occurrence thereof.&#160;&#160;the holders of series a preferred stock shall be given notice of any proposed transaction set forth in this paragraph 2 at least 20 days prior to the approval thereof. 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

conversion price &#8221;).&#160;&#160;the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each share of series a preferred stock (the &#8220; conversion rate &#8221;) shall be equal to the original purchase price divided by the conversion price.&#160;&#160;to the extent permitted by law, when shares of series a preferred stock are converted, all dividends accrued and unpaid on the stock so converted to the date of conversion (whether or not currently payable) shall be immediately due and payable in cash. 3.2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) hereof, the issued and outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be automatically converted into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at the conversion price upon the consent of clipper as long as it holds a majority of the series a preferred stock. 3.5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the issuance of certificates for shares of common stock upon the conversion of shares of series a preferred stock shall be made without charge to the converting stockholder for any original issue or transfer tax in respect of the issuance of such certificates and any such tax shall be paid by the corporation. 3.6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the conversion price shall be subject to the following adjustments: 3.6.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the corporation shall declare and pay to the holders of common stock a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holders of series a preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive after the declaration and payment of such dividend or other distribution if such shares of series a preferred stock had been converted immediately prior to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution. 3.6.2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the corporation shall subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares of common stock, or combine the outstanding shares of common stock into a lesser number of shares, or issue by reclassification of its shares of common stock any shares of the corporation, the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holders of series a preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above if such shares of series a preferred stock had been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event on the day upon which such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as the case may be, becomes effective. &#160; 3 &#160; 3.6.3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if, after the date of issuance of the series a preferred stock, the corporation shall issue or sell any additional shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then, and thereafter successively upon any such issuance or sale, the conversion price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the outstanding series a preferred stock (based on the conversion price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to this adjustment) plus the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration&#160;&#160;received by the corporation for the total number of additional shares of common stock so issued would purchase at the conversion price in effect prior to such issue; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the outstanding series a preferred stock (based on the conversion price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to this adjustment) plus the number of such additional shares of common stock so issued.&#160;&#160;for the purposes of this subparagraph 3.6.3, the date as of which the conversion price shall be computed shall be the earlier of (x) the date on which the corporation shall enter into a firm contract for the issuance or sale of such additional shares of common stock or (y) the date of the actual issuance or sale of such shares. 3.6.4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the corporation shall issue or sell any warrants or options or other rights entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase either any additional shares of common stock or evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which are convertible into or exchangeable, with or without payment of additional consideration in cash or property, for additional shares of common stock (such convertible or exchangeable evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities hereinafter being called &#8220; convertible securities &#8221;), and the consideration per share for which additional shares of common stock may at any time thereafter be issuable pursuant to such warrants, options or other rights or pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities (when added to the consideration per share of common stock, if any, received for such warrants, options or other rights), shall be less than the conversion price, then the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subparagraph 3.6.3 on the basis of the consideration received and receivable by the corporation for the issuance of such additional shares of common stock pursuant to such warrants, options or other rights or pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities. 3.6.5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the corporation shall issue or sell convertible securities and the consideration per share for which additional shares of common stock may at any time thereafter be issuable pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities shall be less than the conversion price, then the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subparagraph 3.6.3 on the basis that the aggregate consideration for such maximum number of additional shares of common stock shall be deemed to be the consideration received and receivable by the corporation for the issuance of such additional shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities.&#160;&#160;no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made under this subparagraph (v) upon the issuance of any convertible securities which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants, options or other rights, if such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants, options or other rights pursuant to subparagraph 3.6.4. &#160; 4 &#160; 3.6.6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for the purposes of subparagraphs 3.6.4 and 3.6.5, the date as of which the conversion price shall be computed shall be the earliest of (x) the date on which the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive any warrants, options or other rights referred to in subsection 3.6.4 or to receive any convertible securities, (y) the date on which the corporation shall enter into a firm contract for the issuance of such warrants, options or other rights or convertible securities or (z) the date of the actual issuance of such warrants, options or other rights or convertible securities. 3.6.7&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made under subparagraph 3.6.3 upon the issuance of any additional shares of common stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants, options or other rights or pursuant to the exercise of any conversion or exchange rights in any convertible securities, if such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants, options or other rights or upon the issuance of such convertible securities (or upon the issuance of any warrants, options or other rights therefor), pursuant to subparagraphs 3.6.4 or 3.6.5. 3.6.8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if any warrants, options or other rights (or any portions thereof) which shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to subparagraph 3.6.4 or conversion rights pursuant to convertible securities which shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to subparagraph 3.6.5 shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or if by reason of the terms of such warrants, options or other rights or convertible securities there shall have been an increase or increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the exercise or conversion thereof, then the conversion price shall be readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of (x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of common stock corresponding to such warrants, options or other rights or conversion rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional shares of common stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of such warrants, options or other rights or of conversion rights pursuant to any convertible securities as having been issued for the consideration actually received and receivable thereof, and (z) treating any of such warrants, options or other rights or of conversion rights pursuant to any convertible securities which remain outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time; provided, however, that any consideration which was actually received by the corporation in connection with the issuance or sale of such warrants, options or other rights shall form part of the readjustment computation even though such warrants, options or other rights shall have expired without the exercise thereof.&#160;&#160;the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in subparagraph 3.6.3 as a result of any increase in the number of additional shares of common stock issuable, or any decrease in the consideration payable upon any issuance of additional shares of common stock, pursuant to any anti-dilution provisions contained in any warrants, options or other rights or in any convertible securities. 3.6.9&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in case any additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or warrants, options or other rights to purchase any such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received thereof or shall be deemed to be the amount received by the corporation therefor. &#160;

(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in any such case covered by subparagraphs (a) or (b) herein, in determining the amount of consideration received by the corporation, if the consideration is in whole or in part consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation.&#160;&#160;if additional shares of common stock shall be issued as part of a unit with warrants, options, or other rights, then the amount of consideration for the warrants, option or other right shall be deemed to be the amount determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors of the corporation.&#160;&#160;if the board of directors of the corporation shall not make any such determination, the consideration for the warrant, option or other right shall be deemed to be zero. (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in any such case covered by subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) (d) herein, in determining the amount of consideration received by the corporation (i) any amounts paid or receivable for accrued interest or accrued dividends shall be excluded, and (ii) any compensation, discounts, or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith shall not be deducted.
