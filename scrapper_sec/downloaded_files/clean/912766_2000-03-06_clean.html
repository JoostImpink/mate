(b) with respect to the holders of senior indebtedness, the trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants or obligations as are specifically set forth in this article xii and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to holders of senior indebtedness shall be read into this indenture as against the trustee. article xiii. conversion of securities section 13.1. conversion privilege. -------------------- subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this article xiii, at the option of the holder thereof, any security may at any time, be converted, in whole, or in part in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the securities, at the conversion price in effect at the date of conversion, until and including, but not after the close of business on the stated maturity, unless such security or some portion thereof shall have been called for redemption or delivered for repurchase prior to such date and no default is made in making due provision for the payment of the redemption price in accordance with the terms of this indenture, in which case, with respect to such security or portion thereof as has been so called for redemption or delivered for repurchase, such security or portion thereof may be so converted until and including, but not after, the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the redemption date or repurchase date, as applicable, for such security, unless the company subsequently fails to pay the applicable redemption price or repurchase price, as the case may be. section 13.2. exercise of conversion privilege. -------------------------------- (a) in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of any security to be converted shall surrender such security to the company at any time during usual business hours at its office or agency maintained for the purpose as provided in this indenture, accompanied by a fully executed written notice, in substantially the form set forth on the reverse of the security, that the holder elects to convert such security or a stated portion thereof constituting a multiple of $1,000 principal amount. interest payable in respect of a security surrendered for conversion on or after an interest payment date shall be paid to the holder of such security as of the next preceding record date, notwithstanding the exercise of the right of conversion. such notice of conversion shall also state the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issued. (b) securities surrendered for conversion shall (if reasonably required by the company or the trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the company duly executed by, the holder or his attorney duly 51 authorized in writing, with appropriate signature guarantee. as promptly as practicable after the receipt of such notice and the surrender of such security as aforesaid, the company shall, subject to the provisions of section 13.8 hereof, issue and deliver at such office or agency to such holder, or on his written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock issuable on such conversion of securities in accordance with the provisions of this article xiii and cash, as provided in section 13.3 hereof, in respect of any fraction of a share of common stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion. such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date (herein called the "date of conversion") on which such ------------------ security shall have been surrendered as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of common stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on the date of conversion the holder or holders of record of the shares represented thereby; provided, however, that any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed shall cause the person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for such shares are to be issued to be deemed to have become the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the opening of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open but such conversion shall nevertheless be at the conversion price in effect at the close of business on the date when such security shall have been so surrendered with the conversion notice. in the case of conversion of a portion, but less than all, of a security, the company shall as promptly as practicable execute, and the trustee shall thereafter authenticate and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the company, a security or securities in the aggregate principal amount of the unconverted portion of the security surrendered. except as otherwise expressly provided in this indenture, no payment or adjustment shall be made for interest accrued on any security (or portion thereof) converted or for dividends or distributions on any common stock issued upon conversion of any security. section 13.3. fractional interests. -------------------- no fractions of shares of common stock or scrip representing fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of securities. if more than one security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of common stock which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the securities so surrendered. if any fraction of a share of common stock would, except for the foregoing provisions of this section 13.3, be issuable on the conversion of any security or securities, the company shall make payment in lieu thereof in an amount of cash equal to the value of such fraction computed on the basis of the last sale price of the common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market (or if not listed for trading thereon, then on the principal national securities exchange or on the principal automated quotation system on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading) at the close of business on the date of conversion or if no such sale takes place on such day, the last sale price for such day shall be the average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way on the nasdaq national market (or if not listed for trading thereon, on the principal national securities exchange or on the principal automated quotation system on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading) for such day (any such last sale price being hereinafter referred to as the "last sale price"). if on the date of conversion, the common --------------- stock is not quoted by any such organization, the fair value of such common stock on such day, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, shall be used. section 13.4. conversion price. ---------------- the conversion price per share of common stock issuable upon conversion of the securities (as such price may be adjusted, herein called the "conversion ---------- price") shall initially be $15.735 (which reflects a conversion rate of 63.5526 - ----- shares of common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of securities). 52 section 13.5. adjustment of conversion price. ------------------------------ the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) in case there shall be made or paid a dividend or made a distribution in shares of common stock on any class of capital stock of the company, the conversion price in effect immediately following the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on such date and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution. an adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subsection (i) and (j) below, after such record date. (b) in case the company shall (1) subdivide or reclassify its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares or (2) combine or reclassify its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately following the effectiveness of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination and the denominator shall be the number of shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or reclassification. an adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (b) shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subsection (i) and (j) below, after the effective date of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (c) in case there shall be an issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all holders of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the then current market price per share of the common stock (as determined pursuant to subsection (g) below) on the record date fixed for determination of the shareholders entitled to receive such rights, option or warrants, the conversion price in effect immediately following such record date shall be adjusted to a price, computed to the nearest cent, so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction, of which: (i) the numerator shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date plus (b) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price (determined by multiplying such total number of shares of common stock by the exercise price of such rights, options or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such current market price), and of which (ii) the denominator shall be (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date plus (b) the number of additional shares of common stock which are so offered for subscription or purchase. such adjustment shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subsection (i) and (j) below, after the record date for the determination of holders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants; provided, however, that if any such rights, options or warrants issued by the company as described in this subsection (c) are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then the conversion price will not be adjusted as provided in this subsection (c) 53 until such triggering events occur. upon the expiration or termination of any rights, options or warrants without the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, the conversion price then in effect shall be adjusted immediately to the conversion price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such rights, options or warrants, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. (d) in case there shall be a distribution to all or substantially all holders of common stock, of any assets, evidences of indebtedness, cash or securities, including without limitation any distribution of any securities of the incubator (other than (x) any dividend or distribution for which an adjustment is required to be made in accordance with subsection (a) or (c) above and in mergers and consolidations to which section 13.6 applies, or (y) any distribution of rights or warrants subject to subsection (1) below or any distribution in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) then in each such case the conversion price in effect immediately following the record date fixed for the determination of the shareholders entitled to such distribution shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the then current market price per share of the common stock (determined as provided in subsection (g) below) on such record date less the then fair market value (as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company) of the portion of the assets so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and of which the denominator shall be such current market price per share of the common stock (determined as provided in subsection (g) below). such adjustment shall become effective immediately, except as provided in subsection (j) below, after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. (e) [intentionally omitted] (f) in case the company or any subsidiary of the company shall complete a tender offer for all or any portion of the common stock (any such tender offer being referred to as an "offer") that involves an aggregate consideration having a fair market value as of the expiration of such offer (the "expiration time") that, together with (i) any cash and the fair market value of any other consideration payable in respect of any other tender offer, as of the expiration of such other tender offer, expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such offer and in respect of which no conversion price adjustment pursuant to this subsection (f) has been made and (ii) the aggregate amount of any all-cash distributions referred to in subsection (e) of this section 13.5 to all holders of common stock within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such offer for which no conversion price adjustment pursuant to such subsection (e) has been made, exceeds 15.0% of the product of the then current market price per share (determined as provided in subsection (g) below) of the common stock at the expiration time times the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time, the conversion price in effect immediately following such expiration time shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of the then current market price per share (determined as provided in subsection (g) below) of the common stock at the expiration time times the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the expiration time minus (ii) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time (the shares deemed so accepted being referred to as the "purchased shares") and the denominator shall be the product of (i) such current market price per share at the expiration time times (ii) such number of outstanding shares at the expiration time less the number of purchased shares, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. (g) for the purpose of any computation under subsections (c), (d) and (f) above, the 54 current market price per share of common stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the last sale prices of a share of common stock for the five consecutive trading days selected by the company commencing not more than 20 trading days before, and ending not later than, the earlier of the date in question and the date before the "'ex' date," with respect to the issuance, distribution or offer requiring such computation. if on any such trading day the common stock is not quoted by any organization referred to in the definition of last sale price in section 13.3 hereof, the fair value of the common stock on such day, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, shall be used. for purposes of this paragraph, the term "'ex' date," when used with respect to any issuance, distribution or payments with respect to an offer, means the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the nasdaq national market (or if not listed or admitted to trading thereon, then on the principal national securities exchange or the principal automated quotation system if the common stock is listed or admitted to trading thereon) without the right to receive such issuance, distribution or offer. (h) in addition to the foregoing adjustments in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) above, the company, from time to time and to the extent permitted by law, may reduce the conversion price by any amount for at least 20 business days, if the board of directors has made a determination, which determination shall be conclusive, that such reduction would be in the best interests of the company. the company shall give notice to the trustee and cause notice of such reduction to be mailed to each holder of securities at such holder's address as the same appears on the registry books of the registrar, at least 15 days prior to the date on which such reduction commences. the company may, at its option, also make such reductions in the conversion price in addition to those set forth above, as the board of directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of shares of common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for united states federal income tax purposes. (i) [intentionally omitted] (j) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the conversion price; provided that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (j) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this article xiii shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one- hundredth of a share, as the case may be. in no event shall the conversion price be less than the par value of a share of the company's common stock. (k) whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall promptly (i) file with the trustee and each conversion agent an officers' certificate setting forth the conversion price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment, and (ii) mail or cause to be mailed a notice of such adjustment to each holder of securities at such holder's address as the same appears on the registry books of the registrar. unless and until a trust officer has received an officers' certificate setting forth an adjustment of the conversion price, the trustee may assume that no such adjustment has been made and that the last conversion price for which the trustee has received an officers' certificate is the current conversion price. neither the trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such officer's certificate or the information and calculation contained therein, except to exhibit the same to any holder deserving inspection thereof, at its office during normal business hours. (l) in the event that the company distributes rights or warrants (other than those referred to in subsection (c) above) pro rata to holders --- ---- of common stock, so long as any such rights 55 or warrants have not expired or been redeemed by the company, instead of making an adjustment in the conversion price, the company may make proper provision so that the holder of any security surrendered for conversion will be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion (the "conversion shares"), a number of rights or warrants to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the distribution to the holders of rights or warrants of separate certificates evidencing such rights or warrants (the "distribution date"), the same number of rights or warrants to which a holder of a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of conversion shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the rights or warrants, and (ii) if such conversion occurs after such distribution date, the same number of rights or warrants to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which the principal amount of such security so converted was convertible immediately prior to such distribution date would have been entitled on such distribution date in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the rights or warrants. section 13.6. continuation of conversion privilege in case of ----------------------------------------------- reclassification, change, merger, consolidation or sale of assets. - ----------------------------------------------------------------- if there shall occur: (a) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value, to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (b) any consolidation or merger of the company with or into any other person, or the consolidation or merger of any other person with or into the company (other than a merger which does not result in any reclassification, change, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of common stock) or (c) any sale, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the company (computed on a consolidated basis), then the company, or such successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, execute and deliver to the trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the holder of each security then outstanding shall have the right to convert such security only into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of such security immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance assuming such holder of common stock of the company failed to exercise his rights of an election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash, and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance is not the same for each share of common stock of the company held immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this section 13.6 the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or conveyance by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this article xiii. if, in the case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, the stock or other securities and property (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of shares of common 56 stock includes shares of stock or other securities and property (including cash) of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the securities as the board of directors of the company shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing. the provisions of this section 13.6 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances. notice of the execution of each such supplemental indenture shall be mailed to each holder of securities at such holder's address as the same appears on the registry books of the registrar. section 13.7. notice of certain events. ------------------------ in case: (a) the company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) payable to the holders of common stock (other than cash dividends); (b) the company shall authorize the granting to all or substantially all the holders of common stock of rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or of any other rights; (c) the company shall authorize any reclassification or change of the common stock (including a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of common stock), or any consolidation or merger to which the company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the company is required, or the sale or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the company; (d) there shall be proposed any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company; or (e) the company or any of its subsidiaries shall complete an offer, as defined in section 13.5; then, the company shall cause to be filed at the office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the securities as provided in section 13.2 hereof, and shall cause to be mailed to each holder of securities, at such holder's address as it shall appear on the registry books of the registrar, at least 10 days before the date hereinafter specified (or the earlier of the dates hereinafter specified, in the event that more than one date is specified), a notice stating the date on which (1) a record is expected to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights, warrants or options or offer, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights, warrants or options or to participate in such offer are to be determined, or (2) such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. section 13.8. taxes on conversion. ------------------- the company will pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable to the united states of america or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of securities pursuant thereto; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved 57 in the issue or delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that of the holder of the securities to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the company, that such tax has been paid. the company extends no protection with respect to any other taxes imposed in connection with conversion of securities. section 13.9. company to provide stock. ------------------------ (a) the company shall reserve, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, sufficient shares of common stock to provide for the conversion of the securities from time to time as such securities are presented for conversion, provided that nothing contained in this section 13.9 shall be construed to preclude the company from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of securities by delivery of repurchased shares of common stock which are held in the treasury of the company. (b) if any shares of common stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, then the company covenants that it will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible use its reasonable efforts to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be, provided, however, that nothing in this section 13.9 shall be deemed to limit in any way the obligations of the company provided in this article xiii. (c) before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value, if any, of the common stock, the company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of counsel, be necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at such adjusted conversion price. (d) the company covenants that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of securities will upon issue be fully paid and non-assessable by the company and free of preemptive rights. section 13.10. disclaimer of responsibility for certain matters. ------------------------------------------------ neither the trustee nor any agent of the trustee shall at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the conversion price, or with respect to the officers' certificate referred to in section 13.5 hereof, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. neither the trustee nor any agent of the trustee shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of common stock, or of any securities or property (including cash), which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any security; and neither the trustee nor any conversion agent makes any representation with respect thereto. neither the trustee nor any agent of the trustee shall be responsible for any failure of the company to issue, register the transfer of or deliver any shares of common stock or stock certificates or other securities or property (including cash) upon the surrender of any security for the purpose of conversion or, subject to article viii hereof, to comply with any of the covenants of the company contained in this article xiii. 58 section 13.11. return of funds deposited for redemption of converted ----------------------------------------------------- securities. ---------- any funds which at any time shall have been deposited by the company or on its behalf with the trustee or any other paying agent for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on any of the securities and which shall not be required for such purposes because of the conversion of such securities, as provided in this article xiii, shall promptly after such conversion be repaid to the company by the trustee or such other paying agent in accordance with the company's written instructions. article xiv. miscellaneous section 14.1. tia controls. ------------ if any provision of this indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of the tia, the imposed duties, regardless of whether this indenture has been qualified under the tia, shall control. if any provision of this indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the tia that may be so modified or excluded, then the applicable tia provision shall be deemed to apply to this indenture as so modified, or shall be excluded, as the case may be. section 14.2. notices. ------- (a) any notices or other communications to the company or the trustee required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be sufficiently given if made by hand delivery, by recognized overnight courier, by telecopier or registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed as follows: if to the company: sylvan learning systems, inc. 1000 lancaster street baltimore, maryland 21202 attention: chief financial officer telephone: (410) 843-8000 telecopy: (410) 843-8065 if to the trustee: [name and address to come] attention: [ ] telephone: ([___]) [___]-[____] telecopy: ([___]) [___]-[____] (b) any party by notice to each other party may designate additional or different addresses as shall be furnished in writing by such party. any notice or communication to any party shall be deemed to have been given or made as of the date so delivered, if personally delivered; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; the next business day after delivery to an overnight courier; and five business days after mailing if sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid (except that a notice of change of address shall not be deemed to have been given until actually received by 59 the addressee).

(b) each holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the company and its directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20 of the exchange act) the company, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company set forth in section 7(a) above, but only with reference to information relating to such holder furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use in any registration statement. in no event shall any holder, its directors, its officers or any person, if any, who controls such holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 11 (c) in case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 7(a) or 7(b) (the "indemnified party"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the ----------------- person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying ------------ person") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of ------ such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both sections 7(a) and 7(b), a holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this section 7(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the holder). any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). in any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to section 7(a), and by the company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to section 7(b). the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than twenty business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a bona fide request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) to the extent that the indemnification provided for in this section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and the holders, on the other hand, from their sale of transfer restricted securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the company on the one hand, and of the holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and of the holders, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company, on the one hand, or by the holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the section 7(b), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. the company and each holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 7, no holder or its related indemnified holders shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such holder with respect to the sale of its transfer restricted securities pursuant to a registration statement exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section 7(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of transfer restricted securities held by each of the holders hereunder and not joint. section 8.

(b) no inconsistent agreements. the company will not, on or -------------------------- after the date of this agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. the company has not previously entered into any agreement (which has not expired or been terminated) granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any person. the rights granted to the holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the company's securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
