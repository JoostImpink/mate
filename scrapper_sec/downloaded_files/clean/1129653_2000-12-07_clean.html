any delay in his providing notice shall extend the deadline for the filing of the registration by the number of days after february 15, 2001 that dunavant delays providing this notice. (ii) notwithstanding any other provisions of this amended agreement, hsns shall use its best efforts to obtain a written legal opinion from an attorney from a nationally-recognized law firm who is reasonably experienced in handling sec matters and who is reasonably acceptable to dunavant and hsns, such opinion stating that dunavant is permitted under the law to sell 350,000 shares held by dunavant since august 13, 1999. hsns shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses of such securities counsel. upon delivery of the opinion, hsns shall issue transfer instructions to its agent to permit such sales as are covered by such legal opinion and as dunavant may direct. if the transfer agent permits the sale, then 350,000 shares shall be subtracted from the number of shares under registration. (iii) it shall be deemed a material breach of this agreement by hsns if for any reason the registration statement has not been declared effective by the sec by july 15, 2001 (or such later date as results from any delay in dunavant's notice to hsns under section ii.e.i). in that event, dunavant shall have the right but not the obligation immediately to commence arbitration proceedings, as hereunder described, against hsns, provided that no delay by dunavant in commencing such proceedings shall be deemed a waiver of any rights that dunavant has under this agreement. 17 (iv) at its option and reasonable discretion, hsns may, instead of filing the registration statement discussed in paragraph ii.e(i), elect to facilitate sale by dunavant of all or some of the shares under registration by arranging for the delivery to dunavant of one (1) written legal opinion each month addressed to dunavant from an attorney from a nationally-recognized law firm who is reasonably experienced in handling sec matters and who is reasonably acceptable to dunavant and hsns, such opinion stating that dunavant is permitted under the law to sell shares and that, as of a particular date, dunavant is permitted under the law to sell, pursuant to sec rule 144, whatever number of shares are allowed under this agreement and/or sec rule 144. hsns shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses of such securities counsel. upon delivery of the opinion, hsns shall issue transfer instructions to its agent to permit such sales as are covered by such legal opinion and as dunavant may direct. if the transfer agent permits the sale, then that number of shares shall be subtracted from the number of shares under registration. the intent of this section ii.e.iv is to reduce the number of shares to be registered by the number of shares as to which dunavant has been provided with an opinion as set forth herein. for example, if a written legal opinion is provided that states that dunavant is free to sell 100,000 shares, and the number of shares under registration is $2,100,000then the number of shares under registration shall be reduced to 2,000,000. f. to the extent permitted by law, dunavant shall be free, but not obligated, to sell any shares of hsns common stock under sec rule 144. g. hsns shall pay dunavant twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,750) on or before the fifth (5th) business day following the execution date, and shall thereafter pay dunavant twenty-five thousand ($25,000) each month on or before the monthly anniversary of the effective date during the period commencing on the first monthly anniversary after the execution date and ending on the date that either a registration statement becomes effective or he has been provided a legal opinion, as described above, as to at least 1,000,000 shares. 18 h. the parties agree that the provisions of paragraphs ii.a, ii.b, ii.c, and ii.g are not a penalty and that they represent a reasonable attempt to remedy the economic harm accruing to dunavant from delays in resolving the controversies surrounding hsns' compliance with the august 13, 1999 agreement. i. dunavant shall not allow any hsns stock owned by him to be shorted on or before the date one (1) year after the execution date. j. upon the execution of this agreement, hsns may withdraw any registration statement(s) currently on file with the sec to register shares for dunavant. iii. possible rescission of amended agreement a. if the funding is not complete on or before the date 120 days after the execution date, then this entire agreement shall be null and void and completely rescinded and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed by the amended and restated settlement agreement, dated as of june 6, 2000, as if this agreement had never existed; and such amended and restated settlement agreement shall be considered to be in full force and effect. iv. release of claims a. release by dunavant dunavant hereby releases hsns, together with each of its officers, directors, agents, employees, attorneys, and representatives, for any and all claims, actions, causes of action, or liabilities of any sort or character, whether known or unknown, arising from the beginning of time to the execution date of this agreement which were asserted in the litigation or could have been asserted in the litigation or

agreement shall be kept confidential by the parties, and shall not be disclosed to any third party except as required by law (including sec disclosure requirements) or as otherwise provided herein.

negotiated new terms and conditions as expressed in an amended and restated settlement agreement, dated june 6, 2000 (the "amended and restated settlement agreement"). due to the parties' desire to facilitate the combination, the parties negotiated this agreement because certain provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement were impeding progress toward the combination and the funding; and, dunavant desires to support and facilitate the combination in exchange for the new issuances of additional shares of the common stock of hsns issued under this agreement. the parties acknowledge and agree that, unless the provisions of paragraph iii.a take effect, this agreement replaces entirely the amended and restated settlement agreement, and the parties shall have no obligations arising from the amended and restated settlement agreement, and hsns and dunavant hereby terminate and have no obligations arising from the selling shareholder agreement dated as of july
