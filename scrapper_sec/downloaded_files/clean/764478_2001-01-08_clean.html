pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. if you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for

board of directors of musicland unanimously adopted resolutions determining that the offer, the merger, the merger agreement, and all other agreements relating to the tender offer and merger were fair

("purpose of the offer; plans for musicland; merger agreement; agreement; top-up option agreement; confidentiality agreement; employment and consulting agreements"). what are the most significant conditions to the offer? &#149; we are not obligated to purchase any shares that you validly tender unless the number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration date of the offer represents, in the aggregate, at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the outstanding shares of musicland on a fully-diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all options, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into voting shares of musicland. we call this condition the "minimum tender condition." &#149; we are also not obligated to purchase any shares which you validly tender if, among other things: &#149; musicland does not continue to operate its business according to ordinary and past practices; &#149; there is a material adverse change in musicland or its business; or &#149; we have not received required approvals under united states antitrust laws. &#149; we are also not obligated to purchase any shares you validly tender if any other conditions as set forth in section 14 ("certain conditions to the offer") and discussed in section 1 ("terms of the offer; expiration date") are not satisfied or waived. how long do i have to decide whether to tender in the offer? &#149; our offer to purchase your shares expires at 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on monday, january 22, 2001. this is called the initial expiration date. see section 1 ("terms of the offer; expiration date"). can en acquisition corp. extend the offer past this expiration date and under what circumstances? &#149; yes, we can extend the offer past the initial expiration date. if we choose to do so, you will be able to tender your shares until 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on the new expiration date. &#149; several terms, which were negotiated by the parties, define the circumstances in which we can extend the offer, including: &#149; if any conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived, or &#149; for any period that may be required to comply with a securities and exchange commission ("sec") rule or regulation. &#149; additionally, we may extend the offer for up to twenty (20) business days if all conditions are satisfied and stockholders have tendered less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of musicland. &#149; after the expiration of the offer, we may provide for a "subsequent offering period" from three to twenty business days. a subsequent offering period is an additional period of time to solicit more shares which begins after we have purchased shares already tendered. we do not currently intend to include a subsequent offering period, although we reserve the right to do so. 2 &#149; see section 1 ("terms of the offer; expiration date"). how will i be notified if the offer is extended? &#149; we will announce an extension no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the business day after a scheduled expiration date by issuing a press release. see section 1 ("terms of the offer; expiration date"). how do i accept your offer and tender my shares? &#149; to tender your shares, you must deliver your share certificates, together with a completed letter of transmittal, to the depositary on or prior to the expiration date. if your shares are held by your broker in street name, you must instruct your broker to tender your shares on your behalf. in either case, wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a., as the depositary, must receive all required documents by the expiration date of the offer. &#149; if you cannot get all of the documents or instruments that you are required to deliver to the depositary in time, you can still tender your shares by following the procedures for guaranteed delivery set forth in this document. &#149; see

payment and payment for shares"). until what time can i withdraw my previously tendered shares? &#149; you can withdraw all or a portion of your tendered shares at any time on or prior to a scheduled expiration date. after the offer expires, the tender is irrevocable unless we have not accepted for payment your shares by february 18, 2001. after this date, you can withdraw your tendered shares

promptly accept for payment those shares that were validly tendered before the expiration. you will not have a right to withdraw your shares during the subsequent offering period. see section 1 ("terms of the offer; expiration date"). how do i withdraw previously tendered shares? &#149; to withdraw your shares, you must deliver written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal to the depositary that specifies your name, address and taxpayer identification number, the number of shares being withdrawn, and the name of the registered holder of the shares, if different from the person who tendered the shares. see section 4 ("withdrawal rights"). what are the tax consequences of the sale of my musicland shares to en acquisition corp.? &#149; the sale of shares to us is a taxable transaction for federal, and possibly state, income tax purposes. in general, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the tax basis of your shares and the amount of cash that you receive from us for the shares. you will 3 generally recognize the gain or loss in the year in which you actually get paid for your shares. &#149; we encourage you to consult with your own tax advisor about the particular effect the tender will have on you. &#149; see section 5 ("certain united states tax considerations"). what is the market value of my shares as of a recent date? &#149; on december 5, 2000, the last full trading day before we signed the merger agreement, the closing price per share of musicland common stock on the new york stock exchange was $8.00. on december 6, 2000, the last full trading day before we announced the offer, the new york stock exchange halted trading in musicland stock due to unusual market activity. on the same day, musicland issued a press release that it was in discussions with a third party regarding a possible business combination, without naming best buy. the closing price per share of musicland common stock on the new york stock exchange on that day was $10.25. on december 20, 2000, the last full trading day before we commenced the offer, the closing price per share of musicland common stock on the new york stock exchange was $12.1875. &#149; we encourage you to obtain a current market quotation for your shares before deciding whether to tender your shares. &#149; see section 6 ("price range of shares; dividends"). what is the total amount of funds that en acquisition corp. will require to consummate the proposed transaction? &#149; we estimate that we will require approximately $425 million to consummate the tender offer and merger. this amount excludes the fees and expenses we will have to pay in connection with the tender offer and the merger. this amount also excludes certain debt of musicland in the aggregate amount of approximately $260 million for which we will ultimately be responsible. see section 10 ("source and amount of funds"). does en acquisition corp. have the financial resources to make payment? &#149; yes, we will obtain all necessary funds through capital contributions or advances by best buy. best buy has sufficient funds to fully fund the offer and the subsequent merger. see section 10 ("source and amount of funds"). is en acquisition corp.'s financial condition relevant to my decision on whether to tender my shares in the offer? &#149; we do not think our financial condition is relevant to your decision whether to tender shares and accept the offer because the offer consists solely of cash, the offer is not subject to any financing condition, best buy has adequate cash available, best buy is a public reporting company that files reports electronically on edgar , and the offer is for all outstanding shares of musicland's common stock. have any stockholders or any directors and officers of musicland already agreed to tender their shares? &#149; yes, stockholders holding shares representing approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of common stock of musicland have entered into shareholder support agreements in which 4 each has agreed to tender all of his or her shares in the offer. these stockholders include most of the directors and certain executive officers of musicland. &#149; see "introduction" to this offer to purchase and section 12 ("purpose of the offer; plans for musicland; merger agreement; shareholder support agreement; top-up option agreement; confidentiality agreement; employment and consulting agreements"). if the tender offer is completed, what will happen to musicland after the offer? &#149; if the offer is consummated, provided certain conditions are met, en acquisition corp. will be merged into musicland. as a result of the merger, musicland will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of best buy. if at least 90% of the musicland shares are tendered in the offer, we will be able to complete the merger without a vote of musicland's stockholders. we will vote all musicland shares we acquire in the tender offer in favor of the merger. &#149; see "introduction" to this offer to purchase and section 12 ("purpose of the offer; plans for musicland; merger agreement; shareholder support agreement; top-up option agreement; confidentiality agreement; employment and consulting agreements"). if the tender offer is completed, will musicland continue as a public company? &#149; if the tender offer is completed, we expect to consummate the merger. if the merger takes place, musicland will no longer be publicly owned or traded on the new york stock exchange, and will cease making filings with the sec. &#149; even if for some reason the merger does not take place, if we purchase all shares that were tendered, there may be so few remaining stockholders of publicly held shares that musicland will no longer be eligible to be traded on the new york stock exchange; there may not be a public trading market for musicland common stock; and musicland may cease making filings with the sec or otherwise cease being required to comply with the sec rules relating to publicly held companies. see section 7 ("effect of the offer on the market for the shares, new york stock exchange listing and exchange act registration"). if i decide not to tender but the tender offer is successful, what will happen to my shares? &#149; if the tender offer is successful and the subsequent merger occurs, stockholders who do not tender will receive the same amount of cash per share that they would have received if they had tendered, subject to any rights of appraisal which they properly exercise under delaware law. therefore, if you do not tender and do not exercise appraisal rights, and if the merger occurs, the only difference to you between tendering in the offer and not tendering is that if you do not tender you will receive payment later without any interest. &#149; see section 7 ("effect of the offer on the market for the shares, new york stock exchange listing and exchange act registration") and section 15 ("certain legal matters and regulatory approvals"). will i have appraisal rights? &#149; no appraisal rights are available in connection with the tender offer. &#149; however, if you choose not to tender your shares in the offer, and the merger is consummated, you have certain rights under delaware law to demand appraisal of your shares. you must comply with the required statutory procedures to exercise your appraisal rights. stockholders asserting appraisal rights who comply with the applicable statutory procedures will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of their shares 5 (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of such fair value in cash. any such judicial determination of the fair value of the shares could be based upon factors other than, or in addition to, the price per share to be paid in the merger or the market value of the shares. the value so determined could be more or less than the price per share to be paid in the merger. see section 15 ("certain legal matters and regulatory approvals") and schedule ii to this offer to purchase for a more complete description and the complete text of the delaware appraisal rights statute. who can i talk to if i have questions about the tender offer? &#149; stockholders can call beacon hill partners, inc. at (800) 755-5001. beacon hill partners, inc. is acting as the information agent for the tender offer. stockholders can also call goldman, sachs &amp; co. at (800) 323-5678. goldman, sachs &amp; co. is acting as the dealer manager for the tender offer. see back cover of this offer to purchase. 6 to: the holders of common stock of musicland stores corporation: introduction en acquisition corp., a delaware corporation (the "purchaser") and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of best buy co., inc., a minnesota corporation ("best buy"), hereby offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the associated company rights (as defined below) (collectively, the "shares"), of musicland stores corporation, a delaware corporation ("musicland"), at a purchase price of $12.55 per share (such price being referred to herein as the "offer price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase and in the related letter of transmittal (which, together with any supplements or amendments, collectively constitute the "offer"). the offer is being made pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of december 6, 2000 (the "merger agreement"), by and among musicland, best buy and the purchaser. the merger agreement provides, among other things, that no later than the second business day after the consummation of the offer and satisfaction or, to the extent permitted under the merger agreement, waiver, of all conditions to the merger, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law ("dgcl"), the purchaser will be merged with and into musicland (the "merger"). upon consummation of the merger, musicland will be the surviving corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of best buy. in the merger, each outstanding share (other than shares held by the purchaser or best buy, treasury shares, which will be cancelled, and shares held by stockholders, if any, who properly exercise appraisal rights) will be converted into and represent the right to receive $12.55 in cash, without interest (the "merger consideration"). the merger and the merger agreement are more fully described in section 12, which also contains a discussion of the treatment of stock options. the board of directors of musicland (the "board of directors" or the "board") has unanimously approved the offer, the merger, and the purchase of shares by the purchaser contemplated by the offer and the top-up option agreement and has determined that the terms of the offer and the merger (including the offer price of $12.55 per share in cash) are in the best interest of musicland's stockholders, and recommends that all stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares pursuant to the offer. donaldson lufkin &amp; jenrette securities corporation, musicland's financial advisor ("dlj"), has delivered to musicland's board of directors its written opinion dated december 6, 2000, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters stated in such opinion, the $12.55 per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares in the offer and the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. the full text of dlj's written opinion is included as an annex to musicland's solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 (the "schedule 14d-9") under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), which is being mailed to stockholders concurrently herewith. stockholders are urged to read the full text of such opinion carefully in its entirety. the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there having been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer a number of shares which would represent at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the total number of outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis (i.e., after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all options, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into voting securities, other than shares issuable (i) pursuant to rights ("company rights") issued under the amended and restated rights agreement, dated as of march 13, 2000, between musicland and wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a., as amended december 6, 2000 (the "musicland rights plan") or (ii) pursuant to the top-up stock option) (the "minimum tender condition"). other conditions to the offer are described in section 14. 7 in order to induce best buy and the purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, certain stockholders of musicland (the "significant stockholders"), consisting of most of its directors, certain executive officers and two separate stockholders have entered into shareholder support agreements, dated as of december 6, 2000 (each, a "shareholder support agreement") with best buy and the purchaser. pursuant to these agreements, the significant stockholders have (i) agreed to tender and sell their shares to the purchaser pursuant to the offer, (ii) agreed to vote such shares in favor of the merger and merger agreement and against any acquisition proposal other than the merger and (iii) granted to best buy and certain officers of best buy an irrevocable proxy to vote such shares in favor of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the significant stockholders own in the aggregate 10,956,784, or approximately 34%, of the currently issued and outstanding shares. musicland has informed the purchaser that as of december 5, 2000, there were 32,125,155 shares issued and outstanding, 4,658,777 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under musicland's outstanding stock options, and no other stock of musicland is outstanding or committed to be issued, other than shares (the number of which cannot yet be determined but is not expected to be material) to be issued on or about december 29, 2000 to two directors who have elected to take restricted stock award grants in lieu of 2000 board meeting fees. based on this information, on a fully-diluted basis, the purchaser believes that the minimum tender condition will be satisfied if the purchaser acquires at least 24,645,234 shares in the offer, 10,956,784 shares of which will be tendered by the significant stockholders pursuant to the shareholder support agreements. best buy owns one (1) share of musicland's common stock. however, assuming outstanding musicland stock options are, pursuant to the merger agreement, converted to cash or assumed by best buy, rather than exercised and tendered, and assuming the tender of shares owned by the significant stockholders, the purchaser believes the minimum tender condition will be satisfied if it acquires 10,567,069 shares. to further induce best buy and the purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, musicland entered into a stock option agreement (the "top-up option agreement") with the purchaser. pursuant to the top-up option agreement, musicland granted to the purchaser an irrevocable option (the "top-up stock option") to purchase that number of shares (the "top-up option shares") equal to the number of shares that, when added to the number of shares owned by the purchaser and best buy immediately following consummation of the offer, will constitute ninety percent (90%) of the shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the top-up option shares) at a purchase price per top-up option share equal to the merger consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the top-up option agreement, including, without limitation, that the top-up stock option would not be exercisable if the number of shares subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares available for issuance. if the top-up stock option is exercised by the purchaser and results in the purchaser and best buy owning ninety percent (90%) or more of the shares then outstanding, the purchaser will be able to effect a short-form merger under dgcl. for a description of the top-up option agreement, see section 12. the purpose of the offer, the merger and the merger agreement is to enable best buy to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, musicland. the merger agreement provides that, promptly following the purchase of and payment for a number of shares that satisfies the minimum tender condition pursuant to the offer, and from time to time thereafter, best buy will be entitled to designate to the board of directors of musicland up to such number of directors as will give best buy representation on the board equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the board, and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares owned by the purchaser and its affiliates bears to the total number of outstanding shares. however, until the time the merger becomes effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the secretary of state of the state of delaware or at such later time thereafter as is provided in the certificate of merger (the "effective time"), there shall be at least three directors on musicland's board of directors who were 8 non-management directors on the date of the merger agreement or who were subsequently elected upon the recommendation of such directors (the "continuing directors"). musicland will also use its best efforts to cause persons designated by best buy to constitute the same percentage as is on the entire board to be on (i) each committee of the board (some of whom may be required to be independent as required by applicable law or rules of the new york stock exchange), (ii) the board of directors of each musicland subsidiary, and (iii) each committee of such board, to the extent permitted by applicable law. in the merger agreement, musicland, subject to certain limitations (see section 12), has agreed to take all action necessary to cause best buy's designees to be elected or appointed as directors of musicland, including increasing the size of the board or securing the resignation of incumbent directors or both. the merger agreement also provides that certain musicland actions prior to the effective time must be approved by the continuing directors. see section 12. the consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, if required by dgcl, the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite vote of the stockholders of musicland. see section 12, section 14 and section 15. under musicland's certificate of incorporation and dgcl, the holders of shares have one vote for each share owned of record. under musicland's certificate of incorporation, a sixty-seven percent (67%) vote of then outstanding shares is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. consequently, if the minimum tender condition is satisfied, the purchaser will have sufficient voting power to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger without the vote of any other stockholders. if the purchaser acquires, pursuant to the offer, by exercising the top-up stock option or otherwise, at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares, the purchaser will be able to consummate the merger without a vote of musicland's stockholders. if, however, the purchaser does not acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, and a vote of musicland's stockholders is required under dgcl, a longer period of time will be required to effect the merger. see section 12 and section 15. tendering stockholders who are record owners of their shares and tender directly to the depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as set forth in instruction 6 of the letter of transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the transfer and sale of shares pursuant to the offer. stockholders who hold their shares through a broker or bank should consult such institution as to whether it charges any service fee. the purchaser will pay all fees and expenses of wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a., as depositary (the "depositary"), beacon hill partners, inc., as information agent (the "information agent") and goldman, sachs &amp; co. as dealer manager (the "dealer manager"), incurred in connection with the offer. see section 16. this offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal contain important information and should be read carefully and in their entirety before any decision is made with respect to the offer. 9 the offer section 1. terms of the offer; expiration date. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), the purchaser will, and best buy will cause it to, accept for payment and pay for all shares validly tendered on or prior to the expiration date, and not properly withdrawn as permitted by section 4 below. the term "expiration date" means 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on monday, january 22, 2001 (the "initial expiration date"), unless and until the purchaser, in accordance with this offer to purchase and the merger agreement, extends the period of time during which the offer is open, in which event the term "expiration date" shall mean the latest time and date at which the offer, as so extended by the purchaser, shall expire. the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, satisfaction of the minimum tender condition. the offer is also subject to conditions related to united states antitrust laws and the other conditions set forth in section 14 below. the purchaser reserves the right (but is not obligated), subject to the terms of the merger agreement and whether or not any shares have theretofore been accepted for payment, to waive any of the conditions of the offer and to make any change in the terms or conditions of the offer in its sole discretion. if by the initial expiration date or any subsequent expiration date any or all of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived, subject to the provisions of the merger agreement as explained below, the purchaser may elect to (i) terminate the offer and return all tendered shares to tendering stockholders, (ii) waive all of the unsatisfied conditions (other than, without the written consent of musicland, the minimum tender condition) and, subject to any required extension, purchase all shares validly tendered by the expiration date and not properly withdrawn or (iii) extend the offer as provided below. the purchaser may not make any change to the offer without the prior written consent of musicland, that (i) reduces the price per share of the shares payable in the offer, (ii) changes the form of consideration payable in the offer, (iii) reduces the number of shares sought pursuant to the offer, (iv) modifies the conditions of the offer in a manner adverse to holders of the shares, (v) imposes additional conditions to the offer, (vi) waives or amends the minimum tender condition or (vii) amends any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to holders of the shares. if at any scheduled expiration date, any conditions to the purchaser's obligation to purchase shares are not satisfied or earlier waived, the purchaser may extend the offer beyond the scheduled expiration date if the purchaser reasonably believes such conditions may be satisfied prior to may 31, 2001. any such extensions shall be in increments of not more than 10 business days each, not to exceed the earlier of the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions or the termination of the merger agreement. in addition, if at the scheduled expiration date, the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or earlier waived, but there have been validly tendered and not withdrawn less than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares, the purchaser may extend the offer for one (1) or more periods of no more than three (3) business days each, not to exceed twenty (20) business days in the aggregate. further, if at the scheduled expiration date any of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or earlier waived but, in the reasonable belief of musicland, may be satisfied prior to may 31, 2001, best buy shall cause the purchaser to extend the offer, if requested by musicland to do so, one or more times for an additional period or periods of time until the earlier of (i) the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived, (ii) the date twenty (20) business days after the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the "hsr act") has expired or been terminated or (iii) the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. in addition to the purchaser's rights and obligations to extend and amend the offer subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, the purchaser (i) will not be required to accept for 10 payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the sec, pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, any tendered shares, and (ii) may terminate the offer or amend the offer as to any shares not then paid for, if any of the conditions specified in section 14 exists or has not been satisfied. the purchaser acknowledges that (i) rule 14e-1(c) under the exchange act, requires the purchaser to pay the consideration offered or return the shares tendered promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the offer, and (ii) the purchaser may not delay acceptance for payment of, or payment for (except as provided in clause (i) of the first sentence of this paragraph), any shares if any of the conditions specified in section 14 exists or has not been satisfied without extending the period of time during which the offer is open. any such extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be followed as promptly as practicable by a public announcement thereof, with any announcement of an extension to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. except as provided by applicable law (including rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the exchange act, which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform them of such changes) and without limiting the manner in which the purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, the purchaser shall have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a press release. if the purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the offer or if it waives a material condition of the offer, the purchaser will extend the offer and disseminate additional tender offer materials to the extent required by rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the exchange act. the minimum period during which an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of the offer, other than a change in price, percentage of securities sought or inclusion of or changes to a dealer's soliciting fee, will depend upon the facts and circumstances, including the materiality, of the changes. in the sec's view, an offer should remain open for a minimum of five business days from the date the material change is first published, sent or given to stockholders and, if material changes are made with respect to information that approaches the significance of price and share levels, a minimum of ten business days may be required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders. accordingly, if, prior to the expiration date, the purchaser increases or, with musicland's consent, decreases the consideration offered pursuant to the offer, or, with musicland's consent, decreases the percentage of shares sought in the offer, and the offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from the date that notice of such increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to stockholders, the offer will be extended at least until the expiration of such tenth business day. for purposes of the offer, a "business day" means any day other than a saturday, sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, new york city time. under no circumstances will interest on the purchase price for shares be paid, regardless of any extension of the offer or any delay in making such payment. during any extension of the offer, all shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain tendered pursuant to the offer, subject to the rights of a tendering stockholder to withdraw the tendered shares. see section 4. pursuant to rule 14d-11 under the exchange act, the purchaser may provide a subsequent offering period of from three business days to twenty business days in length following the expiration of the offer on the expiration date (the "subsequent offering period"). a subsequent offering period would be an additional period of time, following the expiration of the offer and the purchase of shares in the offer, during which stockholders may tender shares not previously tendered into the offer. a subsequent offering period, if one is included, is not an extension of the offer which already will have been completed. the rule 14d-11 provides that the purchaser may provide a subsequent offering period so long as, among other things, (i) the initial twenty business days period of the offer has expired; (ii) the purchaser offers the same form and amount of consideration for shares in the subsequent 11 offering period as in the offer; (iii) the purchaser accepts and promptly pays for all securities tendered during the offer prior to its expiration; (iv) the purchaser announces the results of the offer, including the approximate number and percentage of shares deposited in the offer, no later than 9:00 a.m. new york city time on the next business day after the expiration date and immediately begins the subsequent offering period; and (v) the purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for shares as they are tendered during the subsequent offering period. the purchaser does not currently intend to include a subsequent offering period in the offer, although it reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. the same offer price will be paid to stockholders tendering shares in the offer and in a subsequent offering period, if one is included. musicland has provided the purchaser with its stockholder list and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the offer to holders of shares. this offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of shares whose names appear on musicland's stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing. section 2. acceptance for payment and payment for shares. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), the purchaser will accept for payment and will pay for all shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on or prior to the expiration date promptly after the expiration date provided that the conditions of the offer set forth in section 14 have been satisfied or waived prior to the expiration date. in addition, subject to applicable rules of the sec, the purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares pending receipt of any regulatory approvals specified in section 15. if there is a subsequent offering period, all shares tendered during the subsequent offering period will be immediately accepted for payment and paid for as they are tendered. for purposes of the offer, the purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment (and thereby purchased) shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn if, as and when the purchaser gives oral or written notice to the depositary of its acceptance of such shares for payment pursuant to the offer. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the depositary, which will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from the purchaser and transmitting those payments to stockholders whose shares have been accepted for payment. in all cases, payment for shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such shares (the "share certificates"), or timely confirmation (a "book-entry confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such shares, if such procedure is available, into the depositary's account at the depository trust company (the "book-entry transfer facility") pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 3, (ii) the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message (as defined below) in connection with a book-entry transfer, and (iii) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. for a description of the procedure for tendering shares pursuant to the offer, see section 3. the term "agent's message" means a message from the book-entry transfer facility transmitted to, and received by, the depositary forming a part of a book-entry confirmation, which states that (i) the book-entry transfer facility has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the book-entry transfer facility tendering the shares that are the subject of the 12 book-entry confirmation, (ii) the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and (iii) the purchaser may enforce such agreement against the participant. if for any reason whatsoever acceptance for payment of or payment for any shares tendered pursuant to the offer is delayed or the purchaser is unable to accept for payment or pay for shares tendered pursuant to the offer, then, without prejudice to the purchaser's rights set forth herein, the depositary may nevertheless, on behalf of the purchaser, retain tendered shares, and those shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that the tendering stockholder is entitled to exercise and duly exercises withdrawal rights as described in section 4, subject, however, to the purchaser's obligation under rule 14e-1(c) under the exchange act to pay for shares tendered or return those shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the offer. under no circumstances will interest on the purchase price for shares be paid by the purchaser by reason of any delay in making such payment. if, prior to the expiration date, the purchaser increases the consideration offered to stockholders pursuant to the offer, such increased consideration will be paid to all stockholders whose shares are purchased pursuant to the offer, even if those shares were tendered prior to the increase in consideration. the purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, to one or more corporations directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the purchaser, the right to purchase all or any portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve the purchaser or best buy of its obligations under the offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer. if any tendered shares are not accepted for payment for any reason or if share certificates are submitted for more shares than are tendered, share certificates evidencing unpurchased or untendered shares will be returned (or, in the case of shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 3, such shares will be credited to an account maintained at the book-entry transfer facility), without expense to the tendering stockholder, as promptly as practicable following the expiration, termination or withdrawal of the offer. section 3. procedure for tendering shares. valid tender. except as set forth below, in order for shares to be validly tendered pursuant to the offer: (i) the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry delivery of shares, and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, must be received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this offer to purchase on or prior to the expiration date, and either (a) share certificates evidencing tendered shares must be received by the depositary at such address, or (b) the shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer described below and a book-entry confirmation must be received by the depositary, in each case on or prior to the expiration date; or (ii) the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below. if share certificates are forwarded separately to the depositary, a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) must accompany each delivery. book-entry transfer. the depositary will establish an account with respect to the shares at the book-entry transfer facility for purposes of the offer within two business days after the date of this offer to purchase. any financial institution that is a participant in the system of the book-entry 13 transfer facility may make book-entry delivery of shares by causing the book-entry transfer facility to transfer such shares into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility in accordance with the book-entry transfer facility's transfer procedures. however, although delivery of shares may be effected through book-entry transfer at the book-entry transfer facility, a letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, must in any case be received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this offer to purchase on or prior to the expiration date, or the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below. delivery of documents to the book-entry transfer facility in accordance with the book-entry transfer facility's procedures does not constitute delivery to the depositary. signature guarantees. no signature guarantee is required for shares tendered (i) by a registered holder of shares who has not completed either the box labeled "special payment instructions" or the box labeled "special delivery instructions" on the letter of transmittal or (ii) for the account of an eligible institution. all other tenders of shares must have the signatures on the letters of transmittal guaranteed by a firm which is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is a member in good standing of a recognized medallion signature guarantee program or by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as defined in rule 17ad-15 under the exchange act (each of the foregoing, an "eligible institution"). see instruction 1 of the letter of transmittal. if a share certificate is registered in the name of a person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal, or if payment is to be made, or a share certificate not accepted for payment or not tendered is to be returned, to a person other than the registered holder(s), the share certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appears on the share certificate, with the signature(s) on such share certificate or stock powers guaranteed as provided above. see instructions 1 and 5 of the letter of transmittal. guaranteed delivery. if a stockholder desires to tender shares pursuant to the offer and such stockholder's share certificates are not immediately available, time will not permit all required documents to reach the depositary on or prior to the expiration date, or a stockholder cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, then such stockholder's shares may nevertheless be tendered, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the tender is made by or through an eligible institution; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery, substantially in the form provided by the purchaser herewith, is received by the depositary as provided below on or prior to the expiration date; and (iii) the share certificates evidencing all tendered shares, in proper form for transfer, or a book-entry confirmation, together with the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) properly completed and duly executed with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal, are received by the depositary within three new york stock exchange trading days after the date of execution of the notice of guaranteed delivery. the notice of guaranteed delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted by telegram, facsimile transmission or mailed to the depositary and must include a guarantee by an eligible institution and a representation that the stockholder owns the shares tendered within the meaning of, and that the tender of the shares effected thereby complies with, rule 14e-4 under the exchange act, each in the form set forth in the notice of guaranteed delivery. 14 notwithstanding any other provision hereof, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will in all cases be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (i) share certificates evidencing such shares or a book-entry confirmation of the delivery of such shares (if available), (ii) a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof) or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message, and (iii) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. accordingly, payment may not be made to all tendering stockholders at the same time and will depend upon when share certificates are received by the depositary or book-entry confirmations of tendered shares are received in the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility. the method of delivery of share certificates and all other required documents, including through the book-entry transfer facility, is at the option and risk of the tendering stockholder and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the depositary. if delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. in all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. other requirements. the tender of shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described above will constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the offer, as well as the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty that (i) such stockholder is the owner of the shares within the meaning of rule 14e-4 promulgated under the exchange act, (ii) the tender of such shares complies with rule 14e-4 and (iii) such stockholder has the full power and authority to tender and assign the shares tendered, as specified in the letter of transmittal. the purchaser's acceptance for payment of shares tendered pursuant to the offer will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering stockholder and the purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer. determination of validity. all questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above will be determined by the purchaser, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties. the purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. the purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in any tender of shares of any particular stockholder, whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders. no tender of shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities have been cured or waived. none of the purchaser, best buy, any of their affiliates or assigns, the depositary, the information agent, the dealer manager or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. the purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the offer (including the letter of transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be final and binding. appointment as proxy. by executing a letter of transmittal, a tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints the purchaser, its officers and its designees, and each of them, as the stockholder's attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of substitution, in the manner set forth in the letter of transmittal, to the full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the shares tendered by such stockholder and accepted for payment by the purchaser (and with respect to any and all other shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of the shares on or after the date of this offer to purchase). all such powers of attorney and proxies shall be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered shares. such appointment will be effective if, when and only to the extent that, the purchaser accepts such shares for payment. upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of attorney and proxies given by the stockholder with respect to the shares (and such other shares and securities) will, without further action, be revoked, and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies or written consents may be given or executed (and if given 15 or executed will not be deemed effective with respect thereto by the stockholder). the purchaser, its officers and its designees will, with respect to the shares (and such other shares and securities) for which such appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights of the stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of musicland's stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. the purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the purchaser's payment for such shares, the purchaser must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such shares and other securities, including voting at any meeting of stockholders or acting by written consent without a meeting. backup federal income tax withholding and substitute form w-9. under the "backup withholding" provisions of federal income tax law, the depositary may be required to withhold 31% of the amount of any payments of cash pursuant to the offer. in order to avoid backup withholding, each stockholder surrendering shares in the offer to the extent not previously provided must provide the payer of such cash with the stockholder's correct taxpayer identification number ("tin") on a substitute form w-9 and certify under penalties of perjury that such tin is correct and that the stockholder is not subject to backup withholding. certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. if a stockholder does not provide its correct tin or fails to provide the certifications described above, the internal revenue service ("irs") may impose a penalty on the stockholder and payment of cash to the stockholder pursuant to the offer may be subject to backup withholding. all stockholders surrendering shares pursuant to the offer should complete and sign the substitute form w-9 included in the letter of transmittal to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the depositary). non-corporate foreign stockholders should complete and sign a form w-8, certificate of foreign status (a copy of which may be obtained from the depositary), in order to avoid backup withholding. see instruction 9 of the letter of transmittal. section 4. withdrawal rights. tenders of shares made pursuant to the offer are irrevocable, except that such shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the purchaser pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after february 18, 2001. if the offer expires and the purchaser chooses to provide for a subsequent offering period thereafter, and all the conditions to the offer have been met, the purchaser must pay for all shares already tendered and immediately accept and pay for all shares tendered during the subsequent offering period, and there will be no withdrawal rights during the subsequent offering period. for a withdrawal to be effective, a written, telegraphic or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover page of this offer to purchase. any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the person who tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of such shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such shares. if share certificates evidencing shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such share certificates, the serial numbers shown on such share certificates must be submitted to the depositary and the signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution, unless such shares have been tendered for the account of an eligible institution. if shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedure 16 for book-entry transfer set forth in section 3 of this offer to purchase, the notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the book-entry transfer facility to be credited with the withdrawn shares. if the purchaser extends the offer, is delayed in its acceptance for payment of shares or is unable to accept shares for payment pursuant to the offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the purchaser's rights under the offer, the depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the purchaser, retain tendered shares, and such shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that tendering stockholders are entitled to withdrawal rights as described herein. all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination will be final and binding. none of the purchaser, the depositary, the information agent, the dealer manager or any other person will be under duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. withdrawals of shares may not be rescinded. any shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the offer. however, withdrawn shares may be re-tendered at any time prior to the expiration date, or during a subsequent offering period (if available), by following one of the procedures described in section 3 hereof. section 5. certain united states tax considerations. the following is a summary of certain united states federal income tax consequences of the offer and the merger to stockholders of musicland whose shares are tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer or whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. the discussion is for general information only and does not purport to consider all aspects of united states federal income taxation that might be relevant to stockholders of musicland. the discussion is based on current provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), existing, proposed and temporary regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with a retroactive effect. the discussion applies only to stockholders of musicland in whose hands shares are capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the code and who do not own directly or through attribution 50% or more of the stock of the purchaser. this discussion does not apply to shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, or to certain types of stockholders (such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions and broker-dealers) who may be subject to special rules. this discussion does not discuss the united states federal income tax consequences to any stockholder of musicland who, for united states federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership or a foreign estate or trust, nor does it consider the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws. because individual circumstances may differ, each stockholder should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the applicability of the rules discussed below and the particular tax effects of the offer and the merger, on a beneficial holder of shares, including the application and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local and foreign tax laws and of changes in such laws. the exchange of shares for cash pursuant to the offer or the merger will be a taxable transaction for united states federal income tax purposes and possibly for state, local and foreign income tax purposes as well. in general, a stockholder who sells shares pursuant to the offer or receives cash in exchange for shares pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss for united states federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares sold pursuant to the offer or exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. gain or loss will be determined separately for each 17 block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) tendered pursuant to the offer or exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a stockholder's holding period for such shares is more than one year at the time of consummation of the offer or the merger, as the case may be. capital gains recognized by an individual upon a disposition of a share that has been held for more than one year generally will be subject to a maximum united states federal income tax rate of 20% or, in the case of a share that has been held for one year or less, will be subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates. certain limitations apply to the use of a stockholder's capital losses. a stockholder whose shares are purchased in the offer may be subject to 31% backup withholding unless certain information is provided to the depositary or an exemption applies. see section 3. section 6. price range of shares; dividends. musicland's shares are traded on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") under the symbol "mlg". the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices per share as reported in musicland's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 1999 (the "musicland 10-k") with respect to the fiscal years ended december 31, 1998 and 1999, and thereafter in published financial sources and do not include commissions. high low fiscal year ended december 31, 1998 first quarter $ 12.0625 $ 6.500 second quarter 15.1250 9.8750 third quarter 16.1875 9.1250 fourth quarter 18.0000 8.5000 fiscal year ended december 31, 1999 first quarter $ 15.2500 $ 8.7500 second quarter 12.0625 8.3750 third quarter 11.1875 8.5000 fourth quarter 9.5625 6.7500 current fiscal year ending december 31, 2000 first quarter $ 8.5000 $ 5.8750 second quarter 8.7500 5.8750 third quarter 8.1250 6.8750 fourth quarter (through december 20) 6.0000 12.4375 on december 5, 2000, the last full trading day before we signed the merger agreement, the closing price per share of musicland common stock on the new york stock exchange was $8.00. on december 6, 2000, the last full trading day before we announced the offer, the new york stock exchange halted trading in musicland stock due to unusual market activity. on the same day, musicland issued a press release that it was in talks with a third party regarding a possible business combination, without naming best buy. the closing price per share of musicland common stock on the new york stock exchange on that day was $10.25. on december 20, 2000 the last full day of trading prior to commencement of the offer, the reported closing sales price per share on the nyse was $12.1875. stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for the shares. according to the musicland 10-k, musicland has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and has no plans to pay cash dividends in the future. the current policy of musicland's board of directors is to reinvest in the business of musicland. the terms of musicland's indentures for the 18 9% and 9 7 / 8 % senior subordinated notes restrict the amount of cash dividends that may be paid. pursuant to the merger agreement, musicland is not permitted to declare or pay any dividends on or make any other distributions in respect of any of its capital stock. section 7. effect of the offer on the market for the shares, new york stock exchange listing and exchange act registration. the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of holders of shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares held by stockholders other than the purchaser. the purchaser cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the shares or whether such reduction would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the offer price. nyse quotation. the shares are traded through the nyse. depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares may no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and may, therefore, be delisted from the exchange. according to the nyse's published guidelines, the nyse would consider delisting the shares if, among other things, (i) the number of publicly-held shares (excluding shares held by officers, directors, their immediate families and other concentrated holdings of 10% or more) were less than 600,000, (ii) there were less than 1,200 holders of at least 100 shares and the average monthly trading volume is less than 100,000 shares (for most recent 12 months) or (iii) total global market capitalization is less than $50 million and total shareholder equity is less than $50 million. musicland has advised that, as of december 5, 2000, there were 32,125,155 shares outstanding, 4,585,350 shares held in musicland's treasury, and approximately 470 record holders of such shares. if, as a result of the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the shares no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and the listing of shares is discontinued, the market for the shares could be adversely affected. if the nyse were to delist the shares (which the purchaser intends to cause musicland to seek if it acquires control of musicland and the shares no longer meet the nyse listing requirements), it is possible that the shares would trade on another securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations for the shares would be reported by such exchange or through the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system or other sources. the extent of the public market for the shares and availability of such quotations would, however, depend upon such factors as the number of holders and/or the aggregate market value of the publicly-held shares at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act and other factors. exchange act registration. the shares are currently registered under the exchange act. the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer may result in the shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the exchange act. registration of the shares may be terminated upon application by musicland to the sec if the shares are not listed on a 'national securities exchange' and there are fewer than 300 record holders of shares. termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by musicland to its stockholders and the sec and would make certain provisions of the exchange act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of section 16(b) and the requirements of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders' meetings pursuant to section 14(a), no longer applicable to musicland. if the shares are no longer registered under the exchange act, the requirements of rule 13e-3 under the exchange act with respect to 'going private' transactions 19 would no longer be applicable to musicland. furthermore, the ability of 'affiliates' of musicland and persons holding 'restricted securities' of musicland to dispose of such securities pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act of 1933, as amended, may be impaired or eliminated. if, as a result of the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the merger, musicland is no longer required to maintain registration of the shares under the exchange act, the purchaser intends to cause musicland to apply for termination of such registration. margin regulations. the shares are currently 'margin securities' under the regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve board"), which have the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such shares for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading in securities ("purpose loans"). depending upon factors such as the number of record holders of the shares and the number and market value of publicly-held shares, following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the shares might no longer constitute 'margin securities' for purposes of the federal reserve board's margin regulations and, therefore, could no longer be used as collateral for purpose loans made by brokers. in addition, if registration of the shares under the exchange act is terminated, the shares will no longer constitute 'margin securities.' section 8. certain information concerning musicland. general. musicland is a delaware corporation with its headquarters located at 10400 yellow circle drive, minnetonka, mn 55343. according to the musicland

will engage in activities other than those incident to its formation and capitalization and the transactions contemplated by the offer and the merger agreement. because the purchaser is a newly formed corporation and has minimal assets and capitalization, no meaningful financial information regarding the purchaser is available. the principal executive office of the purchaser is located at 7075

control of, and the entire equity interest in, musicland. the musicland board has unanimously approved the offer, the merger and the merger agreement, and has recommended that all holders of shares tender their shares in the offer. 26 plans for musicland after the offer once the offer is consummated, if permitted by the nyse and the sec, it is the intention of best buy and the purchaser to seek to cause musicland to file applications to withdraw the shares from listing on the nyse and to terminate the registration of the shares under the exchange act. if the offer is successful, best buy and the purchaser intend to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable. if the minimum tender condition is satisfied, the purchaser will have sufficient voting power to approve the merger agreement at the musicland stockholders' meeting without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder. if the purchaser acquires at least 90% of the then outstanding shares in the offer or by exercising the top-up stock option, the merger may be consummated without a stockholder meeting and without the approval of musicland's stockholders. assuming outstanding musicland stock options are, pursuant to the merger agreement, converted to cash or assumed by best buy, rather than exercised and tendered, upon the tender of shares owned by the significant stockholders, the purchaser believes it will need to acquire an additional 17,955,855 shares pursuant to the offer to reach the 90% ownership level necessary to effect such a "short-form" merger. following consummation of the offer and upon satisfaction of the minimum tender condition, the purchaser will have, and intends to exercise, the power as a majority stockholder of musicland to take such steps as are necessary to assure that designees of best buy or the purchaser constitute a majority or more of the directors on the musicland board, including the designation of new directors to the musicland board, and thus to indirectly seek to effect the merger. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the purchaser shall be entitled (and the purchaser intends to exercise such entitlement), promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and

the musicland board. following the merger, best buy will designate all directors on musicland's board. after completion or termination of the offer, the purchaser reserves the right, but has no current intention, to acquire shares in open market or negotiated transactions. there can be no assurance that the purchaser will acquire such additional shares in such circumstances or over what period of time such additional shares, if any, might be acquired. as a consequence, no assurance can be given as to when the purchaser will cause the merger to be consummated, and similarly no assurance can be given as to when the merger consideration will be paid to stockholders who do not tender their shares in the offer. the purchaser is not offering to acquire outstanding musicland stock options (the "options") in the offer. pursuant to the merger agreement, all options that have an exercise price below the offer price will be cancelled in exchange for the payment of the excess, if any, of the offer price over the exercise price for such options, less applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld. all options which have an exercise price above the offer price will be converted into options to purchase shares of the common stock of best buy. following the merger, musicland will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of best buy. except as set forth in this offer to purchase, neither best buy nor the purchaser has discussed with musicland's key management personnel, nor reached any agreement with respect to, the terms of such personnel's continued employment. in connection with the merger agreement, best buy approved expanded severance policies for approximately 660 of musicland's employees. best buy intends, upon acquiring control of musicland, to continue its review and evaluation of musicland and its subsidiaries and their respective assets, businesses, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel. generally, best buy intends to integrate musicland's business into best buy's business, with a view to achieving operating efficiencies and 27 cost savings while maintaining and enhancing customer service. after best buy concludes its review of musicland, it is possible that best buy might modify some of its current plans. except as otherwise described in this offer to purchase, the purchaser has no current plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving musicland; (b) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of musicland; (c) any change in the musicland board or management of musicland, including but not limited to, any plan or proposal to change the number or term of directors, to fill any existing vacancy on the musicland board or change any material term of the employment contract of any executive officer; (d) any material change in the present dividend rate or policy or indebtedness or capitalization of musicland; or (e) any other material change in the musicland corporate structure or business. the merger agreement the following is a summary of certain

the party that provided the information, or (ii) to any representative of a party who needs to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between parties and who agrees to treat such information as confidential under the terms of the confidentiality agreement. each party has agreed to advise its representatives that the united states securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information concerning the matters which are the subject of the confidentiality agreement from purchasing or selling securities of such

eugster, the chairman, chief executive officer and president of musicland, entered into the first amendment and clarification to employment agreement with musicland, musicland group, inc., the operating subsidiary of musicland, and best buy (the "eugster amended employment agreement"). the eugster amended employment agreement provides for the resignation of mr. eugster as an officer of musicland at the effective time. the eugster amended employment agreement also provides for the payment by musicland, in satisfaction of certain severance, retirement, deferred compensation and other payments and benefits mr. eugster would otherwise be entitled to receive if he remained as an executive of musicland or as a result of the termination of his employment, of approximately $16.8 million

buy pursuant to which mr. eugster will provide consulting services to best buy relating to areas within his areas of expertise, such as assisting best buy in developing marketing strategies and advising best buy on business integration issues as may be requested by best buy. the term of the consulting agreement commences at the effective time and expires four years thereafter. the consulting agreement provides that best buy will cause mr. eugster to be appointed as a member of best buy's board of directors and, in recognition of the special circumstances pursuant to which mr. eugster was

provides that mr. eugster will receive an annual fee of $1,000,000. during the term of the consulting agreement, best buy has also agreed to donate up to $100,000 per year to charitable institutions designated by mr. eugster. such contributions will be subject to best buy's charitable giving objectives and mr. eugster will not be entitled to any property or direct economic benefit in connection with such contributions. benson amended employment agreement. concurrent with the execution of the merger agreement, keith a. benson, the vice chairman and chief financial officer of musicland, entered into the first amendment and clarification to employment agreement with musicland, musicland group, inc., the operating subsidiary of musicland, and best buy (the "benson amended employment agreement"). the benson amended employment agreement provides for the resignation of mr. benson as an officer of musicland at the effective time. the benson amended employment agreement also provides for the payment by musicland, in satisfaction of certain severance, retirement, deferred compensation and other payments and benefits mr. benson would otherwise be entitled to receive if he remained as an executive of musicland or as a result of the termination of his employment, of approximately $4.3 million in cash (subject to normal withholding) prior to december 30, 2000, consisting of (1) $0.8 million with respect to the base salary continuation payment following a change in control, (2) $0.3 million with respect to the annual incentive plan continuation payment following a change of control, (3) $0.2 million with respect to the performance cycle under the long-term incentive plan, (4) $0.2 million with respect to the deferred portion of 1998 and 1999 payments that were earned in such prior years, but have not yet been paid, under the annual incentive plan, including earnings per share growth amounts attributable to such deferred portions, and (5) $2.8 million with respect to supplemental retirement benefits payable under the supplemental employee retirement plan. all of mr. benson's musicland options become fully vested when best buy consummates the offer. the benson amended employment agreement prohibits mr. benson from using or disclosing any confidential materials obtained from best buy (except as permitted under the post-merger employment agreement described below). it is also restricts mr. benson, for a period of two years from the effective time of the merger, from (i) engaging in or acquiring any ownership in certain competitors of best buy, (ii) intentionally or knowingly soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee, agent, consultant or representative of, or vendor or supplier to, best buy or its affiliated entities to terminate his or her relationship with best buy, or (iii) soliciting or attempting to solicit any person who is, or, to the knowledge of mr. benson, was in the last 12 months, an employee, agent, consultant or representative of best buy to become an employee, agent, representative or consultant of or to mr. benson or any other individual or entity. post-merger employment agreement. concurrent with the execution of the merger agreement, best buy, musicland and musicland group, inc., the operating subsidiary of musicland, entered into a one-year post merger employment agreement (the "post-merger employment agreement") with keith a. benson for employment as the chief operating officer of musicland. the post-merger employment agreement provides for a salary of $800,000 during the one-year term of the post-merger employment agreement. the post-merger employment agreement also requires best buy to grant to mr. benson an option to purchase 22,500 shares of best buy's common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of best buy's common stock on the date immediately preceding the effective time. additionally, mr. benson is entitled to a monthly car allowance of $2,050. if mr. benson is terminated without cause or terminates his employment for good reasons he is entitled to severance payments equal to his salary for the remaining term of the employment agreement. 45 section 13. dividends and distributions. as described above, the merger agreement provides that, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time (unless best buy agrees otherwise in writing), musicland shall not do or cause or permit, or allow, cause or permit any of its subsidiaries to do, cause or permit, any of the following: (i) cause or permit any amendments to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (ii) declare or pay any dividends or make any other distributions (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of any of its capital stock, or split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, shares of its capital stock, or repurchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of its capital stock; or (iii) issue, deliver or sell or purchase any shares of its capital stock or its securities convertible into such capital stock, or any subscriptions, warrants or other rights to acquire such capital stock or securities convertible into such capital stock, other than an issuance of musicland's common stock pursuant to the exercise of such rights outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, musicland is prohibited from taking any of the actions described in the preceding paragraphs, and nothing therein shall constitute a waiver by the purchaser or best buy of any of its rights under the merger agreement or a limitation of remedies available to the purchaser or best buy for any breach of the merger agreement, including termination thereof. section 14. certain conditions of the offer. notwithstanding any other provision of the offer or the merger agreement, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the purchaser's right to amend the offer, the purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the sec, including, without limitation, rule 14e-1(c) under the exchange act (relating to the purchaser's obligation to pay for or to return tendered shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the offer), pay for any shares tendered pursuant to the offer, and may postpone the acceptance for payment or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, payment for, any shares tendered pursuant to the offer, and may terminate or amend the offer and not accept for payment any shares if: (i) the minimum tender condition shall not have been satisfied or waived pursuant to the merger agreement prior to the expiration date, (ii) any applicable waiting period under the hsr act shall not have expired or been terminated, (iii) at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement and before the acceptance of the shares for payment or payment therefor, any of the following conditions exist: (a) there shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding that has a reasonable likelihood of success brought by any governmental authority against best buy, musicland or any of their respective subsidiaries (1) challenging or seeking to make illegal, materially delay or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the making of the offer, the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, any shares by the purchaser pursuant to the offer or the consummation of the merger, or seeking to obtain damages in connection with any such transactions that would result in a material adverse effect on musicland; (2) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by musicland, best buy or any of their respective subsidiaries of all or any material portion of the business or assets 46 of musicland and its subsidiaries, or best buy or any of its subsidiaries, or to compel musicland, best buy or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of their respective businesses, as a result of the offer or the merger; (3) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of best buy, the purchaser or any other affiliate of best buy to acquire or hold, or exercise effectively full rights of ownership of, any shares acquired by the purchaser in the offer or the merger, including the right to vote any shares on matters properly presented to the stockholders of musicland, including the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the plan of merger included in the certificate of merger, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; or (4) seeking to prohibit best buy or any of its subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any respect the business or operations of musicland and its subsidiaries. (b) there shall have been promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, or deemed applicable to the offer or the merger, by any governmental authority, any law (other than the hsr act), or there shall have been issued any injunction, order or decree by any governmental authority, which (1) restrains or prohibits the making of the offer or the consummation of the merger; (2) prohibits or limits ownership or operation by musicland, best buy or the purchaser of all or any material portion of the business or assets of musicland or any of its subsidiaries, or compels musicland, best buy or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of musicland or any of its subsidiaries, in each case as a result of the consummation of the offer, or the merger; (3) imposes limitations on the ability of best buy or the purchaser to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any shares acquired by the purchaser in the offer or the merger, including the right to vote any such shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of musicland, including the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the plan of merger included in the certificate of merger, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; or (4) requires divestiture by best buy or the purchaser of any shares acquired by the purchaser in the offer or the merger; (c) any representation or warranty of musicland in the merger agreement (which shall be read as though none of them contained any material adverse effect or materiality qualifications) shall not be true and correct in all respects in each case as of the date of the scheduled expiration date of the offer, as such date may be extended in accordance with the merger agreement (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) and the failure to be true and correct, when taken together with all other such failures of the representations and warranties of musicland in the merger agreement (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) to be true and correct in all respects, in the aggregate, has had or would have a material adverse effect on musicland; (d) musicland shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant of musicland to be performed or complied with by it under the merger agreement; (e) the musicland board of directors shall have modified or amended its recommendation of the offer or the merger in any manner adverse to best buy or the purchaser, recommended acceptance of any company acquisition proposal, or resolved to do any of the foregoing; (f) there shall have occurred and continued to exist any general suspension of, or limitation on, trading in securities on any national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the united states (other than any suspension or limitation on trading in any particular 47 security as a result of a computerized trading limit or any intraday suspension due to "circuit breakers"); (g) the u.s. federal reserve board or any other federal governmental authority shall have declared a general banking moratorium or general suspension of payments in respect of banks or any limitation (whether or not mandatory) on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions in the united states; (h) except as disclosed in musicland sec documents or the disclosure letter to the merger agreement, there shall have occurred any change, event or development which, either individually or in the aggregate, would or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on musicland; or (i) the merger agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the purchaser and best buy and may be asserted by the purchaser or best buy or may be waived by the purchaser or best buy in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion; provided that the minimum tender condition may not be waived or amended without the prior written consent of musicland. the failure by best buy or the purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. should the offer be terminated pursuant to the foregoing, all tendered shares not theretofore accepted for payment shall forthwith be returned by the depositary to the tendering stockholders. a public announcement will be made of a material change in, or waiver of, such conditions to the extent required by rules 14d-4(c) and 14d-6(d) under the exchange act, and the offer will be extended in connection with any such change or waiver to the extent required by such rules. section 15. certain legal matters and regulatory approvals. general. the purchaser is not aware of any material pending legal proceeding relating to the offer. except as otherwise set forth in this offer to purchase, based upon an examination of publicly available information filed by musicland with the sec, neither the purchaser nor best buy is aware of (i) any license or other regulatory permit that appears to be material to the business of musicland and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by the purchaser's acquisition of shares (and the indirect acquisition of the stock of musicland's subsidiaries) pursuant to the offer or the merger, or (ii) any filings, approvals or other actions by or with any domestic (federal or state), foreign or supranational governmental authority or administrative or regulatory agency that would be required prior to the acquisition of shares (or the indirect acquisition of the stock of musicland's subsidiaries) by the purchaser as contemplated herein. should any such approval or other action be required, it is the purchaser's present intention to seek such approval or action. however, except as otherwise set forth in this offer to purchase, the purchaser does not presently intend to delay the purchase of shares tendered pursuant to the offer pending the receipt of any such approval or the taking of any such action (subject to the purchaser's right to delay or decline to purchase shares if any of the conditions in section 14 shall not have been satisfied). there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained without substantial conditions or that adverse consequences might not result to the business of musicland, best buy or the purchaser or that certain parts of the businesses of musicland, best buy or the purchaser might not have to be disposed of or held separate or other substantial conditions complied with in order to obtain such approval or other action or, in the event that such approval was not obtained or such other action 48 was not taken, any of which could cause the purchaser to elect to terminate the offer without the purchase of the shares thereunder. the purchaser's obligation under the offer to accept for payment and pay for shares is subject to certain conditions discussed in section 14, including conditions relating to the legal matters discussed in this section 15. state takeover statutes&#151;delaware. musicland is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and is subject to the provisions of section 203 of dgcl regulating certain business combinations. section 203 of the dgcl limits the ability of a delaware corporation to engage in business combinations with "interested stockholders" (defined generally as any beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock in the corporation) unless, among other things, the corporation's board of directors has given its prior approval to either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder." prior to the execution of the merger agreement, musicland's board of directors unanimously approved the offer, the merger, and the purchase of shares contemplated by the offer and the top-up option agreement. accordingly, the purchaser and best buy believe that section 203 of the dgcl is inapplicable to the offer and the merger. state takeover statutes&#151;other. a number of other states have also adopted takeover laws and regulations which purport to varying degrees to be applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations which are incorporated in such states or which have or whose business operations have substantial economic effects in such states, or which have substantial assets, security holders, principal executive offices or principal places of business therein. musicland, directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts business in a number of states throughout the united states, some of which have enacted such laws, including minnesota where the principal executive officers of both companies are located. best buy has made a filing under chapter 80b of the minnesota statutes governing takeovers. except as described herein, the purchaser does not know whether any of these state laws will, by their terms, apply to the offer or the merger and has not complied with any such laws. to the extent that certain provisions of these state takeover statutes purport to apply to the offer, the purchaser believes that such laws conflict with federal law and constitute an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. in 1982, the supreme court of the united states, in edgar v. mite corp. , invalidated on constitutional grounds the illinois business takeovers act, which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. however, in 1987, in cts corp. v. dynamics corp. of america , the supreme court of the united states held that the state of indiana could, as a matter of corporate law and in particular those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquirer from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders; provided that such laws were applicable only under certain conditions. subsequently, a number of federal courts have ruled that various state takeover statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to corporations incorporated outside the state of enactment. should any person seek to apply any state takeover law, the purchaser will take reasonable efforts to resist such application, which may include challenging the validity or applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings. in the event it is asserted that one or more state takeover laws is applicable to the offer or the merger, and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the offer, the purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities. in addition, if enjoined, the purchaser might be unable to accept for payment or pay for any shares tendered pursuant to the offer or be delayed in continuing or consummating the offer and the merger. in such case, the purchaser may not be obligated to accept for payment, or pay for, any shares tendered. see section 14. 49 appraisal rights. appraisal rights are not available in connection with the offer. however, appraisal rights may be available in connection with the merger. if the merger is consummated, stockholders who have not tendered their shares may have the right under dgcl to dissent from the merger and demand appraisal of, and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of, their shares. stockholders who perfect appraisal rights by complying with the procedures set forth in section 262 of the dgcl will be entitled to an appraisal by the delaware court of chancery of the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. in addition, dissenting stockholders may be entitled to receive payment of a fair rate of interest from the date of consummation of the merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of their shares. musicland does not intend to object, assuming proper procedures are followed, to the exercise of appraisal rights by any stockholder and the demand for appraisal of, and payment in cash for the fair value of, the shares. best buy intends, however, to cause musicland, as the surviving corporation, to argue in an appraisal proceeding that, for purposes of the proceeding, the fair value of each share is less than or equal to the merger consideration. in this regard, stockholders should be aware that the opinions of investment banking firms (including the opinion of musicland's financial advisor) as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received in a transaction are not necessarily opinions as to "fair value" under the dgcl. this summary of the rights of dissenting stockholders under dgcl is not a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by stockholders desiring to exercise any dissenters' rights under dgcl. the preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights require strict adherence to the applicable provisions of dgcl. see section 262 of the dgcl which is attached as schedule ii to this offer to purchase. "going private" transactions. the sec has adopted rule 13e-3 under the exchange act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the merger or another business combination following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer in which the purchaser seeks to acquire the remaining shares not held by it. the purchaser believes, however, that rule 13e-3 is not applicable to the merger. rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial information concerning musicland and certain information relating to the fairness of the proposed transaction and the consideration offered to minority stockholders in such transaction, be filed with the sec and disclosed to stockholders prior to consummation of the transaction. stockholder approval. the approval of musicland's board of directors and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the outstanding shares are required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. musicland has represented in the merger agreement that the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by musicland and the consummation by musicland of the transactions contemplated therein have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of musicland, subject to the approval and adoption of the merger by the stockholders of musicland in accordance with musicland's certificate of incorporation. in addition, musicland has represented that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the outstanding shares is the only vote of the holders of any of musicland's capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the merger. therefore, unless the merger is consummated in accordance with the short-form merger provisions under dgcl described below, the only remaining corporate action of musicland will be the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the shares. the merger agreement provides that best buy will vote all shares beneficially owned by it in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement at musicland's stockholders' meeting. in the event that the purchaser acquires that percentage of outstanding shares at least equal to the minimum tender 50 condition, it would have the ability to ensure approval of the merger without the vote of any other stockholder. short-form merger. section 253 of dgcl provides, among other things, that, if the parent corporation owns at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each voting class of a subsidiary corporation, the merger of the subsidiary corporation and the parent corporation may be effected by a resolution adopted and approved by the board of directors of the parent corporation and the appropriate filings with the delaware secretary of state, without any action or vote on the part of the stockholders of the subsidiary corporation. under dgcl, if the purchaser acquires at least ninety percent (90%) of musicland's outstanding shares, the purchaser will be able to effect the merger without a vote of the other stockholders of musicland. in such event, best buy, the purchaser and musicland have agreed in the merger agreement to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of musicland's stockholders. in the event that less than ninety percent (90%) of the shares then outstanding are tendered pursuant to the offer, the purchaser may provide a subsequent offering period so that the merger may be consummated as described in this paragraph. if the purchaser does not acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise, and a vote of musicland's stockholders is required under dgcl, a longer period of time will be required to effect the merger. antitrust. under the hsr act and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the federal trade commission (the "ftc"), certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the ftc and the antitrust division of the department of justice (the "antitrust division") and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. the acquisition of shares by the purchaser pursuant to the offer is subject to the hsr act requirements. under the provisions of the hsr act applicable to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, such purchase may not be made until the expiration of a 15-calendar day waiting period following the required filing of a pre-merger notification and report form under the hsr act by best buy, which best buy submitted on december 19, 2000. the waiting period under the hsr act would expire at 11:59 p.m., new york city time, 15 days after the filing date, unless best buy received a request from the antitrust division or the ftc for additional information or documentary material prior thereto. if such a request were made, the waiting period applicable to the offer will expire on the tenth calendar day after the date of substantial compliance by best buy with such request. thereafter, the waiting period may be extended by court order or by consent of best buy. although musicland is required to file certain information and documentary material with the antitrust division and the ftc in connection with the offer, neither musicland's failure to make such filings nor a request to musicland from the antitrust division or the ftc for additional information or documentary material will extend the waiting period. shares will not be accepted for payment or paid for pursuant to the offer until the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period under the hsr act. see section 14. subject to section 4, any extension of the waiting period will not give rise to any withdrawal rights not otherwise provided for by applicable law. if the purchaser's acquisition of shares is delayed due to a request by the antitrust division or the ftc for additional information or documentary material pursuant to the hsr act, the offer will be extended in certain circumstances. see section 1. no separate hsr act requirements with respect to the merger or the merger agreement will apply if the 15-day waiting period relating to the offer (as described above) has

(d) appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows: (1) if a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section. each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. a proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. a stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or (2) if the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to &sect; 228 or &sect; 253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights. such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the ii-2 corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. if such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. an affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. for purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. if no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given. (e) within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may file a petition in the court of chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof, whichever is later. (f) upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the register in chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. if the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. the register in chancery, if so ordered by the court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city of wilmington, delaware or such publication as the court deems advisable. the forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation. (g) at the hearing on such petition, the court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. the court may require ii-3 the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the register in chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. (h) after determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the court shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. in determining such fair value, the court shall take into account all relevant factors. in determining the fair rate of interest, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the court may, in its discretion, permit discovery or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the register in chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section. (i) the court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. interest may be simple or compound, as the court may direct. payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. the court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the court of chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this state or of any state. (j) the costs of the proceeding may be determined by the court and taxed upon the parties as the court deems equitable in the circumstances. upon application of a stockholder, the court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. (k) from and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the court of chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just. (l) the shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation. ii-4 manually signed facsimile copies of the letter of transmittal will be accepted. the letter of transmittal, certificates for shares and any other required documents should be sent or delivered by each stockholder or his broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to the depositary at one of its addresses set forth below. the depositary for the offer is: wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a. by mail: by hand: by overnight courier, certified or express mail: wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a. shareowner services reorganization department p.o. box 64858 st. paul, mn 55164-0858 wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a. shareowner services reorganization department 161 north concord exchange south st. paul, mn 55075 wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a. shareowner services reorganization department 161 north concord exchange south st. paul, mn 55075 by facsimile transmission: wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a. shareowner services reorganization department (800) 468-9716 (confirm by phone) (651) 450-4163 (fax) by hand in new york: c/o depository trust company 55 water street new york, ny 10041 any questions and requests for assistance or additional copies of the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and related materials may be directed to the information agent or the dealer manager at its address and telephone number set forth below. stockholders may also contact their broker, dealer, commercial bank or trust company for assistance concerning the offer. the information agent for the offer is: beacon hill partners, inc. 90 broad street new york, ny 10004 (800) 755-5001 (call toll free) banks and brokerage firms, please call: (212) 843-8500 e-mail address: info@bhpweb.com the dealer manager for the offer is: goldman, sachs &amp;
