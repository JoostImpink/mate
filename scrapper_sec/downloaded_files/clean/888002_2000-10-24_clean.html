(the "exchange offer") or converted pursuant to the subsequent merger (as herein defined). the ordinary shares that underly the adss to be exchanged will be issued by axa while the cash portion of the merger consideration, which axa currently estimates will be approximately $6.15 billion in the aggregate, is currently expected to be funded from internal sources and borrowings the terms of which are not yet finalized. a copy of the merger agreement is filed as exhibit 15 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction prior to its purchase of the notes, axa had been considering for some time making a significant investment in a united states insurance company as part of its established strategy to expand its international operations. axa acquired the notes in order to become a substantial equity investor in the company. as described in item 3, upon exchange of the notes, axa became the largest stockholder of the company and, after the additional stock transactions described above, now beneficially owns 60.1% of the outstanding common stock. axa exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of the company, equitable and their subsidiaries and has certain rights with respect to the company as described below. under the standstill and registration rights agreement dated as of july 18, 1991 (as amended, the "standstill agreement"), filed as exhibit 10 hereto, if from time to time the percentage of the total voting power (defined in the standstill agreement and generally referring to the total number of votes that may be cast in the election of directors of the company at a meeting of the holders of all the voting securities of the company) represented by the voting power of all voting securities then owned, directly or indirectly, by axa, certain of its affiliates and the trustees (the "axa parties") would be reduced as a result of any new issuance of voting securities or convertible securities, axa (or any other axa party designated by it) has the right to acquire that portion of such new issuance which would result in the percentage of the total voting power immediately after such issuance represented by the aggregate voting power of all voting securities then owned, directly or indirectly, by the axa parties equaling the percentage in effect immediately prior to such issuance (assuming, in the case of convertible securities, the conversion, exchange or exercise at such time of all convertible securities to be issued in such issuance), except that axa's preemptive rights do not apply to, among other things, any issuance of voting securities or convertible securities pursuant to certain axa approved employee benefit plans. axa's preemptive rights will be in effect until the first date on which the axa parties own less than 10% of the total voting power (determined as though all convertible securities owned by any axa party had been converted into voting securities immediately prior to the time of determination). if the company issues voting securities or convertible securities, it is likely that axa will exercise (or designate another axa party to exercise) axa's preemptive rights, although, depending on the circumstances, it is possible that such preemptive rights may not be exercised. in addition, axa has certain demand and piggy back registration rights as provided in the standstill agreement. under the terms of the cooperation agreement dated as of july 18, 1991 (as amended, the "cooperation agreement"), filed as exhibit 11 hereto, equitable, the company and axa have established a cooperation committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives from axa and equitable, that meets at least quarterly. the cooperation committee established an annual cooperation program and page 15 of 19 carries out feasibility studies relating to joint projects and ventures. in addition, the cooperation agreement provides for the establishment of operating committees with respect to strategy, finance and audit matters, asset management, actuarial matters, products, marketing, organization, human resources, public relations and electronic data processing systems. such operating committees are under the direction of the cooperation committee and meet at least quarterly. the cooperation agreement also provides for the exchange of management between axa, equitable and their respective subsidiaries. unless earlier terminated by agreement of the parties, the cooperation agreement terminates upon the earlier to occur of (i) september 30, 2001 and (ii) the first date on which the axa parties own voting securities representing less than 25% of the total voting power. on october 17, 2000, axa and the company entered into the merger agreement, filed as exhibit 15 hereto, relating to the acquisition by axa of the minority interest in the company that axa and its affiliates do not already own. pursuant to the merger agreement, the exchange offer will be followed by the merger of axa merger corp. with and into the company, with the company remaining as the surviving corporation (the "merger"). in connection with the merger agreement, two of the trustees executed a voting agreement dated as of october 17, 2000 (the "voting agreement") to and for the benefit of the company pursuant to which they agreed to take all actions required under the voting trust agreement in order to cause all shares of capital stock of the company held in the voting trust as of the date of any vote required to be taken by holders of such capital stock in order to consummate the merger to be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. a copy of the voting agreement is filed herewith as exhibit 16. in the event the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement are not consummated, the reporting parties may from time to time purchase additional shares of common stock in the open market or in private transactions. the timing and amount of any such purchases will depend on market conditions, business conditions and other factors. in such event, the reporting parties also reserve the right to make a tender offer or acquire shares of common stock in any other manner in order to further increase their interest in the company. furthermore, while the reporting parties have no present intention of doing so, they reserve the right to reduce their interest in the company, in whole or in part, by open market or by private sales of common stock. except as set forth in this statement or in connection with transactions that would be implemented following consummation of the merger, none of the reporting persons has any plan or proposals described in item 4(a)-(j) of schedule 13d. the voting trust agreement, standstill agreement, cooperation agreement, merger agreement and voting agreement are hereby incorporated by reference in this statement and any descriptions thereof contained in this statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) lor finance beneficially owns 28,000,000 shares of common stock,

beaujon, representing in the aggregate 60.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding. all the shares of common stock beneficially owned by axa and its subsidiaries as described above have been deposited in the voting trust pursuant to the terms of the voting trust agreement. accordingly, the trustees may be deemed to be beneficial owners of all shares of common stock beneficially owned by axa, lor finance, financiere 45, ael, axa reassurance, axa re us and societe beaujon. in addition, the mutuelles axa, as a group, and finaxa may be deemed to be beneficial owners of all shares page 16 of 19 of common stock beneficially owned by axa, lor finance, financiere 45, ael, axa reassurance, axa re us and societe beaujon. to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, no executive officer

(c) no reporting person has effected any transaction in the common stock during the past 60 days. to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, no executive officer of any reporting person or member of any reporting person's conseil d'administration or management board, as the case may be, has effected any transaction in the common stock during the past 60 days.

(d) no fractional shares. (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional parent adss shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to this article ii, no dividend or distribution of parent shall relate to such fractional interests, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of parent adss. for purposes of this section 2.02(d), all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. (ii) parent shall pay to each former holder of company common stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional interest to which such former holder (after taking into account all shares of company common stock held at the effective time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the average of the closing prices for a parent ads as reported on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") composite transaction tape (as reported in the wall street journal, northeastern edition, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source reasonably chosen by parent) for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the closing date. parent will deposit or will cause to be deposited a sufficient amount of cash with the exchange agent to cover the payments required to be made pursuant to this section 2.02(d)(ii).
