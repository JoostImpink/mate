provided, however, that nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to require the indemnifying party to waive any crossclaims or counterclaims the indemnifying party may have against the indemnified party for damages. the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain separate counsel, reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party, if the indemnified counsel shall determine, upon the written advice of counsel, that claims of or defenses available to the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with such proceeding may differ. the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel to the extent the indemnified party is entitled to indemnification by the indemnifying party with respect to such claim or proceeding under this section 7.4. if the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnifying party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to such indemnitee to conduct the defense of such claim or proceeding, shall take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof and shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. if the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of any claim or proceeding in accordance with this section 7.4, the indemnifying party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or proceeding, but only with the prior written consent of such indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness thereof; provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of any indemnitee 14 or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any indemnitee or to its conduct of business; and provided, further, that a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete release of such indemnitee and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents with respect to such claim, including any reasonably foreseeable collateral consequences thereof. such indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action, with its own counsel and at its own expense. each indemnitee shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents to, cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in the defense of any claim or proceeding being defended by the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 7.4. if the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any claim or proceeding resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms of this section 7.4, such indemnitee may defend against such claim or proceeding in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such claim or proceeding after giving notice of the same to the indemnifying party, on such terms as such indemnitee may deem appropriate, but only with the prior written consent of indemnitee which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. if any indemnifying party seeks to question the manner in which such indemnitee defended such claim or proceeding or the amount of or nature of any such settlement, such indemnifying party shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such indemnitee did not defend such claim or proceeding in a reasonably prudent manner. 7.5 certain definitions. as used in this section 7, (a) "affiliate" means, with respect to any person or entity, any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such other person or entity;

(c) in the event of any suspension, or any delay in effecting the registration under section 3.2 above, the company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the prospectus so suspended or delayed may be commenced or resumed, as the case may be, and that the suspension will terminate and the holder's ability to sell pursuant to the prospectus so suspended will commence or resume, as the case may be, as soon as practicable and, in the case of a pending development, filing or event referred to in section 3.2(b)(iv) or (v) hereof, as soon, in the judgment of the company's board of directors (in accordance with the provisions of section 3.2), as disclosure of such pending development, filing or event would not have a material adverse effect on the company's ability to consummate the transaction, if any, contemplated by such development, filing or event. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the company shall have the right to cause a maximum of two (2) suspensions pursuant to section 3.2(b)(iv) and (v), neither of which may be within 45 days of the other, as provided above (including for this purpose a delay in effecting the registration pursuant to section 3.2 above) during any 12-month period after the initial effective date of the registration statement, and the total number of days for which all suspensions (including for this purpose a delay in effecting the registration statement pursuant to section 3.2 above) during any 12-month period shall not exceed 90 days in the aggregate; provided that no such individual suspension may be in effect for more than 60 days. (d) the company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement pursuant to which any of the registrable securities are being offered for (i) up to 120 days, (or such shorter period of time as the underwriters need to complete the distribution of the registered offering in any company-primary or secondary offering), in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2, or (ii) in the case of a "shelf" registration statement pursuant to section 3.1 until the date on which each holder may sell all registrable securities then held by such holder without restriction by the volume limitations of rule 144(e). the company from time to time will amend or supplement such registration statement and the prospectus contained therein to the extent necessary to comply with the 1933 act and any applicable state securities statue or regulation. 3.3 underwriting agreement if in connection with any proposed distribution by the holder under the "piggy back" registration referred to in section 2, the company in its discretion shall determine that it is in the best interests of the company to effect distribution by means of an underwriting, the company shall promptly notify the holder of such determination. in such event, in addition to the limitations set forth in section 2, the right of holder to participate in such distribution shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in the underwriting arrangements required by this section 3.3, including without limitation, the requirement that the holder enter into an 6 underwriting agreement and a lock-up agreement (for a period determined by the managing underwriter not to exceed the period agreed to by all directors and officers of the company), each in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for the underwriting by the company. 4. expenses the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with the registration of registrable securities effected by the company pursuant to section 4; provided that holder shall pay the first $50,000 of registration expenses applicable to registrations of holder's shares of common stock under this agreement. holders of registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement shall pay all selling expenses with each such holder bearing a pro rata portion of the selling expenses based upon the number of registrable securities registered by each such holder. 5. expiration of registration rights the obligations of the company under section 2 of this agreement to register the registrable securities shall expire and terminate at the earlier of (a) three years following the closing or (b) such time as the holder shall be entitled or eligible to sell all such securities without restriction and without a need for the filing of a registration statement under the securities act, including without limitation, for any resales of restricted securities made pursuant to rule 144(k) as promulgated by the securities and exchange commission. the determination as to whether the holder is entitled or eligible to sell all registrable securities without the need for registration under the securities act shall be based on a written opinion of counsel that registration of the registrable securities is not required under the securities act, sufficient to permit the transfer agent to transfer such securities upon a sale by the holder. the obligations of the company under section 3 of this agreement shall expire at the time specified in section 3.2(d)(ii). 6. registration procedures in connection with the registration of registrable securities under this agreement, and subject to the other provisions of this agreement, the company shall: (a) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement filed in accordance with section 2 or section 3 to become effective as soon as practicable after the date of filing thereof;

(e) notify each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the 1933 act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing or if it is necessary to amend or supplement such prospectus to comply with the law, and at the request of any such seller, prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities or securities, such prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with the law;

(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the 1933 act, the 1934 act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or any state securities law; and the company will reimburse each such seller, officer, director, partner, agent, employee, underwriter or controlling person for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation (i) which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such seller, underwriter or controlling person or (ii) which is based upon any information in a prospectus that has been amended or supplemented if such seller had been notified of such amendment or supplement and the use of such amendment or supplement by the seller would have avoided the violation. 9 (b) each seller will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its officers, directors, partners, agents or employees, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the 1933 act, any underwriter and any other seller or any of its directors, officers, partners, agents or employees or any person who controls such seller, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, partner, agent, employee, controlling person or underwriter, or other such seller or director, officer, partner, agent, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such seller expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such seller will reimburse any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, partner, agent, employee, controlling person or underwriter, other seller, officer, director, partner, agent, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. notwithstanding anything contained in this agreement to the contrary, the indemnity agreement contained in this section 9(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided further, that the aggregate liability of each seller in connection with any sale of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement in which a violation occurred shall be limited to the net proceeds from such sale. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 9, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing or conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, to the extent prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the indemnified party under this section 9 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 9. (d) if recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this section 9, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses in 10 such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying parties and the indemnified parties, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under section 11(f) of the 1933 act. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances, including, without limitation, whether any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company, on the one hand, or by the holder of registrable securities, on the other hand. the company and stockholders of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. no seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or person controlling such seller shall be obligated to make any contribution hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the net proceeds of the securities sold by such seller, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such seller and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. the obligations of such stockholders to contribute are several in proportion to their respective ownership of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement and not joint. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any contribution by a holder under this section 9(d) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 10. transferability each holder agrees that he will not make any disposition of all or any portion of the registrable securities (a) except in a registered public offering pursuant to the rights granted in this agreement; or (b) until (i) such holder shall have furnished the company with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition and (ii) if reasonably requested by the company, such holder shall have furnished the company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the company, that such disposition will not require registration of such registrable securities or such transaction under the 1933 act or applicable state securities laws. 11. covenants 11.1 board observership during the "development period" (as defined in that certain software and hardware development, license and distribution agreement dated as of march __, 1997 between the company and stockholder (the "development agreement")), stockholder shall be entitled to appoint a non-voting observer to the company's board of directors who is reasonably acceptable to the company;
