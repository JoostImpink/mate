credit agreement &#148;) among integrated device technology, inc., a delaware corporation (the &#147; borrower &#148;), [ ], as administrative agent and collateral agent, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders and the other parties thereto. capitalized terms used herein without definition have the same meanings as in the credit agreement. as of the date hereof, in my capacity as a responsible officer of company (as defined below), and not in my individual or personal capacity, i believe that: 1. company (as used herein &#147; company &#148; means the borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) is not now, nor will the incurrence of the obligations under the credit agreement and the consummation of the acquisition on the closing date (and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of the loans), on a pro forma basis, render company &#147;insolvent&#148; as defined in this paragraph; in this context, &#147;insolvent&#148; means that (i) the fair value of assets (on a going concern basis) of the company is less than the amount that will be required to pay the total liability on existing debts as they become absolute and matured, (ii) the present fair salable value of assets (on a going concern basis) of the company is less than the amount that will be required to pay the total liability on existing debts as they become absolute and matured in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) the company ceases to pay its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due. the term &#147;debts&#148; as used in this certificate includes any legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent and &#147;values of assets&#148; shall mean the amount of which the assets (both tangible and intangible) in their entirety would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under compulsion to act. 2. the incurrence of the obligations under the credit agreement and the consummation of the other transactions on the closing date (and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of the loans), on a pro forma basis, will not leave company with property remaining in its hands constituting &#147;unreasonably small capital&#148;. i understand that &#147;unreasonably small capital&#148; depends upon the nature of the particular business or businesses conducted or to be conducted, and i have reached my conclusion based on my current assumptions regarding the needs and anticipated needs for capital of the businesses conducted or anticipated to be conducted by company in light of projected financial statements and available credit capacity, which current assumption i do not believe to be unreasonable in light of the circumstances applicable thereto. 1 defined terms to be aligned with those in the definitive credit agreement, but consistent with this form of solvency certificate. annex iii-1 in witness whereof, the undersigned has executed this solvency certificate in such undersigned&#146;s capacity as an officer of the borrower, on behalf of the borrower, and not individually, as of the date first above written. integrated device technology, inc. by: name: title: signature page to solvency certificate ex-99.1 4 d337632dex991.htm ex-99.1 ex-99.1 exhibit 99.1 tender and support agreement this tender and support agreement (this &#147;
