(b) number of shares with sole voting and disposition power. the information set forth in items 7 through 13 on the cover page is hereby incorporated by reference. (c) transactions effected during the last sixty days. on august 18, 2005, the issuer acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of parallel robotics systems corporation ("robotics"). thus, robotics became a wholly owned subsidiary of the issuer. thereafter, pursuant to an agreement between the issuer, robotics, and the trust, the trust was to be issued a promissory note (the "note") by robotics (as the maker). in that connection, it was contemplated by the issuer, the trust, and robotics that the trust would acquire shares of stock in the issuer by assigning as consideration its rights as payee under the note to the issuer in exchange for newly issued shares of the issuer's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for a number of shares then yet to be determined. the issuer, as the new payee under the note, would then cancel the note and forgive the debt and any obligations of robotics under the note. the issuer proposed to do this because robotics would not have issued its common stock to the issuer unless the issuer agreed to forgive the debt to be owed by robotics to the issuer following the exchange of debt for equity. the foregoing was disclosed in a form 8-k filed by the issuer august 19, 2005. at the time that 8-k was filed, the exact principal balance of the note was not yet capable of being calculated, so that the exact number of shares of the issuer to be issued to the trust had could also not yet be determined then. 4 subsequently, the trust, and robotics signed an exchange agreement and the note, dated october 26, 2005, copies of which are attached. the executed note reflects a principal balance of $1,836,752.00, payable on demand, with interest at the rate of 8% per annum. pursuant to the exchange agreement, the payee's (i.e., the trust's) rights under the note were assigned by the trust to the issuer, and, in exchange, the trust is to be issued 612,251 shares of the issuer's common stock (restricted). thereafter, the issuer, as the new payee of the note, cancelled the note, thereby relieving robotics of its obligations as maker of the note. although the shares have not yet actually been issued and delivered to the trust, the issuer contemplates that this step will be taken very shortly. (d) rights to dividends, etc. no other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, such securities. (e) cessation of 5% plus ownership. not applicable. items 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. please see the disclosure set forth in item 6 (c), above. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit number description of exhibit exhibit a exchange agreement dated october 26, 2005, between kingston systems, inc., parallel robotics systems corporation, and the flood trust. exhibit b promissory noted dated october 26, 2005, issued by parallel robotics systems corporation to the flood trust. 5 signatures after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set forth in this statement is true and complete. the laurence b. flood trust dated 5/10/96. by: /s/ laurence b. flood dated: april 28, 2006 ----------------------------- laurence b. flood, as trustee 6 exhibits exhibit a exchange agreement dated october 26, 2005, between kingston systems, inc., parallel robotics systems corporation, and the flood trust. exchange agreement this exchange agreement (the "agreement"), entered into this 26th day of october, 2005, by and among kingston systems, inc.
