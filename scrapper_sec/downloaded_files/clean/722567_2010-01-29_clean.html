required to pay hereunder or reimburse any indemnified party within ten (10) days after any written request for such payment. the obligations of the borrowers to the indemnified parties under this section 8 shall be separate obligations to each indemnified party, and the liability of the borrowers to such indemnified parties hereunder shall not be extinguished solely because any indemnified

issued or deemed issued thereunder (whether at maturity, by prepayment or acceleration or otherwise), (ii) any transfer of the note (or pik notes) or any interest therein and (iii) the termination of this agreement or any other investment document. 8.3 indemnification procedures . any person entitled to indemnification under this section 8 shall (i) give prompt written notice to the borrowers of

by the borrowers and reasonably acceptable to the applicable indemnified party; provided , however , that any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in

the borrowers have failed to notify the applicable indemnified party in writing within ten (10) days of its receipt of such written notice claiming a right to be indemnified that it will assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the applicable indemnified party, or (c) a conflict of interest exists between the applicable indemnified party, on the one hand, and

and the applicable indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the borrowers, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, any of the borrowers or such indemnified party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the parties agree that it

(c) procedure for indemnification . each party indemnified under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 1.7 (the &#147; indemnified party &#148;) shall, promptly after receipt of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought, notify the party required to provide indemnification (the &#147; indemnifying party &#148;) in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof; provided , that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have to an indemnified party on account of the indemnity agreement contained in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 1.7 , unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by that failure, and in no event shall relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability it may have to that indemnified party. if any claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of any claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable (except to the extent the proviso to this sentence is applicable, in which event it will be so liable) to the indemnified party under this 9 section 1.7 for any legal or other fees, costs or expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided , that each indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent it and assume its defense (in which case, the indemnifying party shall not represent it) if (i) upon the advice of counsel, the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (ii) in the event the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of such claim or commencement of action, and in each case the fees and expenses of one such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. if any indemnified party employs such separate counsel, it will not enter into any settlement agreement not approved by the indemnifying party, whose approval is not to be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnifying party so assumes the defense thereof, it may not agree to any settlement of any claim or action as the result of which any remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the indemnified party, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party. in any action hereunder as to which the indemnifying party has assumed the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall not be obligated hereunder to reimburse the indemnified party for the costs thereof. if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.7 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying that indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by that indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied specifically for inclusion in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other similar document by the indemnifying party on the one hand or the indemnified party on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to any indemnified party&#146;s stock ownership in the company. in no event, however, shall the investor be required to contribute in excess of the amount of the net proceeds received by the investor in connection with the sale of registrable securities in the offering that is the subject of the loss, claim, damage or liability. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this paragraph shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this paragraph, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending the action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 12(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation. 10 (d) conflict with underwriting agreement . notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. 1.8 information by the investor . the investor shall furnish to the company that information regarding the investor as shall be necessary to enable the company to comply with the provisions hereof in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this agreement. 1.9 rule 144 reporting . with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission that may at any time permit the sale of restricted securities to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration statement on form s-3, the company agrees to use its best efforts to, within one hundred twenty (120) days following the date hereof: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act, at all times after the effective date that the company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of the securities act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#147; exchange act &#148;); (b) file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements); (c) furnish to the investor forthwith upon request a written statement by the company that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to form s-3 (at any time after it so qualifies) or as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents of the company and other information in the possession of or reasonably obtainable by the company as the investor may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing the investor to sell any securities without registration; and (d) take such action, including the voluntary registration of its common stock under section 12 of the exchange act, as is necessary to enable each investor to utilize form s-3 for the sale of its registrable securities, such action to be taken as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal year in which the first registration statement filed by the company for the offering of its securities to the general public is declared effective. 1.10 transfer of registration rights . the rights to cause the company to register securities granted to the investor under section 1.2 , section 1.3 and section 1.4 may be assigned in connection with any transfer or assignment of registrable securities (and only with respect to the transferred registrable securities) by the investor provided that: (a) the transfer may otherwise be effected in accordance with applicable securities laws; (b) the transfer is effected in compliance with the restrictions on transfer contained in this agreement and in any other agreement between the company and the investor; and (c) the assignee or transferee receives at least five percent (5%) of the outstanding common stock and agrees in writing to be bound by 11 the terms of this agreement and assumes all of the obligations of the investor hereunder. for purposes of determining the percentage of shares transferred, the shares owned by the investor shall be aggregated with the shares owned by the affiliates of the investor. subject to the terms of section 1.12 below, no transfer or assignment will divest the investor or any subsequent owner of those rights and powers with respect to the shares of registrable securities still held, unless all registrable securities are transferred or assigned and at such time the transferring investor has no claims for indemnification or contribution pending and no factual basis for such claims exist (whether or not know to the investor). notwithstanding the foregoing, the investor may transfer its rights hereunder to an affiliate without regard to the minimum number of shares specified in clause (c) above. any permitted transferee shall be an &#147;investor&#148; for purposes of this agreement. 1.11 no registration rights to third parties . without the prior written consent of the investor, the company covenants and agrees that it shall not grant, or cause or permit to be created, for the benefit of any person or entity any registration rights of any kind (whether similar to the demand, &#147;piggyback&#148; or form s-3 registration rights described in this section 1 , or otherwise) relating to shares of the company&#146;s common stock or any other securities of the company, other than rights that are subordinate to the investor&#146;s rights to include all of the registrable securities owned by the investor in any registration statement prior to any such person having the right to include any securities of the company owned by them in such registration statement. 1.12 termination of registration rights . the registration rights granted in sections 1.2 , section 1.3 and section 1.4 shall terminate, with respect to the investor, at such time as (a) all registrable securities held by the investor can be sold pursuant to rule 144 without compliance with the registration requirements of the securities act, or (b) all registrable securities held by the investor constitute less than five percent (5%) of the voting securities of the company (on an as-converted basis) and can be sold pursuant to rule 144 within a consecutive three month period without compliance with the registration requirements of the securities act. the respective indemnities, representations and warranties of the investor and the company shall survive a termination of registration rights by reason of this section 1.12 , with respect to any registration of registrable securities effected under this agreement prior to such termination. 2. miscellaneous . 2.1 &#147; market stand-off&#148; agreement; agreement to furnish information . the investor agrees not to sell, transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale of, any common stock (or other securities) of the company held by the investor (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters of common stock (or other securities) of the company not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of a registration statement of the company filed under the securities act; provided , that all executive officers and directors of the company and all other holders of at least three percent (3%) of the outstanding equity securities of the company enter into similar agreements. 12 the investor shall not be subject to this section 2.1 in the

section 2.1 . the investor agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the company or the underwriter which are consistent with the foregoing or which are

or enter into a supplementary agreement for the purpose of adding any provisions to this agreement. neither this agreement nor any provisions hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by a signed statement in writing. any amendment, waiver or supplementary agreement effected in accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon the investor and each future holder
