(collectively, "permal group" and together with the company, gecc and hawley group, the "stockholders") entered into a stockholders agreement (the "stockholders agreement"). the stockholders agreement provides that, subject to certain default rights of gecc described below, the board of directors of the company (the "board") will consist of six members, of whom one will be designated by gecc (such person so designated, and any successor thereto, the "gecc designee"); one will be designated by permal group (such person so designated, and any successor thereto, the "permal designee"); one will be philip m. hawley; and three will be selected by the vote of the gecc designee, the permal designee and philip m. hawley (the "joint designees"). at each meeting of the stockholders of the company held for the purpose of electing directors, the stockholders (other than the hawley trusts) have agreed to take such action as is necessary to cause the gecc designee, the permal designee, philip m. hawley and the joint designees (or any successor to any such person designated in accordance with the stockholders agreement) to be elected as directors (including, in the case of gecc and permal group, causing their respective designees on the board to nominate, and recommend to the stockholders of the company the election of, the gecc designee, the permal designee, philip m. hawley and the joint designees to the board and opposing, and causing their respective designees on the board to oppose, any proposal to remove the gecc designee, the permal designee, philip m. hawley or any joint designee at each meeting of the stockholders of the company at which the election or removal of members of the board is on the agenda), and to take no action which would diminish the prospects of the gecc designee, the permal designee, philip m. hawley or any joint designee being elected to the board or increase the prospects of any gecc designee, permal designee, hawley or any joint designee being removed from the board. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, each of the gecc designee and permal designee will hold office until his death, resignation or removal or until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. if any gecc designee ceases to serve as a director of the company for any reason, the vacancy resulting thereby will be filled by another person designated by gecc. if any permal designee ceases to serve as a director of the company for any reason, the vacancy resulting thereby will be filled by another person designated by permal group. if philip m. hawley ceases to serve as a director of the company, gecc and permal group have agreed to cause their respective designees on the board and the joint designees to take all necessary action to elect a successor to philip m. hawley to fill the vacancy resulting thereby. in the event that at any time there exist vacancies on the board such that there is either no gecc designee or no permal designee, no action may be taken by the board until such vacancy is filled. no gecc designee may be removed from office except by gecc and no permal designee may be removed from office except by permal group. gecc has the right to remove any gecc designee, and permal group has the right to remove any permal designee, with or without cause, at any time. subject to the approval rights of gecc described below, the quorum required for action to be taken by the board (other than an adjournment of any meeting of the board) will be the gecc designee, the permal designee and philip m. hawley. under the stockholders agreement, each stockholder (other than the hawley trusts) has agreed to vote all of its voting shares and to take all other necessary or desirable actions within its control, and the company has agreed to take all necessary and desirable actions within its control, to effectuate the foregoing provisions. the right of each of gecc and permal group to designate directors pursuant to the stockholders agreement will continue only for so long as gecc and its affiliates or permal group, as the case may be, beneficially owns at least 2,000,000 shares of common stock. in addition to its rights under the stockholders agreement, upon the occurrence of any event of default (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) under the notes, then, and in each such case, the board is required to take all necessary action to increase or decrease the size of the board and to appoint to the board a number of additional members (the "additional members") designated by gecc that, when added to any directors then in office designated solely by gecc, will result in directors designated by gecc constituting a majority of the entire board. the holders of 66 2/3% in outstanding principal amount of the notes will be entitled to designate the additional members of the board of directors, and, for so long as such event of default continues, at each subsequent annual meeting the holders of 66 2/3% in outstanding principal amount of the notes will be entitled to propose (and the board will be required to nominate and recommend) persons reasonably acceptable to the board as the additional members of the board. in the event of any vacancy arising by reason of the resignation, death, removal or inability to serve of any additional member, gecc will be entitled to designate a successor to fill such vacancy for the remaining term of such director. at such times as such event of default shall have been cured or waived, the rights of the holders of notes to elect directors will terminate (and the holders of the notes will be required to cause such additional directors to resign from the board), subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above. in addition, under the stockholders agreement, each stockholder which is included in the permal group has agreed that, at each meeting of stockholders and in each action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, such stockholder will vote (or act by consent with respect to) all voting shares over which such stockholder has voting authority in the same manner that the voting shares held by gecc are voted with respect to each matter subject to the vote or consent of stockholders of the company. upon the request of gecc, each such stockholder has agreed to execute an irrevocable proxy authorizing designees of gecc to vote all voting shares over which such stockholder has voting authority in the foregoing manner. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, for so long as gecc is entitled to designate a gecc designee to serve on the board, the approval of the gecc designee will be required for the taking of certain actions by the company or its subsidiaries (except to the extent any such action is specifically authorized under the stockholders agreement, the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement described below or an annual business plan previously approved by the gecc designee), including: (a) a merger with or into or consolidation with any other person; (b) a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up or filing of any voluntary petition in bankruptcy; (c) acquiring all or any substantial portion of the business or assets of any person; (d) entering into any joint venture or partnership or making any debt or equity investment in any person; (e) expanding into new lines of business; (f) assigning to any other person any rights of the company under the stockholders agreement, the registration rights agreement or the securities purchase agreement; (g) any sale, lease or exchange of assets of the company and/or any subsidiary, except for sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business and subleasing of vacant retail space on arm's-length terms; (h) creating, incurring, assuming or suffering to exist any indebtedness other than indebtedness under the loan and security agreement dated as of january 20, 1995 between the company and congress financial corporation (western), as amended, and other indebtedness not to exceed in the aggregate $100,000 at any time outstanding; (i) mortgaging, encumbering, creating, incurring or suffering to exist, liens on its assets (other than liens on assets under indebtedness outstanding as of the date hereof and certain other liens); (j) paying any dividends, or making any distribution on, any shares of its capital stock or redeeming, repurchasing any outstanding shares of its capital stock or any other of its outstanding securities or indebtedness (except for indebtedness (other than indebtedness to any related party (as defined in the stockholders agreement), excluding indebtedness for expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business on behalf of the company and its subsidiaries) to the extent it becomes due in accordance with its terms); (k) making or committing to make during any calendar year any capital expenditure or capital expenditures in an amount in excess of $50,000; (l) issuing or selling any shares of capital stock or rights, options, warrants or other securities exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible into shares of capital stock of the company or any of its subsidiaries, other than upon the exercise of options or warrants outstanding on the date of the stockholders agreement or previously approved by the gecc designee, or granting, amending or terminating any stock appreciation right or other stock-based award; (m) entering into, adopting, amending or terminating any employment or consulting agreement, or hiring or retaining any person who will report directly to the chief executive officer or to whom the company will pay total compensation in excess of $110,000 per year, or entering into, adopting, amending or terminating any employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, except as required by law or generally accepted accounting principles; (n) amending its certificate of incorporation or by- laws or adopting, amending, redeeming or terminating any shareholder rights plan or similar plan or arrangement; (o) amending, modifying or waiving any provision of the stockholders agreement, the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement or the agreements ancillary thereto, or becoming a party to any agreement which by its terms restricts the company's or any of its subsidiaries', or any stockholder's, performance of the terms of any of such agreements; (p) registering any securities under the securities act or granting any registration rights therefor; (q) entering into, amending or terminating, or waiving any material rights of the company and its subsidiaries under, any contract, arrangement or transaction involving consideration in excess of $50,000 or which is otherwise material to the company or any of its subsidiaries; (r) entering into, amending or terminating any contract, arrangement or transaction with a related party, other than the payment of salary and benefits pursuant to employment arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business in compliance with the stockholders agreement; (s) entering into, adopting, amending (whether by agreement or by conduct of the business), except as required by law or generally accepted accounting principles, or terminating any annual business plan; or (t) taking any action required by law to be approved by the board. the stockholders agreement provides that in the event that any stockholder intends to sell any common stock or common stock equivalents other than pursuant to a registered public offering and other than sales on nasdaq or a national securities exchange of shares which, when aggregated with all other sales by such stockholder and any other members of the hawley group (in the case of any member of the hawley group) or the permal group (in the case of any member of the permal group) from and after the date of the stockholders agreement, would represent not more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate, each of the other stockholders (including gecc) is entitled to exercise a right of first offer to acquire its pro rata portion of the shares of common stock or common stock equivalents to be sold by the selling stockholders. in addition, if any of the hawley trusts intends to sell any common stock pursuant to certain shelf registration rights granted to the hawley trusts, gecc and each of the other stockholders is entitled (if the company declines to exercise in whole or in part a right of first offer in favor of the company) to exercise a right of first offer to acquire its pro rata portion of the shares to be sold by the selling hawley trust. under the stockholders agreement, if gecc or any member of permal group, whether acting alone or in concert with any other stockholder (collectively, the "selling stockholders") pursuant to a common plan, understanding or arrangement, enters into an agreement to sell or otherwise proposes to sell to any person or group (other than pursuant to a registered public offering), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any common stock or common stock equivalents, such that immediately following the consummation of such sale, the selling stockholders would have sold to such person or group in the aggregate common stock or common stock equivalents representing in excess of 3,000,000 shares of common stock or common stock equivalents with respect to sales by the hawley trusts, then each of the other stockholders will have the right to participate in such sale by selling a number of shares of common stock equal to such stockholder's "proportionate share", as part of the sale by the selling stockholders, on the same terms as those applicable to the sale by the selling stockholders. "proportionate share" means, with respect to each stockholder, a number of shares of common stock which bears the same ratio to the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder on a fully diluted basis as the number of shares being sold by the selling stockholders bears to the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the selling stockholders on a fully diluted basis. pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, gecc also has rights of first offer to acquire its pro rata portion of any debt securities, capital stock or capital stock equivalents which the company proposes to sell, other than pursuant to a registered public offering. except as set forth above, no reporting person nor, to the best knowledge of the applicable reporting person, any person identified in schedule i through iii, has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in the types of transactions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) gecc has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to 6,400,000 shares of common stock (including 1,400,000 shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant), representing approximately 34.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock (assuming the exercise of the warrant). in addition, by reason of the provisions of the stockholders agreement pursuant to which the members of permal group have agreed to vote their shares of the company in the same manner as gecc, gecc may be deemed to have shared voting power with respect to an aggregate of 6,679,086 shares of common stock, representing approximately 35.7% of the outstanding shares of common stock (assuming the exercise of the warrant). in addition, by reason of certain of the provisions of the stockholders agreement described in item 4, gecc may be deemed to constitute a "group," as such term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act, with permal group and the hawleys. if gecc, permal group and the hawleys were deemed to constitute a group, the 13,661,072 shares of common stock beneficially owned by gecc, permal group and the hawleys in the aggregate (which includes the 6,400,000 shares of common stock beneficially owned by gecc, an aggregate of 6,679,086 shares of common stock held by members of permal group, 50,000 shares of common stock held by the hawleys, 308,500 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options exercisable within 60 days by philip m. hawley and an aggregate of 223,486 shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options exercisable within 60 days by members of permal group) would represent approximately 71.0% of the shares of common stock (assuming the exercise of the warrant and all options or warrants exercisable within 60 days by members of permal group and philip m. hawley). gecc understands that the hawleys and the members of permal group are making separate filings on schedule 13d with respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. (b) the responses of each reporting person to items 7 through 11 of the cover pages of this schedule 13d relating to beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock are incorporated herein by reference. (c) except as set forth above, no reporting person nor, to the best knowledge of the applicable reporting person, any person identified in schedule i through iii, beneficially owns any shares of common stock or has effected any transactions in shares of common stock during the preceding 60 days. (d) not applicable.

and chester l. walsh v. general electric company on november 15, 1990, an action under the federal false claims act 31 u.s.c. sections 3729-32, was filed under seal against general electric company ("ge") in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio. the qui tam action, brought by an organization called taxpayers against fraud and an employee of ge's aircraft engines division ("geae"), alleged that geae, in connection with its sales of f110 aircraft engines and support equipment to israel, made false statements to the israeli ministry of defense (mod), causing mod to submit false claims to the united states department of defense under the foreign military sales program. senior ge management became aware of possible misconduct in geae's israeli f110 program in december 1990. before learning of the sealed qui tam suit, ge immediately made a voluntary disclosure to the departments of defense and justice, promised full cooperation and restitution, and began an internal investigation. in august 1991, the federal court action was unsealed, and the department of justice intervened and took over responsibility for the case. on july 22, 1992, after ge had completed its investigation and made a complete factual disclosure to the u.s. government as part of settlement discussions, the united states and ge executed a settlement agreement and filed a stipulation dismissing the civil action. without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ge agreed to pay $59.5 million in full settlement of the civil fraud claims. also on july 22, 1992, in connection with the same matter, the united states filed a four count information charging ge with violations of 18 u.s.c. section 287 (submitting false claims against the united states), 18 u.s.c. section 1957 (engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property), and 15 u.s.c. sections 78m(b)(2)(a) and 78ff(a) (inaccurate books and records), and 18 u.s.c. section 371 (conspiracy to defraud the united states and to commit offenses against the united states). the same day, ge and the united states entered a plea agreement in which ge agreed to waive indictment, plead guilty to the information, and pay a fine of $9.5 million. ge was that day sentenced by the federal court in accordance with the plea agreement. ex-99.1 2 securities purchase agreement between

subsidiaries and the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the holders of securities. 6.8. insurance. the company will, and will cause each of the subsidiaries to maintain, with insurers believed by the company to be responsible, such insurance, in such amounts and of such types as are customarily carried under similar circumstances by companies engaged in the same or a

limitation, such as may arise under section 4062, 4063, or 4064 of erisa or any similar provision of law), and (ii) all claims or demands of materialmen, mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other like persons which, in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii), if unpaid, might result in the creation of a material lien upon any of its properties, provided, however, that the

directors a number of additional members (the "additional members") designated by the purchaser that, when added to any directors then in office designated solely by the purchaser, will result in directors designated by the purchaser constituting a majority of the entire board of directors. the holders of 66 2/3% in outstanding principal amount of the notes shall be entitled to designate the additional members of the board of directors, and, for so long as such breach or event of default continues, at each subsequent annual meeting the holders of 66 2/3% in outstanding principal amount of the notes shall be entitled to propose (and the board of directors shall nominate and recommend) persons reasonably acceptable to the board of directors as the additional members of the board of directors of the company. in the event of any vacancy arising by reason of the resignation, death, removal or inability to serve of any additional member, the purchaser shall be entitled to designate

asset of the company or any subsidiary for the benefit of any plan, or incur any liability which would be material to the company or any of its subsidiaries under title iv of erisa, including withdrawal liability (other than the payment of premiums, none of which are overdue). neither the company nor any subsidiary, nor any other person including any fiduciary, will engage in any transaction prohibited by section 406 of erisa or section 4975 of the code which is reasonably likely to subject the company, any subsidiary or any entity that the company or any subsidiary has an obligation to indemnify to any tax or penalty imposed under section 4975 of the code or section 502 of erisa. 6.12. financial statements and other reports.

(b) in the event that all or any part of the junior indebtedness is declared or becomes due and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default or otherwise than at the option of the company (other than pursuant to its terms at its final maturity), under circumstances when the foregoing clause (a) shall not be applicable, the holders of the junior indebtedness shall be entitled to payments only after there shall first have been paid in full all senior indebtedness of the company or payment shall have been provided therefor in a manner satisfactory to the holders of such senior indebtedness. (c) upon the occurrence of an event which is, or with the lapse of time or notice or both would be, an event which gives any holder of any senior indebtedness of the company the right to demand payment, cash collateral, accelerate the maturity, or terminate any commitment to further extend credit, no payment shall be made on any junior indebtedness if either: (i) notice of such default in writing or by telegram has been given to the company by any holder of any senior indebtedness of the company, provided that judicial proceedings shall be commenced with respect to such default (x) within 180 days thereafter if such default consists of the nonpayment of principal, interest, or any other sum due on such senior indebtedness, or (y) within 180 days after the earlier of (i) the giving of such notice or (ii) the date on which such holder is entitled to institute judicial proceedings, or (ii) judicial proceedings shall be pending in respect of such default. the holder of any portion of senior indebtedness of the company shall not be entitled to give notice pursuant to this clause (c) more than once with respect to any default which was specified in such notice and which has continued without interruption since the date such notice was given, nor shall such holder be entitled to give a separate notice with respect to any default not so specified which (to the knowledge of the holder giving notice) was existing on the date such notice was given pursuant to this clause (c) and which has continued without interruption from the date such notice was given. upon receipt of any notice from any holder of any senior indebtedness pursuant to this clause (c), the company shall forthwith send a copy thereof to each holder of junior indebtedness and each holder of its senior indebtedness at the time outstanding. (d) all payments, cash, or noncash distributions made to the holders of junior indebtedness which should have been made to the holders of senior indebtedness of the company shall be received and held by the former in trust for the benefit of the latter, and the holders of junior indebtedness shall forthwith remit such payments, cash, or noncash distributions to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company, pro rata, in the form in which it was received, together with such endorsements or documents as may be necessary to effectively negotiate or transfer the same to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company. (e) each holder of senior indebtedness of the company is hereby authorized by the purchaser to: (i) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time of payment, or any other terms, of any senior indebtedness of the company held by such holder; (ii) increase or decrease the rate of interest payable thereon or any part thereof; (iii) exchange, enforce, waive or release any security therefor; (iv) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof in such manner as such holder may at its discretion determine;

and, for the purposes of such subrogation, payments or distributions to the holders of senior indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which any holder of notes would be entitled except for the provisions of this agreement shall, as between the company and its creditors other than the holders of senior indebtedness and holders of the notes, be deemed to be a payment by the company to or on account of the notes, it being understood that the provisions of this agreement are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of the notes on the one hand, and the holders of senior indebtedness, on the other hand. the purpose of this section 10.6 is to grant to holders of the notes the same rights against the company with respect to the aggregate amount of such payments or distributions as the holders of senior indebtedness would have against the company if such aggregate amount were considered overdue senior indebtedness. 11. interpretation. 11.1 definitions.

sentence, the company shall execute or cause to be executed and deliver or cause to be delivered to holder a certificate or certificates representing the aggregate number of full shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, as hereinafter provided. the stock certificate or certificates so delivered shall be in such denomination or

warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denomination specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new warrant evidencing the portion of

of the warrants. 4. adjustments the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and/or the price at which such shares may be purchased upon exercise of this warrant, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this section 4. the company shall give each holder notice of any event described below which requires an adjustment pursuant to this section 4 at the time of such event. 4.1. stock dividends, subdivisions and combinations. if at any time the company shall: (a) take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend payable in, or other distribution of, additional shares of common stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares of common stock, or (c) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, then the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately after the occurrence of any such event shall be adjusted to equal the number of shares of common stock which a record holder of the same number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the occurrence of such event would own or be entitled to receive after the happening of such event. 4.2. certain other distributions. if at any time the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or other distribution of: (a) cash, (b) any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (other than cash, convertible securities or additional shares of common stock), or (c) any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (other than cash, convertible securities or additional shares of common stock), then the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted to equal the product of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share of common stock at the date of taking such record and (b) the denominator of which shall be such current market price per share of common stock minus the amount allocable to one share of common stock of any such cash so distributable and of the fair value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company and supported by an opinion from an investment banking firm of recognized national standing acceptable to the majority holders) of any and all such evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock, other securities or property or warrants or other subscription or purchase rights so distributable. a reclassification of the common stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value) into shares of common stock and shares of any other class of stock shall be deemed a distribution by the company to the holders of its common stock of such shares of such other class of stock within the meaning of this section 4.2 and, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into a larger or smaller number of shares of common stock as a part of such reclassification, such change shall be deemed a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the outstanding shares of common stock within the meaning of section 4.1. 4.3 issuance of additional shares of common stock (a) if at any time the company shall (except as hereinafter provided) issue or sell any additional shares of common stock, other than permitted issuances, for consideration in an amount per additional share of common stock less than the current market price, then the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted to equal the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such issue or sale by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale, and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of such additional shares of common stock would purchase at the then current market price. (b) the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 4.3 shall not apply to any issuance of additional shares of common stock for which an adjustment is provided under section 4.1 or 4.2. no adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant shall be exercisable shall be made under paragraph (a) of this section 4.3 upon the issuance of any additional shares of common stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights or pursuant to the exercise of any conversion or exchange rights in any convertible securities, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights or upon the issuance of such convertible securities (or upon the issuance of any warrant or other rights therefor) pursuant to section 4.4 or section 4.5 herein. 4.4. issuance of warrants or other rights. if at any time the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution of, or shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell, any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in section 4.3 on the basis that the maximum number of additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to all such warrants or other rights or necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding and the company shall have received all of the consideration payable therefor, if any, as of the date of the actual issuance of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and such warrants or other rights. no further adjustments shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon such conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall be required under this section 4.4 solely by reason of the issuance of stock purchase rights under a stockholder rights plan of the company, provided that the adjustments required by this section 4.4 shall be made if any "flip-in" or "flip-over" event shall occur under such stockholder rights plan. 4.5. issuance of convertible securities. if at any time the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution of, or shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell, any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange shall be less than the current market price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in section 4.3 on the basis that the maximum number of additional shares of common stock necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding and the company shall have received all of the consideration payable therefor, if any, as of the date of actual issuance of such convertible securities. no adjustment of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable shall be made under this section 4.5 upon the issuance of any convertible securities which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights therefor, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights pursuant to section 4.4. no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and, if any issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any warrant or other right to subscribe for or to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 4, no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 4.6. superseding adjustment. if, at any time after any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall have been made pursuant to section 4.4 or section 4.5 as the result of any issuance of warrants, rights or convertible securities, (a) such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange in such other convertible securities, shall expire, and all or a portion of such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange with respect to all or a portion of such other convertible securities, as the case may be, shall not have been exercised, or (b) the consideration per share for which shares of common stock are issuable pursuant to such warrants or rights, or the terms of such other convertible securities, shall be increased solely by virtue of provisions therein contained for an automatic increase in such consideration per share upon the occurrence of a specified date or event, then for each outstanding warrant such previous adjustment shall be rescinded and annulled and the additional shares of common stock which were deemed to have been issued by virtue of the computation made in connection with the adjustment so rescinded and annulled shall no longer be deemed to have been issued by virtue of such computation. thereupon, a recomputation shall be made of the effect of such rights or options or other convertible securities on the basis of (c) treating the number of additional shares of common stock or other property, if any, theretofore actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of any such warrants or rights or any such right of conversion or exchange, as having been issued on the date or dates of any such exercise and for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor, and (d) treating any such warrants or rights or any such other convertible securities which then remain outstanding as having been granted or issued immediately after the time of such increase of the consideration per share for which shares of common stock or other property are issuable under such warrants or rights or other convertible securities; whereupon a new adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be made, which new adjustment shall supersede the previous adjustment so rescinded and annulled. 4.7. other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable provided for in this section 4: (a) computation of consideration. to the extent that any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities shall be issued for cash consideration, the consideration received by the company therefor shall be the amount of the cash received by the company therefor, or, if such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are offered by the company for subscription, the subscription price, or, if such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering, the public offering price (in any such case subtracting any amounts paid or receivable for accrued interest or accrued dividends and without taking into account any compensation, discounts or expenses paid or incurred by the company for and in the underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with, the issuance thereof). to the extent that such issuance shall be for a consideration other than cash, then, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the amount of such consideration shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration at the time of such issuance as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. in case any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger in which the company issues any securities, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving corporation as such board in good faith shall determine to be attributable to such additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or other rights, as the case may be. the consideration for any additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase the same shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing such warrants or other rights plus the additional consideration payable to the company upon exercise of such warrants or other rights. the consideration for any additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of any convertible securities shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such convertible securities, plus the consideration paid or payable to the company in respect of the subscription for or purchase of such convertible securities, plus the additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the exercise of the right of conversion or exchange in such convertible securities. in case of the issuance at any time of any additional shares of common stock or convertible securities in payment or satisfaction of any dividends upon any class of stock other than common stock, the company shall be deemed to have received for such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities a consideration equal to the amount of such dividend so paid or satisfied. (b) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring an adjustment shall occur, except that any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable that would otherwise be required may be postponed (except in the case of a subdivision or combination of shares of the common stock, as provided for in section 4.1) up to, but not beyond the date of exercise if such adjustment either by itself or with other adjustments not previously results in an increase or decrease of less than 1% of the shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the making of such adjustment. any adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount (except as aforesaid) which is postponed shall be carried forward and made as soon as such adjustment, together with other adjustments required by this section 4 and not previously made, would result in a minimum adjustment or on the date of exercise. for the purpose of any adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (c) fractional interests. in computing adjustments under this section 4, fractional interests in common stock shall be taken into account to the nearest 1/100th of a share. (d) when adjustment not required. if the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (e) escrow of warrant stock. if after any property becomes distributable pursuant to this section 4 by reason of the taking of any record of the holders of common stock, but prior to the occurrence of the event for which such record is taken, holder exercises this warrant, any additional shares of common stock issuable upon exercise by reason of such adjustment shall be deemed the last shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercised (notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein) and such shares or other property shall be held in escrow for holder by the company to be issued to holder when and to the extent that the event actually takes place, upon payment of the warrant price. notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, if the event for which such record was taken fails to occur or is rescinded, then such escrowed shares shall be canceled by the company and escrowed property returned. 4.8. reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. in case the company shall reorganize its capital, reclassify its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another corporation (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is a change in or distribution with respect to the common stock of the company), or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its property, assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation, or any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation ("other property"), are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock of the company, then holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant and payment of the warrant price, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the company, if it is the surviving corporation, and other property receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event. in case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, the successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed appropriate (as determined by resolution of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of shares of the common stock for which this warrant is exercisable which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4. for purposes of this section 4.8, "common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation" shall include stock of such corporation of any class which is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and which is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.8 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of assets. 4.9. other action affecting common stock. in case at any time or from time to time the company shall take any action in respect of its common stock, other than any action described in this section 4, then, unless such action will not have a materially adverse effect upon the rights of the holders, the number of shares of common stock or other stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted in such manner as may be equitable in the circumstances. 5. notices to warrant holders 5.1. notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted pursuant to section 4, the company shall forthwith prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which the board of directors of the company determined the fair value of any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock, other securities or property or warrants or other subscription or purchase rights referred to in section 4.2 or 4.7(a)), specifying the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.8) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, after giving effect to such adjustment. the company shall promptly cause a signed copy of such certificate to be delivered to each holder in accordance with section 13.2. the company shall keep at its principal office copies of all such certificates and cause the same to be available for inspection at said office during normal business hours by any holder or any prospective purchaser of a warrant designated by a holder thereof. 5.2. notice of corporate action. if at any time (a) the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend (other than a cash dividend payable out of earnings or earned surplus legally available for the payment of dividends under the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the company) or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or (b) there shall be any capital reorganization of the company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the company or any consolidation or merger of the company with, or any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the property, assets or business of the company to, another corporation, or (c) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; then, in any one or more of such cases, the company shall give to holder (i) at least 20 days' prior written notice of the date on which a record date shall be selected for such dividend, distribution or right or for determining rights to vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, and (ii) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, at least 20 days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place. such notice in accordance with the foregoing clause also shall specify (i) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to any such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character thereof, and (ii) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the time, if any such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. each such written notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed to holder at the last address of holder appearing on the books of the company and delivered in accordance with section 13.2. 6. rights of holders 6.1 no impairment. the company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its certificate of incorporation or comparable governing instruments or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company will (a) not increase the par value of any shares of common stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (b) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock upon the exercise of this warrant, and (c) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. upon the request of holder, the company will at any

warrants. all shares of common stock which shall be so issuable, when issued upon exercise of any warrant and payment therefor in accordance with the terms of such warrant, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to preemptive rights. 8. taking of record; stock and warrant transfer books in the case of all dividends or other distributions by the company

take such record as of the close of business on a business day. the company will not at any time, except upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, close its stock transfer books or

restricted common stock in supplying such information as may be reasonably necessary for such holder to complete and file any reports or forms presently or hereafter required by the commission as a

(a) right to include registrable securities. if the company proposes at any time to register any of its securities under the securities act (other than a shelf registration statement) by registration on forms s-1, s-2 or s-3 or any successor or similar form(s) (except registrations on such forms or similar form(s) solely for registration of securities in connection with an employee benefit plan or dividend reinvestment plan or a merger, reorganization, or consolidation), whether or not for sale for its own account, it will, subject to section 2.8 hereof, each such time give prompt written notice to all registered holders of registrable securities of its intention to do so and of such holders' rights under this section 2.2. upon the written request of any such holder (a "requesting holder") made as promptly as practicable and in any event within 20 days after the receipt of any such notice (10 days if the company states in such written notice or gives telephonic notice to all registered holders of registrable securities, with written confirmation to follow promptly thereafter, that (i) such registration will be on form s-3 and (ii) such shorter period of time is required because of a planned filing date) (which request shall specify the registrable securities intended to be disposed of by such requesting holder), the company will, subject to section 2.8 hereof, use its best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all registrable securities which the company has been so requested to register by the requesting holders thereof; provided, however, that if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each requesting holder of registrable securities and (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from any obligation of the company to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holder or holders of registrable securities entitled to do so to request that such registration be effected as a registration under section 2.1 and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. no registration effected under this section 2.2 shall relieve the company of its obligation to effect any registration upon request under section 2.1. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with registration of registrable securities requested pursuant to this section 2.2. (b) priority in incidental registrations. if the managing underwriter of any underwritten offering shall inform the company (or, in the case of a secondary offering, the selling stockholders initiating such offering) of its belief that the number or type of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration would materially adversely affect such offering, then the company will include in such registration, to the extent of the number and type which the company is (or the selling stockholders initiating such offering are) so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering, first, all securities proposed by the company (or, in the case of a secondary offering, the selling stockholders initiating such offering) to be sold for its (or their) own account, and second, such registrable securities and any other securities of the company requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among all such holders on the basis of the estimated gross proceeds of the securities of such holders requested to be so included. (c) selection of managing underwriter. the managing underwriter of any underwritten offering pursuant to this section 2.2 shall be selected by the company at its sole discretion. 2.3. registration procedures. if and whenever the company is required to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act as provided in section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.9, the company will as expeditiously as possible: (i) in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.1 or 2.2, prepare and (as soon as practicable, and in any event within 75 days in the case of forms s-1 or s-2 and 30 days in the case of a registration requested on form s-3 after the end of the period within which requests for registration may be given to the company) file with the commission the requisite registration statement to effect such registration and thereafter use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; provided, however, that the company may discontinue any registration of its securities which are not registrable securities (and, under the circumstances specified in section 2.2(a), its securities which are registrable securities) at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating thereto; (ii) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all registrable securities covered by such registration statement for such period as shall be required for the disposition of all of such registrable securities, provided, that in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.1 or 2.2, such period need not exceed 90 days; (iii) furnish to each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement, such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under rule 424 under the securities act, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request; (iv) use its best efforts (x) to register or qualify all registrable securities and other securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such states of the united states of america where an exemption is not available and as the sellers of registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall reasonably request, (y) to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains in effect, and (z) to take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such sellers to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities to be sold by such sellers, except that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this subdivision (iv) be obligated to be so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (v) use its best efforts to cause all registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other federal or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the company and counsel to the seller or sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities;

(vii) notify each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, in the judgment of the company, the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and at the request of any such seller promptly prepare and furnish to it a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, in the judgment of the company, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (viii) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen months, beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 promulgated thereunder, and promptly furnish to each such seller of registrable securities a copy of any amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus; (ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar (which, in each case, may be the company) for all registrable securities covered by such registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such registration; and (x) use its best efforts to list all registrable securities covered by such registration statement on any national securities exchange or national quotations system on which registrable securities of the same class covered by such registration statement are then listed. the company may require each seller of registrable securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish the company in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable such information regarding such seller and the distribution of such securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. each holder of registrable securities agrees by acquisition of such registrable securities that upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (vii) of this section 2.3, such holder will forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such registrable securities until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subdivision (vii) of this section 2.3 and, if so directed by the company, will deliver to the company (at the company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus relating to such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. 2.4. underwritten offerings. (a) requested underwritten offerings. if requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering by holders of registrable securities pursuant to a registration requested under section 2.1, the company will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the company, each such holder and the underwriters and to contain such representations and warranties by the company and such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type, including, without limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in section 2.7. the holders of the registrable securities proposed to be distributed by such underwriters will cooperate with the company in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement and will give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the company regarding the form thereof. such holders of registrable securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to such underwriting agreement and may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such holders of registrable securities and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders of registrable securities. any such holder of registrable securities shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's registrable securities, such holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations required by law. (b) incidental underwritten offerings. if the company proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act as contemplated by section 2.2 and such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters, the company will, subject to section 2.8 hereof, if requested by any requesting holder of registrable securities arrange for such underwriters to include all the registrable securities to be offered and sold by such requesting holder among the securities of the company to be distributed by such underwriters. the holders of registrable securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the company and such underwriters and may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such holders of registrable securities and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders of registrable securities. any such requesting holder of registrable securities shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such requesting holder, such requesting holder's registrable securities and such requesting holder's intended method of distribution or any other representations required by law. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 2.4(b), the company need not include any registrable securities of any such requesting holder in an underwritten offering of the company's securities if the inclusion of such requesting holder's securities, in the opinion of the managing underwriter for such offering by the company, might adversely affect such offering by the company. (c) holdback agreements. (i) in the case of any underwritten public offering by the company of shares of common stock, each holder of registrable securities agrees not to effect any disposition (other than a disposition of registrable securities under such underwritten public offering or a bona fide pledge or a disposition to an affiliate of such holder who agrees to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph) (a "disposition") of any registrable securities, and not to effect any such disposition of any other equity security of the company or of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the company (in each case, other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the 15 days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or such longer period as may be reasonably requested by the underwriter of such offering) beginning on, the effective date of such registration statement (except as apart of such registration), provided that each holder of registrable securities has received written notice of such registration at least 15 days prior to such effective date.

(a) the company shall be entitled to postpone for a reasonable period of time (but not exceeding 180 days, in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.1 or 2.2, and 30 days in the case of a registration pursuant to section 2.9) the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to section 2.1, if the company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration and offering (i) would interfere with any financing, acquisition, merger, consolidation, material joint venture, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the company or any of its affiliates, or (ii) would require premature disclosure of any of the foregoing transactions (or of the existence of negotiations, discussions or pending proposals with respect thereto) or of any pending or threatened litigation, claim, assessment or governmental investigation which would be material to the company, and promptly gives the holders of registrable securities requesting registration thereof pursuant to section 2.1 written notice of such delay. if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, such holders of registrable securities requesting registration thereof pursuant to section 2.1 shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the company within 30 days after receipt of the notice of postponement and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of the requests for registration to which holders of registrable securities are entitled pursuant to section 2.1 hereof. (b) the company shall not be obligated to effect the registration of registrable securities of any holder pursuant to section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.9 unless such holder consents to reasonable conditions imposed by the company, including without limitation: (i) conditions prohibiting the sale of shares by such holder until the registration shall have been effective for a specified period of time; (ii) conditions requiring such holder to comply with all prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act and with all anti-stabilization, anti-manipulation and similar provisions of section 10 of the exchange act and any rules issued thereunder by the commission, and to furnish to the company information about sales made in such public offering; (iii) conditions prohibiting such holder from effecting sale of shares upon receipt of telegraphic or written notice from the company (until further notice) given to permit the company to correct or update a registration statement or prospectus; and (iv) conditions requiring that at the end of the period during which the company is obligated to keep the registration statement effective under section 2.3(ii) or 2.9(c), such holder shall discontinue sales of shares pursuant to such registration statement upon receipt of notice from the company of its intention to remove from registration the shares covered by such registration statement that remain unsold, and requiring such holder to notify the company of the number of registrable securities registered that remain unsold promptly upon receipt of notice from the company. (c) holders of registrable securities shall use their reasonable best efforts to effect as wide a distribution of such registrable securities as reasonably practicable, and in no event shall any sale of registrable securities be made knowingly to (i) any person (including its affiliates) or (ii) any persons or entities which are to the knowledge of such holders (or to the knowledge of any underwriter for such holders) part of any "group" within the meaning of regulation 13d of the exchange act which includes such purchaser or any of its affiliates that, after giving effect to such sale, would beneficially own securities representing more than 5% of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the company. the holders of such registrable securities shall secure the agreement of their underwriter or underwriters, if any, for such offering to comply with the foregoing. 2.7. indemnification.

(b) indemnification by the sellers. as a condition to including any registrable securities in any registration statement, the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such registrable securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section 2.7) the company, and each director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the liability of such indemnifying party under this section 2.7(b) shall be limited to the amount of proceeds received by such indemnifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties is reasonably likely to exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defense thereof and the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party of such indemnified party's judgment and the basis therefor. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.7 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified party under subparagraph (a) or (b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under subparagraph (a) or (b) hereof, the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under subparagraph (a) or (b) hereof shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and the prospective sellers of registrable securities covered by the registration statement which resulted in such loss, claims, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and such prospective sellers from the offering of the securities covered by such registration statement. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. such prospective sellers' obligations to contribute as provided in this subparagraph (d) are several in proportion to the relative value of their respective registrable securities covered by such registration statement and not joint. in addition, no person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (e) other indemnification. indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each seller of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority other than the securities act. (f) indemnification payments. the indemnification and contribution required by this section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. in any case in which it shall be judicially determined that a party is not entitled to indemnification or contribution, any payments previously received by such party hereunder shall be promptly reimbursed. 2.8. limitations on registrations of registrable securities. (a) the company shall not be required to effect any registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2.1 prior to august 31, 1999 unless either (i) gecc shall have consented thereto in writing or (ii) (x) the offering price (net of underwriters' fees, commissions and discounts) pursuant to such registration results in a total return on investment of at least 40% per annum and (y) gecc is given the opportunity to include at least 50% of the registrable securities held by it in such registration. gecc shall have the right to require the withdrawal of any previously filed registration statement if it determines that the foregoing conditions will not be met.
