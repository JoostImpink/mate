use reasonable best efforts to deliver an irrevocable stockholder written consent (the &#147; written consent &#148;) executed by gary winemaster and kenneth winemaster, the issuer&#146;s majority controlling stockholders (the &#147; founding stockholders &#148;), consenting to the adoption of resolutions approving the conversion of the series b preferred stock into common stock, the issuance

pursuant to the purchase agreement, the issuer issued to weichai america 2,385,624 shares of series b preferred stock, with rights, preferences and designations set forth in a certificate of designation of series b convertible perpetual preferred stock (the &#147; certificate of designation &#148;) filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on march 30, 2017. effective as of the close of business on the effectiveness of the approval of the stockholder proposals which include proposals to issue common stock upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and exercise of the 2018 warrant and the additional warrant for purposes of nasdaq listing rule 5635 (the &#147; stockholder approval date &#148;), each share of series b preferred stock will automatically, without any action of the holder thereof, convert into a number of shares of common stock equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of such share of series b preferred stock (but excluding any accrued but unpaid dividends, which shall be cancelled upon such conversion) divided by the conversion price then in effect. the series b preferred stock is not otherwise convertible into shares of common stock. the conversion price of the series b preferred stock is initially equal to $8.00 per share of common stock (so each share of series b preferred stock initially converts into two shares of common stock). the conversion price of the series b preferred stock is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the payment of distributions payable in common stock; (ii) the issuance to all holders of common stock of certain options, warrants or other rights entitling them to subscribe for or purchase common stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other rights at a price per share of common stock less than 100% of the market value on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the issuer entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights; (iii) subdivisions, splits or reclassifications of the common stock into a greater number of common stock; (iv) distributions to all holders of outstanding common stock, including evidences of indebtedness, assets or securities, but excluding any dividends or distributions of options, warrants or other rights referred to in (i) or (ii) above, dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash; (v) dividends and distributions of capital stock or equity interests in connection with spin offs; and (vi) a tender or exchange offer that requires a payment in excess of the closing sales price for the common stock. prior to 180 days after the closing date (the &#147; accrual date &#148;), holders of the series b preferred stock will participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of common stock in all dividends on the shares of common stock on an as converted basis. commencing on the accrual date, holders of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends and if declared will be payable quarterly in cash on january 15, april 15, july 15 and october 15 of each year at the annual rate of 10% of the $16.00 per share liquidation preference. such dividends shall be declared and payable unless the issuer is not permitted to declare or pay such dividend or incur such liability either (x) as a matter of law or (y) under the terms of the issuer&#146;s debt financing agreements. in the event any dividends on the series b preferred stock are prohibited from being declared or paid by the issuer, all deferred dividends shall be payable on the first dividend payment date when the issuer is no longer being prohibited from doing so. the series b preferred stock contains limitations on the issuer&#146;s ability to pay distributions on its shares ranking, as to the payment of distributions or rights upon the issuer&#146;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with or junior to the series b preferred stock, including the common stock, for any period unless all accrued and unpaid dividends all have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or are declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment. in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the issuer, the holders of the series b preferred stock will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the issuer available for distribution to stockholders of the issuer, before any distributions on the common stock or any other junior stock, an amount equal to the greater of the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends, or the amount that would otherwise be payable on an as converted basis assuming the conversion of the series b preferred stock into common stock. if, upon the issuer&#146;s liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the assets are insufficient to make the full payment due to holders of the series b preferred stock, no distribution of assets shall be made on any junior stock, and no distribution shall be made in respect of any parity stock unless the series b preferred stock shares ratably in any such distribution. page 7 of 14 upon the election of the holder, the issuer is obligated to redeem the series b preferred stock at any time after march 31, 2018, first anniversary of the closing date, an obligation that will be extinguished upon the automatic conversion of the series b preferred stock into common stock on the stockholder approval date. pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the issuer must ensure that the stockholder proposal is approved by way of written consent of the issuer&#146;s stockholders within one hundred eighty (180) days following the closing date. in the event that the issuer is unable to obtain, as a matter of law, the approval of the stockholder proposal by written consent within one hundred eighty (180) days following closing date, at the request of weichai america, the issuer is required to immediately call and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of approving the stockholder proposal no less than once in each three (3)-month period beginning on the one hundred eightieth (180) days following closing date until the stockholder proposal has been duly approved. the holders of series b preferred stock do not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, except for voting rights required by law or those explicitly provided in the certificate of designations, which solely include voting rights with respect to (i) any amendment of the certificate of incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the holders with respect to series b preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, (ii) issuances or any class of securities that would have parity with or be senior to the series b preferred stock, or (iii) reclassifications of any authorized stock of the issuer into any parity stock or senior stock, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any senior stock. the warrants on march 31, 2017, pursuant to the purchase agreement, the issuer issued to weichai america the 2018 warrant, pursuant to which weichai america (including any permitted transferee or assignee of the 2018 warrant under the terms thereof) has the right to purchase from the issuer, the sum of (a) 4,055,709 shares of common stock, and (b) any additional shares of common stock so that after the full and complete exercise of the 2018 warrant (including the aggregate number of shares of common stock previously issued from time to time as a result of any partial exercise of the 2018 warrant), weichai america, together with all of its affiliates and all persons to which it or its affiliates have transferred any shares of common stock or series b preferred stock acquired under the purchase agreement, hold an aggregate number of shares of common stock (assuming the conversion of series b preferred stock into common stock as of such time of such exercise) equal to 51% of the common stock deemed outstanding on the date of final exercise of the warrant in full, subject to adjustment as provided therein. the 2018 warrant will become exercisable for a three-month period commencing upon the 18 month anniversary of the closing date, provided, however, that the 2018 warrant may become exercisable prior to such date to the extent that the issuer is in default under certain of its debt obligations and the issuer&#146;s lenders accelerate such obligations. the 2018 warrant will be exercisable at a price per share of common stock equal to 85% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock (&#147; vwap &#148;) during the 20 consecutive trading day period preceding the date of exercise, or 50% of such preceding vwap price if the issuer is delisted from nasdaq as of the 18 month anniversary of the closing date (and if the 2018 warrant is exercised prior to such date, the exercise price shall be appropriately adjusted depending on whether the issuer is or is not delisted from nasdaq on such date). the 2018 warrant exercise price is subject to further reduction pursuant to a formula that provides for such adjustment in case the issuer&#146;s 2017 adjusted ebitda is less than $22,000,000 or its net book value per share as of december 31, 2016 is less than $8.00 (in each case as determined from the issuer&#146;s audited financial statements for such fiscal years), provided that the aggregate amount of such downward adjustments in the 2018 warrant exercise price shall not exceed $15,000,000. if the stockholder proposal has not been approved prior to the exercise of the 2018 warrant, the 2018 warrant shall be exercisable for a number of shares of series b preferred stock (instead of common stock) which are convertible into the number of shares of common stock for which the 2018 warrant would otherwise be exercisable. in addition, if the issuer is obligated to issue shares to resolve a specified dispute following the 18 month anniversary of the closing date, the issuer will issue to weichai america an additional warrant (the &#147; additional warrant &#148;) to offset the dilutive effect of such issuance, and the terms of such additional warrant shall be similar to the terms of the 2018 warrant. page 8 of 14 investor rights agreement the investor rights agreement provides weichai america with representation on the issuer&#146;s board of directors (the &#147; board &#148;) and management representation rights. on the closing date, the issuer increased the size of its board to seven and appointed two individuals designated by weichai america to its board, one of whom is serving as the chairman of the board. thereafter, the rights agreement requires the issuer to nominate for election to the board three individuals designated by weichai america and use best efforts to cause their election in connection with each annual meeting of stockholders of the issuer. subject to applicable law and applicable stock exchange requirements, weichai america shall have the right to designate at least three (3) directors, two (2) directors or one (1) director, respectively, for election to the board for so long as it beneficially owns securities representing, in the aggregate, no less than 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, of the total outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully-diluted as-converted basis and excluding all issuer securities issued pursuant to certain exceptions as provided therein). upon the exercise of the 2018 warrant in full, and so long as weichai america beneficially owns at least 40% of the outstanding shares of common stock (calculated on a fully-diluted as-converted basis and excluding all issuer securities issued pursuant to certain exceptions as provided therein), the issuer shall cause the appointment to the board of one additional individual designated by weichai america, and weichai america shall thereafter have the right to nominate for election four directors or any additional number of designees necessary to ensure that its designees constitute the majority of the directors serving on the board. the issuer also agreed in the investor rights agreement, that during any period when the issuer is a &#147;controlled company&#148; within the meaning of the nasdaq listing rules, it will take such measures as to avail itself of the &#147;controlled company&#148; exemptions available to it under rule 5615 of the nasdaq listing rules of rules 5605(b), (d) and (e). pursuant to the management representation rights contained in the investor rights agreement, weichai america has the right to appoint an individual to serve in a management role as a vice president of the issuer (or such position with an equivalent role and title), and once appointed, such individual shall be primarily responsible for overseeing the collaboration between the issuer and weichai power under the collaboration agreement. the investor rights agreement also requires the issuer to promptly inform and consult with weichai america regarding the recruitment of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief operating officer of the issuer, and provides weichai america with the right to propose candidates for such positions. weichai america has certain governance rights under the investor rights agreement. the investor rights agreement requires the issuer to provide notice and consult with weichai america before taking any of the following actions: (a) creating, participating or terminating any partnership, joint venture, consortium or similar business arrangement, (b) approving the annual budget and business plan and material amendments thereof, (c) causing or permitting encumbrances except as contemplated in the approved annual budget plan, on assets with value not in excess of $500,000 or arising in the ordinary course of business under law, (d) appointing, removing or replacing any &#147;c-suite level&#148; executive and (e) approving, amending, modifying or terminating any employee equity incentive plans. following consultation with weichai america, the issuer is permitted to take the foregoing actions if approved by a majority of the board (including one director designated by weichai america). the following actions require the approval of weichai america or a director designated by weichai america: (i) declaration of dividends and other distributions, (ii) the creation of any new class of equity security, the repurchase, redemption or retirement of equity securities and the amendment of the rights, preferences and privileges of any equity security and (iii) the increase or decrease in the size of the board other than to increase the size to seven on the closing date as contemplated under the

(a) in the case of a spin-off, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders of the company entitled to receive such distribution shall be reduced by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the market value minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a board resolution) of the shares (or fractions thereof) of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of common stock and the denominator of which shall be the market value. any adjustment to the conversion price under this subparagraph (iv)(b) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth trading day from, and including, the effective date of the spin-off and (2) the date of the initial public offering of the securities being distributed in the spin-off, if that initial public offering is effected simultaneously with the spin-off. no adjustment to the conversion price shall be made if the holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to section 2. 7 (v) tender offers . in the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the company or any subsidiary of the company for all or any portion of the common stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of purchased shares) of aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a board resolution) per share of common stock that exceeds the closing sale price of the common stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the &#147; expiration time &#148;) tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the conversion price shall be reduced by multiplying the conversion price immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the expiration time by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the market value on the date of the expiration time and (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the expiration time, and (b) the denominator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (i) the market value on the date of the expiration time and (ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the expiration time less the number of all shares validly tendered or exchanged, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the expiration time (such validly tendered or exchanged shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the &#147; purchased shares &#148;) plus (y) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of purchased shares). (b) de minimis adjustments . notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this section 7 need be made to the conversion price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the conversion price then in effect. any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall result in an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of such conversion price. no adjustment under this section 7 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a conversion price that is less than the par value of the common stock.

(b) adjustment to the exercise price. (a) subject to the limitation set forth in section 3(b)(c) below, in the event that the company&#146;s 2017 ebitda is less than $22 million, the aggregate exercise price for the warrant shares shall be adjusted by deducting an amount derived from the following formula (&#147;ebitda adjustment amount&#148;): ebitda adjustment amount = $27.5 million &#150; (2017 ebitda &times; 1.25) (b) subject to the limitation set forth in section 3(b)(c) below, to the extent that the net book value per share of common stock as of december 31, 2016 (based on the audited consolidated balance sheet of the company and its subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016) (&#147;actual 2016 net book value per share&#147;) is less than $8.00, then the aggregate exercise price for the warrant shares shall be further adjusted by deducting an amount derived from the following formula (&#147;net book value adjustment amount&#148;): net book value adjustment amount = ($8.00 - actual 2016 net book value per share) &times; 7,500,000 provided that, if the actual 2016 net book value per share is equal to or greater than $8.00, there will be no adjustment. (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of the ebitda adjustment amount and the net book value adjustment amount (collectively, &#147;aggregate adjustment amount&#148;) shall not exceed $15 million. if the aggregate exercise price for the warrant shares is less than the aggregate adjustment amount, then following the full exercise of the warrant the company shall be liable to pay the shortfall between the aggregate exercise price for the warrant shares and the aggregate adjustment amount to the holder. in the event that either the 2017 ebitda or actual 2016 net book value per share is zero or a negative number, then 2017 ebitda or actual 2016 net book value per share, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be 0.01 for the purposes of calculation of the adjustments. (c) payment of additional amounts for warrant shares . in the event that the holder exercises all or any part of the warrant during the accelerated term for the exercise price pursuant to section 3(a)(x) or (y) and (i) there exists a delisting condition at the time of exercise of the warrant; but (ii) the company common stock is listed on nasdaq as of the date that is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing, the holder shall pay to the company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the company, promptly following the date that is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing, an additional amount equal to the quotient of (a) the aggregate exercise price paid in respect of all of the warrant shares exercised by the holder during the accelerated term, multiplied by (b) 0.7. in the event that (i) there is no delisting condition when the holder exercises the warrant during the accelerated term; and (ii) the company common stock is not listed on nasdaq as of the date that is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing, the company shall pay to the holder by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the holder, promptly following the date that is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing, an additional amount equal to the quotient of (a) the aggregate exercise price paid in respect of all of the warrant shares exercised by the holder during the accelerated term, multiplied by (b) 35/85.
