of the warrant (or any interest therein) or the sale of the warrant shares. 8.3 indemnification procedures. any person entitled to indemnification under this section 8 shall (a) give prompt written notice to the company of any claim with respect to which it is entitled to seek indemnification and (b) permit the company to assume the defense of such claim with counsel selected by the company and reasonably acceptable to such person; provided, however, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (i) the company has agreed to pay such fees or expenses; (ii) the company has failed to notify such person in writing within ten (10) days of its receipt of such written notice to the company that it will assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably acceptable to such person; or (iii) in the judgment of any such person, a conflict of interest exists between such person, on the one hand, and the company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the company in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the company, the company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person). the company will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnified party may, without the consent of the company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the company of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. 8.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to the purchaser or any other indemnified party in respect of any losses, then the company parties, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company parties, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, either any company party or such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. no person guilty of fraudulent 64 misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8.5 reimbursement of deal-related costs and expenses. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise,

direction, the company shall reimburse third party providers of the purchaser directly for all of such costs and expenses. in addition, the company parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the

reason. 8.6 costs of collection. the company parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the purchaser all costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of all attorneys, accountants and other experts retained by the purchaser, which are expended or incurred by or on behalf of the purchaser in connection with (a) the collection and enforcement of the obligations, whether or not any action, suit or other proceeding is commenced; (b) any actions for declaratory relief in any way related to the obligations; (c) the protection or preservation of any rights or remedies of the purchaser under this agreement or any other investment document; (d) any actions taken by the purchaser in negotiating any amendment, waiver, consent or release of or under this agreement, the notes or any other investment document; (e) any actions taken in reviewing the company's or any of its subsidiaries' financial affairs if any event of default has occurred or the purchaser has determined in good faith

of the company or any of its subsidiaries; and 65 (iv) undertake any other action which the purchaser believes is necessary to assess accurately the financial condition and prospects of the company and any of its subsidiaries; (f) any refinancing, restructuring (whether in the nature of a "work out" or otherwise), bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving the company or any of its respective

maintain, perfect and protect any lien granted to the purchaser by the company or any other person under the investment documents; or (h) any effort by the purchaser to protect, assemble, complete,

hand, or the company (for itself and the other company parties), on the other hand, if the closing date shall not have occurred on or before february 15, 2000; provided, however, that the right to terminate this agreement under this section 12.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the closing date to occur on or prior to such date; (c) by the purchaser, on the one hand, or the company (for itself and the other company parties), on the other hand, if there shall have been issued any injunction, order, decree or ruling that prohibits or limits any of the transactions contemplated by this agreement or the other investment documents and such injunction, order, decree or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable; (d) by the purchaser, if the purchaser decides at any time after the date hereof that it will not proceed with the

acquired by the holder with a fair market value equal to the warrant purchase price for the shares then being purchased or (v) any combination of the foregoing. the company shall issue fractional shares of common stock upon the exercise of this warrant. 3. anti-trust notification. if the company or the holder determines, in its sole judgment upon the advice of counsel, that an exercise of this

holder promptly (but in no event more than three (3) business days) such information and assistance as the holder may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any filing or submission required to be filed by the holder under the hsr act. the company shall respond promptly after receiving any inquiries or requests for additional information from the ftc or the doj (and in no event

with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the ftc or the doj. the company shall bear all filing or other fees required to be paid by the company and the holder (or the "ultimate parent entity" of the holder, if any) under the hsr act or any other applicable law in connection with such filings and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the company and the holder in connection with the preparation of such filings and responses to inquiries or 5 requests. in the event that this section 3 is applicable to any exercise of this warrant, the purchase by the holder of the warrant shares subject to the exercise notice, and the payment by the holder of the warrant purchase price, shall be subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the hsr act. 4. adjustments to the number of warrant shares and to the warrant purchase price. the number of warrant shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the warrant purchase price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this section 4. 4.1 stock dividends, subdivisions and combinations. if at any time the company: (a) pays a dividend or makes any other distribution with respect to its common stock in shares of common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock, (b) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares of common stock, or (c) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, then the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision or combination, as the case may be, shall be adjusted so that the holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this warrant the kind and number of shares of common stock that the holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive immediately after such record date or effective date, as the case may be, had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such record date or effective date. any adjustment made pursuant to this section 4.1 shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event, but be retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event. upon any adjustment to the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant as herein provided, the warrant purchase price per share shall be adjusted by multiplying the warrant purchase price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the number of warrant shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. 6 4.2 issuance of options. if at any time the company issues (without payment of any consideration) to all holders of outstanding common stock any options, the company shall also distribute such options to the holder as if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the effective date of such issuance. 4.3 distribution of assets or securities. if at any time the company makes a distribution to its stockholders (other than in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company) of any asset or security other than those referred to in sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.5, the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock on the date fixed for such determination, less the then fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment in the warrant purchase price as provided in this section 4.3, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.4 issuance of equity securities at less than fair market value. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.4(b), shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock without consideration or for a consideration per share that is less than either the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or sale or the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant purchase price shall be reduced (calculated to the nearest $.001 and without regard to any other provisions hereof) to an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (a) the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (2) the lesser of the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale and the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (b) the cash consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and 7 the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying (c) the number of shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) immediately after such sale or issuance, by (d) the lesser of the fair market value per share of common stock as of the date of such issuance or sale and the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (x) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.4(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of options. if the company in any manner issues or grants any options or convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than either the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or grant of such options or the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or grant of options, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of options or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of options shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such options, plus in the case of such options which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or 8 exchange price per share of common stock which is less than either the fair market value per share of common stock determined as of the date of such issuance or sale or the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (iii) change in equity price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock changes at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such change shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted. (iv) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.8(e). (v) treasury shares. the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time does not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the company, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or sale of common stock. 9 (vi) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (c) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.4 with respect to the issuance of excluded securities. 4.5 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. if at any time the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.6, and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) shares of capital stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company ("other property") are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder's rights under section 4.8(e). in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of 10 the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any shares of common stock of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.5. for purposes of this section 4, "common stock of the successor or acquiring person" shall include stock or other equity securities, or securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into equity securities, of such corporation, or other securities if such person is not a corporation, of any class that is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation or person and that is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.5 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets. 4.6 dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up. if at any time there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, total liquidation or winding-up of the company, other than as contemplated by section 4.5, then the company shall cause to be mailed (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) to the holder at the holder's address as shown on the warrant register, at the earliest practicable time (and, in any event, not less than thirty (30) calendar days before any date set for definitive action) written notice of the date on which such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up shall take place, as the case may be. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities, money or other property deliverable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be. on such date, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of this warrant the cash or other property, less the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, that the holder would have been entitled to receive had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. upon receipt of the cash or other property, any and all rights of the holder to exercise this warrant shall terminate in their entirety. if the cash or other property distributable in the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up has a fair market value which is less than the warrant purchase price for this warrant then in effect, this warrant shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. 4.7 other dilutive events. if any event occurs as to which the other provisions of this section 4 are not strictly applicable but as to which the failure to make any adjustment would not protect the purchase rights represented by this warrant in accordance with the intent and principles hereof, then, in each such case, the holder may appoint on behalf of the company an investment banking or accounting firm of recognized national standing which shall give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the 11 intent and principles established herein, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by this warrant. upon receipt of such opinion, the company will mail (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a copy thereof to the holder within three (3) business days and shall make the adjustments described therein. if an adjustment is made pursuant to this section 4.7, the fees and expenses of such investment banking or accounting firm shall be borne by the company. if, however, no adjustment is made, the holder shall bear such fees and expenses. 4.8 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the adjustments provided for pursuant to this section 4: (a) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring such an adjustment shall occur. for the purpose of any such adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (b) record date. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them to (i) receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or in shares of any other class or series of capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or shares of any other class or series of capital stock or (ii) subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or such other shares or securities, then all references in this section 4 to the date of the issuance or sale of such shares of common stock or such other shares or securities shall be deemed to be references to that record date. (c) when adjustment not required. if the company fixes a record date of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights to which the provisions of section 4.1 would apply, but shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (d) notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted or recalculated pursuant to this section 4, the company shall, as soon as practicable but in no event more than five (5) business days thereafter, prepare a certificate to be executed by the chief financial officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment or recalculation and the method by which such adjustment or recalculation was calculated, specifying the number of shares of common stock for which this 12 warrant is exercisable and (if such adjustment was made pursuant to section 4.5) describing the number and kind of any other shares of stock or other property for which this warrant is exercisable, and any related change in the warrant purchase price, after giving effect to such adjustment, recalculation or change. the company shall mail to the holder (by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid) a signed copy of such certificate prior to the end of the five (5) business day period referenced above. the company shall keep at the designated office copies of all such certificates and cause them to be available for inspection at the designated office during normal business hours by the holder or any prospective transferee of this warrant designated by the holder.

(d) reduction of offering. if the managing underwriter or underwriters for a demand registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the company and the demanding holders in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of registrable securities which the demanding holders desire to sell, taken together with all other shares of common stock or other securities which the company desires to sell and the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights, if any, which other shareholders of the company desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method or the probability of success of such offering (the "maximum number of shares"), then the company shall include in such registration: 4 (i) first, the registrable securities as to which demand registration has been requested by the demanding holders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of registrable securities held by each demanding holder, regardless of the number of shares of registrable securities which such demanding holder has requested be included in such registration) that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (ii) second, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the shares of common stock or other securities that the company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (iii) third, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) above, the shares of common stock for the account of other shareholders of the company that the company is obligated to register (to be allocated among the persons requesting inclusion in such registration pursuant to such agreements pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of common stock with respect to which such persons has the right to request such inclusion under such agreements, regardless of the number of shares which such person has actually requested be included in such registration) that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares, to the extent that the company is contractually permitted as of the date hereof to "cutback" such shares; and (iv) fourth, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the shares of common stock that other shareholders desire to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares. (e) withdrawal. at any time prior to the effectiveness of a registration statement with the commission, the demanding holders or any one of them may withdraw their registrable securities from any proposed offering being effected pursuant to a demand registration by giving written notice to the company of their election to withdraw prior to the filing of the registration statement. if the demanding holders so withdraw their registrable securities from such proposed offering, the withdrawing demanding holders shall not be obligated to pay any of the expenses incurred in connection with such registration statement and no demand registration shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of section 2.1(a). 5 2.2 piggy-back registration. (a) piggy-back rights. if at any time or from time to time the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of common stock by the company for its own account or by shareholders of the company for their own account (or by the company and by shareholders of the company) (other than a registration statement (i) on form s-4 or s-8 (or any substitute or successor form that may be adopted by the commission), (ii) filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (iii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the company's existing shareholders or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan), the company shall (x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of registrable securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than thirty (30) days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, of the offering; and (y) offer to the holders of registrable securities in such notice the opportunity to register such number of shares of registrable securities as such holders may request in writing within fifteen (15) days following receipt of such notice (a "piggy-back registration"). the company shall cause such registrable securities to be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the registrable securities requested to be included in a piggy-back registration to be included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. (b) reduction of offering. if the managing underwriter or underwriters for a piggy-back registration that is to be an underwritten offering of shares for the company's account advises the company and the holders of registrable securities in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of common stock which the company desires to sell, taken together with the registrable securities as to which registration has been requested hereunder and the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights which other shareholders of the company desire to sell, exceeds the maximum number of shares, then the company shall include in such registration: (i) first, the shares of common stock or other securities that the company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares; (ii) second, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i) above, the registrable securities as to which registration has been or may be requested under this section 2.2; and 6 (iii) third, to the extent the maximum number of shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) above, the shares of common stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the piggy-back registration rights which such other shareholders desire to sell that can be sold without exceeding the maximum number of shares. (c) withdrawal. at any time prior to the effectiveness of a registration statement with the commission, any holder of registrable securities may withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of registrable securities in any piggy-back registration by giving written notice to the company of its election to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. the company may also elect to withdraw a registration statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the company shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of registrable securities in connection with such piggy-back registration as provided in section 3.3. 2.3 registrations on form s-3. if the registration of registrable securities is permitted to be made on a registration statement on form s-3 (or any similar short-form registration which may be available at such time) (a "form s-3"), the holders of registrable securities may at any time request in writing that the company register the resale of any or all of its or their registrable securities on a form s-3 (provided, however, that if the company does not have a form s-3 then on file with the commission pursuant to this section 2.3, the company may postpone for not more than ninety (90) days, on one occasion only with respect to any requested registration under this section 2.3, the filing of a form s-3 if the company advises the holders in writing that it is engaged in a major corporate transaction that would be adversely affected by such filing). upon receipt of a written request for registration of registrable securities on form s-3 (a "form s-3 notice"), the company will promptly (but not later than three (3) business days after receipt of such form s-3 notice) furnish written notice of the proposed registration to all other holders of registrable securities, if any. the company shall cause to be filed with the commission, as soon as practicable after receipt of a form s-3 notice but not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, a form s-3 covering all of such holder's or holders' registrable securities as specified in the form s-3 notice and all of the registrable securities of any other holders who join in such request as specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the company. in addition, the company shall use its best efforts to cause each such form s-3 to become effective as soon as practicable but not later than ninety (90) days after the date of receipt by the company of the relevant form s-3 notice. the company shall use its best efforts to maintain each form s-3 continuously effective, supplemented and amended until the registrable securities covered thereby have been sold. no registration effected pursuant to this section 2.3 shall be counted as a demand registration effected pursuant to section 2.1. the registration rights provided to the holders of registrable securities hereunder shall survive until the third anniversary of the date upon which the first form s-3 filed with the commission hereunder is declared effective by the commission. 7 2.4 purchase (and exercise) of the warrant by the underwriters. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary, in connection with any demand registration or piggy-back registration which is to be an underwritten offering, to the extent all or any portion of the registrable securities to be included in such registration consist of warrant shares, the holders of such registrable securities may request that the underwriter or underwriters purchase (and exercise) the warrant or any portion thereof rather than require the holders of the registrable securities to exercise the warrant or portion thereof in connection with such registration, unless the underwriters inform such holders that such a purchase and exercise of the warrant will materially and adversely affect the proposed offering. the company shall take all such action and provide all such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the holders of registrable securities to facilitate any such purchase (and exercise) of the warrant agreed to by the underwriter or underwriters, including, without limitation, issuing the warrant shares or any portion thereof to be issued within such time period as will permit the underwriters to make and complete the distribution contemplated by the underwriting. 3. registration procedures. 3.1 filings; information. whenever the company is required to effect the registration of any registrable securities pursuant to section 2, the company shall use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) filing registration statement. the company shall, as expeditiously as possible, prepare and file with the commission, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.1, a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of all registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof, and shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period required by section 3.1(c); provided, however, that the company shall have the right to defer such registration for up to ninety (90) days if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president and chief executive officer of the company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be materially detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time; provided further, however, that in the event the company elects to exercise such right with respect to any registration, it shall not have the right to exercise such right again prior to the date which is twelve (12) months after the date on which the registration statement relating to such deferred registration is declared effective. 8 (b) copies. the company shall, prior to filing a registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the holders of registrable securities included in such registration, and such holders' legal counsel, copies of such registration statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such registration statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents as the holders of registrable securities included in such registration or legal counsel for any such holders may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such holders. (c) amendments and supplements. the company shall prepare and file with the commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and in compliance with the provisions of the securities act until all registrable securities and other securities covered by such registration statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution set forth in such registration statement (which period shall not exceed, in each case other than a form s-3, the sum of one hundred twenty (120) days plus any period during which any such disposition is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or any governmental agency or court) or such securities have been withdrawn.

(e) state securities laws compliance. the company shall use its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the registrable securities covered by the registration statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as the holders of registrable securities included in such registration statement (in light of their intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) cause such registrable securities covered by the registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of registrable securities included in such registration statement to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 3.1(e), or subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction. (f) agreements for disposition. the company shall enter into customary agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities. the representations, warranties and covenants of the company in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders of registrable securities included in such registration statement. no holder of registrable securities included in such registration statement shall be required to make any representations or warranties in the underwriting agreement except, if applicable, with respect to such holder's organization, good standing, authority, title to registrable securities, lack of conflict of such sale with such holder's material agreements and organizational documents, and with respect to written information relating to such holder that such holder has furnished in writing expressly for inclusion in such registration statement. (g) cooperation. the company shall cause the president and chief executive officer of the company, the chief financial officer of the company, any vice president of the company and any other members of the management of the company to cooperate fully in any offering of registrable securities hereunder, which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the preparation of the registration statement with respect to such offering and all other offering materials and related documents, and participation in meetings with underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential investors.

and the company shall promptly, but in no event more than five (5) business days after request for payment, pay directly or reimburse each llcp indemnified party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such llcp indemnified party in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company, in writing, by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein. the company also shall indemnify any underwriter of the registrable securities, their officers, affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification provided above in this section 4.1. 4.2 indemnification by holders of registrable securities. each selling holder of registrable securities will, in the event that any registrable securities held by such selling holder as to which any registration is being effected under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (severally and not jointly) the company, each of its directors and officers and each underwriter (if any), and each other person, if any, who controls such selling holder or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to the registration statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein, and shall, within five (5) business days after a request therefor, reimburse the company, its directors and officers, and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of registrable securities be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities. 13 4.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings. promptly after receipt by any person of any written notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the "indemnified party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to such indemnified party hereunder, except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure. if the indemnified party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other indemnifying parties, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that in any action in which both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party are named as defendants, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the indemnified party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the indemnified party against the indemnifying party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such indemnifying party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. 4.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in the foregoing sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified parties and the indemnifying parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of any indemnified party and any indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnified 14 party or such indemnifying party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of registrable securities be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5. underwriting and distribution. 5.1 rule 144. the company covenants that it shall file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and shall take such further action as the holders of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. 5.2 restrictions on sale by the company and others. the company agrees that (a) it will not effect any public sale or distribution of any securities similar to those being registered in accordance with section 2.1, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the ninety (90) days prior to, and during the one hundred eighty (180) day period commencing on, the effective date of any demand registration (except as part of such demand registration to the extent permitted by section 2.1(d)); and (b) any agreement entered into after the date hereof pursuant to which the company issues or agrees to issue any privately placed securities shall contain a provision under which holders of such securities agree not to effect any sale or distribution of any such securities during the periods described in (a) above, in each case including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of any such registration, if permitted); provided, however, that the provisions of this section 5.2 shall not prevent the conversion or exchange of any securities pursuant to their terms into or for other securities and shall not prevent the issuance of securities by the company under any employee benefit, stock option or stock subscription plans. 15 6. miscellaneous. 6.1 other registration rights. (a) the company hereby represents and warrants to llcp that no person has any right to require the company to register any shares of the capital stock of the company for sale or to include any shares of the capital stock of the company in any registration filed by the company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of any other person. (b) from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of llcp, (i) enter into any agreement granting any demand registration right (i.e., the right to require the company to register the sale of any shares of the company's capital stock), (ii) enter into any agreement granting any piggy-back registration right (i.e., the right to require the company to register the sale of any shares of the company's capital stock in any registration filed by the company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of any other person) which is inconsistent with, equal to or superior to any registration rights granted hereunder or (iii) enter into any agreement that adversely affects the rights granted to the holders of registrable securities hereunder. 6.2 successors and assigns. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. the rights and obligations of llcp under this agreement shall be freely assignable in whole or in part. each such assignee, by accepting such assignment of the rights of the assignor hereunder, shall be deemed to have agreed to and be bound by the obligations of the assignor hereunder. the rights and obligations of the company hereunder may not be assigned or delegated. 6.3 notices. all notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if transmitted by telecopier with
