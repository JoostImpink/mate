or (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violating with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on december 30, 1996, rhi acquired 250,000 units (as described below) at an aggregate purchase price of $750,000. the source of the funds was from rhi's working capital. any additional shares of issuer common stock or warrants to be purchased by rhi would be purchased with rhi's working capital. page 3 of 8 pages item 4. purpose of transaction. rhi entered into the transactions described below for investment purposes. the reporting persons may from time to time consider various alternatives with respect to their investment in issuer. none of the reporting persons currently has plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the matters described in subparagraphs (b), (c) or any of (e) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. except as set forth below, none of the reporting persons currently has plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the matters described in subparagraphs (a) or (d) of item 4 of schedule 13d. pursuant to a purchase agreement dated as of december 27, 1996 (the "purchase agreement") between issuer and rhi, rhi purchased 250,000 units at a price of $3.00 per unit. each unit consists of one share of issuer common stock and one warrant to purchase issuer common stock. each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase, initially, one share of issuer common stock at a price, initially, of $3.00 per share. the purchase agreement provides that rhi may purchase from issuer an additional 250,000 units on or prior to january 31, 1997, an additional 166,667 units on or prior to february 28, 1997 and an additional 833,333 on or prior to may 29, 1997, at a purchase price of $3.00 per unit; provided, however, that issuer may, at its sole discretion, terminate such right of rhi at any time in whole or in part. issuer has the option to repurchase (the "repurchase option"), at any time on or prior to may 29, 1997, all (but not less than all) of the units purchased by rhi and held by rhi at such time at the prices set forth in section 2 of the purchase agreement. if issuer does not exercise the repurchase option, rhi will have the option (the "special option") to purchase such number of additional units (at $3.00 per unit) from issuer as would result in rhi having purchased an aggregate of 666,667 units under the purchase agreement. the purchase agreement provides that issuer shall use its best efforts to cause the board of directors of issuer to include at least 1 member designated by rhi so long as rhi owns capital stock (or rights to purchase capital stock) comprising 5% or more of the voting power in issuer and at least 2 members designated by rhi so long as rhi owns capital stock (or rights to purchase capital stock) comprising 10% or more of the voting power in issuer. page 4 of 8 pages in addition, pursuant to an option agreement dated as of december 27, 1996 (the "option agreement") between rhi and shared technologies fairchild inc., a delaware corporation ("stfi"), rhi purchased for $5,000 an option (the "series b option") to purchase from stfi (at an aggregate purchase price of $2,495,000) 250,000 shares of series b convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "issuer series b preferred"), of issuer and related rights of stfi under a certain stock purchase agreement dated as of august 19, 1996 (the "stfi stock purchase agreement") between issuer and stfi and under an equity holders agreement dated as of august 19, 1996 among international capital partners, inc. and its affiliates, zesiger capital group llc and stfi. the series b option expires on june 4, 1997 unless rhi exercises the special option. stfi is obligated to repurchase the series b option if issuer exercises the repurchase option. each share of issuer series b preferred is convertible into a minimum of 2-1/2 shares of issuer common stock and a maximum of 3-1/3 shares of issuer common stock (the conversion rate is based on the market price of the issuer common stock). the stfi stock purchase agreement provides that upon conversion of any issuer series b preferred into issuer common stock, issuer shall issue a warrant entitling the holder to purchase such number of shares of issuer common stock equal to the number of shares issued to such holder upon such conversion. the stfi stock purchase agreement provides that stfi shall be entitled to designate at least one member of issuer's board of directors so long as stfi owns capital stock (or rights to purchase capital stock) comprising more than 5% of the voting power in issuer. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) the reporting persons beneficially own an aggregate of 500,000 shares of issuer common stock, including 250,000 shares with respect to which rhi has warrants to purchase but has not yet purchased. based upon issuer's representation in the purchase agreement that there were 4,606,184 shares of issuer common stock outstanding at december 27, 1996, the reporting persons' beneficial ownership represents 9.79% of the issuer common stock. if the reporting persons are deemed to beneficially own all of the issuer common stock that it has contingent rights to purchase under the purchase agreement and the option agreement (and the various warrants issuable pursuant thereto), the reporting persons would beneficially own 4,428,572 shares of issuer common stock (after giving effect to page 5 of 8 pages the conversion of issuer series b preferred at midpoint of the conversion rate collar), or 49.02% of the issuer common stock. in addition, rhi owns 6,200,000 shares of common stock of stfi (the "stfi common stock") and 250,000 shares of stfi's 6% cumulative preferred stock, which shares are convertible into 3,921,568 shares of stfi common stock. based upon stfi's representation that there were 15,685,269 shares of stfi common stock outstanding at january 15, 1997, the reporting persons' beneficial ownership of 10,121,568 shares of stfi common stock constitutes approximately 51.62% of the stfi common stock (39.53% without giving effect to conversion of the stfi 6% cumulative preferred stock). jeffrey steiner, the chairman, chief executive officer, president and 38.8% beneficial owner of tfc, is vice-chairman of the stfi board of directors. donald miller, general counsel of tfc, and natalia hercot, daughter of mr. steiner and an employee of tfc, are also members of the 13-member stfi board of directors. by virtue of rhi's share ownership in stfi and tfc's representation on the stfi board of directors, the reporting persons may be deemed to beneficially own the 3,260,642 shares of issuer common stock beneficially owned by stfi (which number gives effect to the conversion of 250,000 shares of issuer series b preferred owned by stfi at midpoint of the conversion rate range into 714,286 shares of issuer common stock and the exercise of warrants to purchase a like number of issuer common stock). if the reporting persons are deemed to beneficially own all of the issuer common stock beneficially owned by stfi and to beneficially own all of the issuer common stock that it has contingent rights to purchase under the purchase agreement and the option agreement (and the various warrants issuable pursuant thereto), the reporting persons would beneficially own 6,260,642 shares of issuer common stock (after giving effect to the conversion of issuer series b preferred at midpoint of the conversion rate collar), or 69.3% of the issuer common stock. jeffrey steiner, as a result of his 38.8% beneficial ownership in tfc and his position as chairman, chief executive officer and president of tfc, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 500,000 shares of issuer common stock beneficially owned by the reporting persons. mr. steiner disclaims such beneficial ownership, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein. page 6 of 8 pages (b) the information required by this paragraph is set forth in items 7 through 11 of the cover page of this schedule.
