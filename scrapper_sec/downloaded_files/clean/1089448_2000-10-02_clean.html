(b) in the event a meeting of the servicesoft stockholders is held to approve this agreement and the merger (the "servicesoft stockholders meeting"), then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, servicesoft may adjourn or postpone the servicesoft stockholders meeting if as of the time for which the servicesoft stockholders meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of servicesoft capital stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the servicesoft stockholders meeting, in which case the servicesoft stockholders meeting shall be re-convened as soon as a quorum is available. servicesoft shall ensure that the servicesoft stockholders meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted prior to and separate from any meeting of the servicesoft stockholders at which any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction (as defined in section 6.6(a)) is considered or voted upon. (c) subject to section 6.5(d): (i) the board of directors of servicesoft shall unanimously recommend that the servicesoft stockholders approve this agreement and the merger; (ii) the form s-4 and prospectus/proxy statement, and the written consent of stockholders, if any, shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of servicesoft has recommended that the servicesoft stockholders approve this agreement and the merger; and (iii) neither the board of directors of servicesoft nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to broadbase, the recommendation of the board of directors of servicesoft that the servicesoft stockholders vote in favor of and approve this agreement and the merger.

(a) definitions. (i) "acquisition proposal" means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by broadbase) relating to an acquisition transaction with respect to servicesoft.

(b) from and after the date of this agreement until the effective time or termination of this agreement pursuant to article 11, servicesoft and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly: 39 45 (i) solicit, or initiate the making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal; (ii) furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to any acquisition proposal or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries regarding any acquisition proposal; (iii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any acquisition proposal, except that servicesoft may inform third parties, in response to unsolicited inquiries, of the existence of these provisions; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal (except, in the case of a superior offer, if (1) neither servicesoft nor any representative of servicesoft and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this section 6.6 and (2) the board of directors of servicesoft concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it must approve, endorse or recommend such superior offer in order for it to comply with its fiduciary obligations to servicesoft's stockholders under applicable law); or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any acquisition transaction; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of this agreement and the merger at the servicesoft stockholders' meeting, this section 6.6(b) shall not prohibit servicesoft from furnishing nonpublic information regarding servicesoft and its subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or group who has submitted (and not withdrawn) to servicesoft an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal that the board of directors of servicesoft reasonably concludes (based on the written advice of a financial advisor of national standing) may constitute a superior offer if (1) neither servicesoft nor any representative of servicesoft and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this section 6.6, (2) the board of directors of servicesoft concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the board of directors of servicesoft to comply with its fiduciary obligations to servicesoft's stockholders under applicable law, (3) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any such discussions with, such person or group, servicesoft gives broadbase written notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal and of servicesoft's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group, and servicesoft receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to servicesoft's confidential information as the confidentiality agreement entered into by the parties hereto, (4) servicesoft gives broadbase at least two business days advance notice of its intent to furnish such nonpublic information or enter into such discussions, and (5) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person or group, servicesoft furnishes such nonpublic information to broadbase (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by servicesoft to broadbase). servicesoft and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any acquisition proposal. without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer, director or employee of servicesoft or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of servicesoft or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this section 6.6 by servicesoft; provided that if such violation consists of a communication by any such advisor which was unauthorized by servicesoft and servicesoft terminates its relationship with such advisor and with such advisor's employer immediately upon becoming aware of such communication, then such from and after such termination, then such 40 46 communication shall no longer be deemed to constitute a material breach of this agreement for purposes of sections 10.2 and 11.1(a)(ii). (c) in addition to the obligations of servicesoft set forth in section 6.6(b), servicesoft as promptly as practicable shall advise broadbase orally and in writing of any request for non-public information or any other inquiry which servicesoft believes is likely to lead to an acquisition proposal or of any acquisition proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, inquiry or acquisition proposal, and the identity of the person or group making any such request, inquiry or acquisition proposal. servicesoft will keep broadbase informed as promptly as practicable in all material respects of amendments to any such request, inquiry or acquisition proposal. 6.7 regulatory approvals. servicesoft will execute and file, or join in the execution and filing, of any application or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or consent of any governmental body, federal, state, local or foreign, which may be reasonably

assist broadbase in obtaining all such authorizations, approvals and consents. 6.8 necessary consents. servicesoft will use all reasonable efforts to obtain such written consents and take such other

writing promptly after learning of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation threatened or pending for the purpose or with the probable effect of enjoining or preventing the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, or which would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on broadbase. if servicesoft becomes subject to a review by the internal revenue service or any other taxing agency or authority for accounting periods prior to the closing date (including but not limited to any short tax year resulting from the merger),

broadbase shall confer and work together in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements for employees of servicesoft and its subsidiaries following the merger. servicesoft shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate such servicesoft employee plans as are requested by broadbase to be terminated, provided that those employees of servicesoft and its subsidiaries who are eligible to participate in each such servicesoft employee plan shall be provided the opportunity to participate in a substantially comparable employee benefit plan maintained by broadbase and provided further that broadbase requests such termination no 41 47 later than ten days prior to the closing date. servicesoft agrees that it shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, retention and salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements (other than the employment agreements) prior to the closing. 6.13 notification of employee problems.

such conversion or exercise), servicesoft will provide broadbase with such information and documents as broadbase may from time to time reasonably request with respect to the calculations of antidilution adjustments, dividends and share and warrant issuances that are reflected in the servicesoft disclosure letter. if, prior to the effective time, any person shall notify servicesoft of its election to exercise any warrants or convert any convertible securities of servicesoft, or exchange any servicesoft canada preferred stock or servicesoft canada common stock for servicesoft capital stock, in each case where the terms of such exercise or conversion would give effect to any antidilution 42 48 adjustments or dividends by servicesoft, or where the number of shares to be issued upon such exercise or conversion would differ from the number set forth or reflected in the servicesoft disclosure letter, then servicesoft shall notify broadbase in writing of such exercise, conversion or

(b) in the event that this agreement is terminated by servicesoft under section 11.1(a)(ii) or by either broadbase or servicesoft under section 11.1(a)(vi), broadbase shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay servicesoft a fee equal to $12.5 million in immediately available funds (the "broadbase termination fee"); provided, however, that in the case of termination pursuant to section 11.1(a)(ii), such payment shall be made only if (1) following the date of this agreement and prior to the termination of this agreement, a person has publicly announced an acquisition proposal and (2) within nine months following the termination of this agreement, either an acquisition transaction is consummated, or broadbase enters into an agreement providing for an acquisition transaction. if any principal or interest under any of the loans contemplated by section 7.12 remain outstanding, then the broadbase termination fee payable by broadbase pursuant to this section 11.4(b) shall be reduced by the amount of the outstanding loans owed by servicesoft. in addition, in the event that (1) this agreement is terminated by broadbase or servicesoft under section 11.1(a)(vi) and (2) either (x) the form s-4 and the prospectus/proxy statement did not include, pursuant to section 7.5 of this agreement, a statement to the effect that broadbase's 55 61 board of directors has recommended that broadbase stockholders vote in favor of the broadbase stockholder approvals or (y) the board of directors of broadbase (or a committee thereof) shall have withdrawn, amended or modified, in a manner adverse to servicesoft, the recommendation of the board of directors of broadbase that the stockholders of broadbase vote in favor of the broadbase stockholder proposals, then the outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, the loans shall be immediately deemed to have been repaid in full and all remaining amounts available with respect to the loans shall be paid to servicesoft at such time as the payment of the broadbase termination fee, without any recourse to, or further obligation on the part of, servicesoft. (c) each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this section 11.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this agreement. accordingly, if any party hereto fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this section 11.4, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party makes a claim that results in a judgment against the breaching party for the amounts set forth in this section 11.4, the breaching party shall pay to the other party such other party's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this section 11.4 at the prime rate of the chase manhattan bank in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. absent a willful breach of this agreement, any servicesoft termination fee or broadbase termination fee paid pursuant to this section 11.4 shall be the sole liability of the paying party. 12. survival of representations, indemnification and remedies, continuing covenants 12.1 survival of representations. all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of broadbase and servicesoft contained in this agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the parties to this agreement, until the earlier of the termination of this agreement and the expiration of the escrow period, whereupon such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will expire. 12.2 agreement to indemnify. subject to the limitations set forth in this article 12, the servicesoft stockholders will severally indemnify and hold harmless broadbase and its officers, directors, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control broadbase within the meaning of the securities act (hereinafter referred to individually as an "indemnified person" and collectively as "indemnified persons") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of actions, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and costs (hereinafter referred to as "damages") directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from: (a) any misrepresentation or breach of or default in connection with any of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants given or made by servicesoft in this agreement or any certificate, document or instrument delivered by or on behalf of servicesoft pursuant hereto; (b) any excess expenses; or (c) any failure of each servicesoft stockholder to have good, valid and marketable title to the issued and outstanding servicesoft capital stock identified in schedule 1 to such servicesoft stockholder's letter of transmittal, free and clear of all liens, claims, pledges, options, adverse claims, assessments or charges of any nature whatsoever ("ownership losses"); provided, however, that for purposes of the foregoing clause (c), the indemnified person may only seek and recover damages from the servicesoft stockholder who failed to have good, valid and marketable 56 62 title to such shares of servicesoft capital stock free and clear of all liens, claims, pledges, options, adverse claims, assessments or charges. 12.3 limitations on liability; exceptions.

(b) threshold. except for indemnification with respect to excess expenses, the indemnification provided for in this article 12 shall not apply unless and until the aggregate damages for which one or more indemnified persons seeks indemnification exceeds $1,000,000, in which event the indemnification provided for in this article 12 will include the aggregate of all damages; provided, however, that this section 12.3(b) shall not apply to liability or indemnification obligations of the servicesoft stockholders with respect to any matter or claim described in section 12.2(b).
