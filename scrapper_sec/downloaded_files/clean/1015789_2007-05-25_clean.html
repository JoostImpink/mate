(now proelite.com, a wholly owned subsidiary of real sport, inc.) entered into a term credit agreement with the hunter fund, an affiliated entity of the placement agent hunter world markets, inc., for a $600,000 term loan with a maturity date of up to one year from the date of issuance. this loan was secured by all of i-fight's assets. pursuant to the agreement, i-fight obtained a bridge loan of
