(e) all warrants delivered for exercise shall be canceled by the company. 2.2 payment of taxes. all shares of warrant stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant pursuant to the terms hereof shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, issued without violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any stockholder of the company and free and clear of all liens. the company shall pay all expenses in connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect to, the issue or delivery thereof unless such tax or charge is imposed by law upon the holder. the company shall not be required to pay any tax or governmental charge which may be issuable upon exercise of this warrant payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of warrant stock in a name other than that of the holder of the warrants to be exercised, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the company the amount of any such tax, or has established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid.. 2.3 fractional shares. the company shall not be required to issue a fractional share of warrant stock upon exercise of any warrant. as to any fraction of a share that the holder of one or more warrants, the rights under which are exercised in the same transaction, would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the company shall pay to such 8 holder an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of one share of common stock on the exercise date. 3. transfer, division and combination 3.1 compliance with securities act. the holder, by acceptance hereof, agrees and, represents that it will comply in all respects with the provisions of this section 3.1 and further agrees and represents that this warrant and the warrant stock to be issued upon exercise hereof are being acquired for investment for its own account and that such holder will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of this warrant or any warrant stock to be issued upon exercise hereof except under circumstances that will not result in a violation of the securities act nor applicable state securities laws. this warrant and all shares of warrant stock issued upon exercise of this warrant (unless registered under the securities act) shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate (including any securities issuable upon exercise of the securities represented by this certificate) have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), or applicable state securities laws and may not be sold or transferred unless (i) a registration statement covering such shares is effective under the act or (ii) the transaction is exempt from registration under the act and applicable state securities laws. in addition, in connection with the issuance of this warrant, the holder specifically represents to the company by acceptance of this warrant as follows: (a) the holder represents that it has received all the information it considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to acquire the warrant and the warrant stock to be issued upon exercise hereof. the holder further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the company regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the warrant and the warrant stock and the business, properties, prospects and financial condition of the company. the foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the company in this warrant or the right of the holder to rely thereon. (b) the holder understands that the securities it is purchasing are characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without registration under the securities act, only in certain limited circumstances. in addition, the holder represents that it is familiar with sec rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the securities act. 9 (c) the holder is an investor that can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the warrant and the warrant stock. the holder also represents it has not been organized solely for the purpose of acquiring the warrant and the warrant stock. 3.2 transfer. no transfer of any warrant shall be permitted unless such transfer is of a warrant representing the right to acquire warrant stock attributable to at least 2.5% of the warrant stock subject to the original warrants. each new certificate evidencing the warrant and/or warrant stock so transferred shall bear the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in section 3.1 hereof, except that such certificate shall not bear such restrictive legend, if, in the opinion of counsel for the company, such legend is not required in order to establish or assist in compliance with any provisions of the securities act or any applicable state securities laws. upon compliance with the provisions of this section 3.2, each transfer of this warrant and all rights hereunder, in whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this warrant at the designated office and compliance with the terms hereof, together with a written assignment of this warrant in the form of annex b hereto duly executed by the holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes described in section 2.2 in connection with the making of such transfer. upon such compliance, surrender and delivery and, if required, such payment, the company shall execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new warrant evidencing the portion of this warrant not so assigned and this warrant shall promptly be cancelled. 3.3 mutilation or loss. upon receipt by the company from any holder of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant and an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the company (it being understood that the written indemnification agreement and an affidavit of loss of the holder reasonably acceptable to the company shall be a sufficient indemnity and no posting of a surety bond will be required) and, in case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation hereof, the company will execute and deliver in lieu hereof a new warrant of like tenor to such holder; provided, however, that, in the case of mutilation, no indemnity shall be required if this warrant in identifiable form is surrendered to the company for cancellation. 3.4 division and combination. subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of this warrant, this warrant may be divided or combined with other like warrants upon presentation hereof at the designated office, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new warrants are to be issued, signed by the holder or its agent or attorney. subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of this warrant as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or combination, the company shall execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in exchange for the warrant or warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. 3.5 expenses. the company shall prepare, issue and deliver at its own expense any new warrant or warrants required to be issued hereunder. 10 3.6 maintenance of books. the company agrees to maintain, at the designated office, books for the registration and transfer of the warrants. 4. antidilution provisions the number of shares of warrant stock for which this warrant is exercisable and the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this section 4. 4.1 upon issuance of common stock. if the company shall, at any time or from time to time after the original issue date, issue any shares of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities without consideration or for consideration per share less than either (x) the dilution price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such common stock or securities or (y) the fair market value per share of the common stock immediately prior to such issuance, if such fair market value is greater than the dilution price, then such exercise price shall forthwith be lowered to a price equal to the price obtained by multiplying: (i) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such common stock, options, rights or securities by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the numerator shall be the sum of (i) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately prior to such issuance and (ii) the number of additional shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration for the number of shares of common stock so offered would purchase at the greater of the dilution price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or the fair market value per share of common stock and (y) the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after such issuance. 4.2 upon acquisition of common stock. if the company or any subsidiary shall, at any time or from time to time after the original issue date, directly or indirectly, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, for a consideration per share (plus, in the case of such options, rights, or securities, the additional consideration required to be paid to the company upon exercise, conversion or exchange) greater than the fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to such event, then the exercise price shall forthwith be lowered to a price equal to the price obtained by multiplying: (i) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such event by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the denominator shall be the fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to such event and (y) the numerator shall be the result of dividing: 11 (a) (1) the product of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and (b) the fair market value per share of common stock, in each case immediately prior to such event, minus (2) the aggregate consideration paid by the company in such event (plus, in the case of such options, rights, or convertible or exchangeable securities, the aggregate additional consideration required to be paid to the company upon exercise, conversion or exchange), by (b) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after such event. 4.3 provisions applicable to adjustments. for the purposes of any adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, the following provisions shall be applicable: (i) in the case of the issuance of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the non-cash consideration. (ii) in the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities: (a) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock that potentially may be deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock at any time during the term thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subparagraph (i) above), if any, received by the company upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the common stock covered thereby; (b) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock that potentially may be deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof at 12 any time during the term thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities, options, or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration received by the company for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in paragraph (i) above); (c) on any increase in the number of shares or decrease in the effective exercise or conversion price of common stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options, rights or securities or conversions of or exchanges of such securities, including any change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof, the exercise price shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price as would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights or securities not converted prior to such change or options or rights related to such securities not converted prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change; (d) upon the expiration of any options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock that shall not have been exercised because such options or rights never fully vested or became fully exercisable, the exercise price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if the only additional shares of common stock issued were the shares of common stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the company for the issue of the options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock that were exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the company upon such exercise; and (e) no further adjustment of the exercise price adjusted upon the issuance of any such options, rights, convertible securities or exchangeable securities shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of common stock on the exercise of 13 any such rights or options or any conversion or exchange of any such securities. 4.4 upon stock dividends, subdivisions or splits. if, at any time after the original issue date, the number of shares of common stock outstanding is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of common stock or by a subdivision or split-up of shares of common stock, then, following the record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive such stock dividend, or to be affected by such subdivision or split-up, the exercise price shall be appropriately decreased by multiplying the exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such increase and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such increase in outstanding shares. 4.5 upon combinations or reverse stock splits. if, at any time after the original issue date, the number of shares of common stock outstanding is decreased by a combination or reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, then, following the record date to determine shares affected by such combination or reverse stock split, the exercise price shall be appropriately increased by multiplying the exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such decrease and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such decrease in outstanding shares. 4.6 upon reclassifications, reorganizations, consolidations, mergers or dispositions of assets. in the event of any capital reorganization of the company, any reclassification of the stock of the company (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving person or where there is a change in or distribution with respect to the common stock) or sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the company's property, assets or business to another corporation, each warrant shall after such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or disposition of assets be exercisable for the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company or of the successor person resulting from such consolidation or surviving such merger, if any, to which the holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable (immediately prior to the time of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger) upon exercise of such warrant would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or disposition of assets. the provisions of this clause shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers or dispositions of assets. the company shall not effect any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or disposition of assets unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor person (if other than the company) resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or disposition of assets, shall assume, by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to the holders of the warrant such shares of stock, securities or assets, which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holders shall be entitled to 14 receive upon such conversion. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.6 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers or dispositions of assets. 4.7 deferral in certain circumstances. in any case in which the provisions of this section 4 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date of an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event (a) issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the shares of capital stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event and issuing to such holder only the shares of capital stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustments, and (b) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share of capital stock pursuant to section 2.3 above; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to such holder an appropriate instrument or due bills evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares or such cash. 4.8 reserved. 4.9 voluntary reduction. the company from time to time may reduce the exercise price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period; provided, however, that in no event may the exercise price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the exercise price is reduced, the company shall mail to all holders a notice of the reduction. the company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced exercise price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced exercise price and the period it will be in effect. 4.10 appraisal procedure. in any case in which the provisions of this section 4 shall necessitate that the appraisal procedure be utilized for purposes of determining an adjustment to the exercise price, the company may defer until the completion of the appraisal procedure and the determination of the adjustment (1) issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after the date of the event that requires the adjustment and before completion of the appraisal procedure and the determination of the adjustment, the shares of capital stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event and issuing to such holder only the shares of capital stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (2) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share of capital stock pursuant to section 2.3 above; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to such holder an appropriate instrument or due bills evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares or such cash. 4.11 adjustment of number of shares purchasable. upon any adjustment of the exercise price as provided in section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, the holders of the warrants shall thereafter be entitled to purchase upon the exercise thereof, at the exercise price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of warrant stock (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) obtained by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of warrant stock issuable on the exercise hereof immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. 15 4.12 increase of number of shares purchasable. after giving effect to all other provisions in this article 4, the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased when the exercise price is adjusted to an amount below the then existing par value of the warrant shares, including successive adjustments to the exercise price to an amount further below the then existing par value. the number of additional shares purchasable upon exercise of this warrant shall be equal to number obtained by dividing the result of subsection (i) by the result of subsection (ii): (i) the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of the warrants before application of this section 4.12 times the difference between the then existing par value per warrant share minus the adjusted exercise price. (ii) the difference between the fair market value of the company's common stock on the exercise date minus the then existing par value per warrant share. 4.13 form of warrants. irrespective of any adjustments of the number of shares purchasable or of the exercise price, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the warrants initially issuable pursuant to this agreement. 4.14 changes in securities. notwithstanding any provision in this section 4 to the contrary and without limitation to any other provision contained in this section 4, in the event any securities of the company are amended, modified or otherwise altered by operation of its terms or otherwise in any manner whatsoever (including through the anti-dilution provisions thereof) that results in (i) the reduction of the effective exercise, conversion or exchange price of such securities payable upon the exercise for, or conversion or exchange into, common stock or other securities exercisable for, or convertible or exchangeable into, common stock and/or (ii) such securities becoming exercisable for, or convertible or exchange into (a) more shares or dollar amount of such securities which are, in turn exercisable for, or convertible or exchangeable into, common stock, or (b) more shares of common stock, then such amendment, modification or other alteration shall be treated for purposes of section 4 as if the securities which have been amended, modified or altered had never been issued and new securities have been issued with the amended or modified terms. the company shall make all necessary adjustments (including successive adjustments if required) to the exercise price in accordance with section 4, but in no event shall the exercise price be greater than it was immediately prior to the application of this section 4.14 to the amendment, modification or alteration in question. 4.15 maximum exercise price. except as provided in section 4.5 above, at no time shall the exercise price per share of common stock exceed the amount set forth in the first paragraph of the preamble of this warrant. 4.16 exceptions.

the act) that may be adopted after the original issue date by the board of directors of the company and approved by the stockholders of the company, (iv) the issuance of up to 100,940 shares of common stock upon conversion of the company's class b preferred stock, up to 310,472 shares of common stock upon conversion or exchange of the company's class c preferred stock, including any additional shares of common stock thereunder to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions of the series c preferred stock; (v) the issuance of up to 1,900,000 shares of common stock upon the conversion or exchange of the class b units issued or issuable pursuant to the overseas operating agreement, (vi) the issuance and exercise of up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the overseas warrants, (vii) the issuance and exercise of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to warrants issued in connection with the other financing transactions occurring within three days of the original issue date pursuant to the economic terms of such warrants as they exist on such date, (viii) the issuance of equity securities to the seller or sellers in connection with an acquisition of a business or substantially all of the assets of a business so long as none of the sellers is, immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, an affiliate of the company, (ix) securities issued in a public offering registered under the securities act so long as the issuance is for gross cash consideration that (a) exceeds the dilution price and (b) represents no greater than a 5% discount to the fair market value on the effective date of the registration statement with respect to such offering, (x) securities issued pursuant to a financing after the original issue date in which silver point (or its affiliates) provide more than 75% of the funding, and (xi) the issuance and exercise of warrant stock pursuant to the warrants. the numbers of shares set forth in this section 4.16 are subject to adjustment for the matters contemplated by sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.5 herein. 4.17 notice of adjustment of exercise price. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable or the exercise price is adjusted as herein provided: (i) the company shall compute the adjusted exercise price in accordance with this section 4 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the treasurer or chief financial officer of the company setting forth the adjusted exercise price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall forthwith be filed at the designated office; and (ii) a notice stating that the exercise price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted exercise price shall forthwith be prepared by the company, and as soon as practicable after it is prepared, such notice shall be mailed by the company at its expense to all holders at their last addresses as they shall appear in the warrant register. 4.18 independent application. except as otherwise provided herein, all subsections of this section 4 are intended to operate independently of one another (but without duplication). if an event occurs that requires the application of more than one subsection, all applicable subsections shall be given independent effect without duplication. 17 5. no impairment; regulatory compliance and cooperation; affiliate transactions; notice of expiration 5.1 no impairment. the company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its charter documents or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other similar voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holder against impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of warrant stock upon the exercise of this warrant, free and clear of all liens, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under this warrant. the company shall not take any action, enter into any transaction or suffer to exist any event, action or state of facts that would cause the exercise price to be adjusted below the then existing par value of common stock (unless the common stock is changed to capital stock with no par value); provided, however, that nothing herein will prevent the operation of any other provision of this warrant, including the anti-dilution provisions of section 4. 5.2 no dilution. if any event shall occur as to which the provisions of section 4 are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment would adversely affect the purchase rights represented by the warrant in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such section (including, without limitation, the issuance of securities other than common stock which have the right to participate in distributions to the holders of common stock, the granting of "phantom stock" rights or "stock appreciation rights"), then, in each such case, the company shall, upon the request of any holder, appoint an investment banking firm of recognized national standing, or any other financial expert that does not (or whose directors, officers, employees, affiliates or stockholders do not) have a direct or material indirect financial interest in the company or any of its subsidiaries, who has not been, and, at the time it is called upon to give independent financial advice to the company, is not (and none of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates or stockholders are) a promoter, director or officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in section 4, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the purchase rights, represented by this warrant. prior to such determination by such investment banking firm, the company and the requesting holder(s), respectively, shall specify the amount, if any, of the adjustment that such party has determined in good faith to be appropriate. the adjustment determined by the investment banking firm shall be within the range of the adjustments thus proposed by the parties, and the costs and fees of such investment banking firm shall be allocated proportionately between the company, on one hand, and the holder(s), on the other, based on the respective differences between the amount of the adjustment as determined by such investment banking firm and the amounts of such adjustment proposed by the company and the holder(s). upon receipt of such opinion, the company will promptly mail a copy thereof to the holders of the warrants and shall make the adjustments described therein. 18 5.3 other agreements. the company is not a party to or bound in any manner under, and covenants that it will not enter into at any time after the date hereof, any agreement or contract (whether written or oral) with respect to any of its securities which prevents the company from complying in any respect with the rights granted by the company hereunder. 5.4 affiliate transactions. so long as the holder is entitled to purchase any shares of common stock, without the prior written consent or vote of the majority holder, the company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its securities, properties or assets to, or purchase any securities, property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any affiliate of the company (each, an "affiliate transaction"), unless: (i) the affiliate transaction is on terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the company or the relevant subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the company or such subsidiary with a person that is not an affiliate, and (ii) the company delivers to the holder, with respect to any affiliate transaction or series of related affiliate transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $100,000, an officers' certificate certifying that such affiliate transaction complies with clause (i) above. notwithstanding the foregoing, section 5.4 should only apply to the extent that the company does not have its common stock listed on the nasdaq stock market or the new york stock exchange. 6. reservation and authorization of common stock 6.1 reservation. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the exercise of the warrants such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as will be required for issuance of the warrant stock. all shares of warrant stock issuable pursuant to the terms hereof, when issued upon exercise of this warrant with payment therefor in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, not subject to preemptive rights and shall be free and clear of all liens. before taking any action that would result in an adjustment in the number of shares of warrant stock for which this warrant is exercisable or in the exercise price, the company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction over such action. if any shares of warrant stock required to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of warrants require registration or qualification with any governmental entity under any federal or state law (other than under the securities act or any state securities law) before such shares may be so issued, the company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible and at its expense endeavor to cause such shares to be duly registered. 6.2 corporate action. before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the exercise price below the then par value (if any) of the shares of warrant stock deliverable upon exercise of the warrant or that would cause the number of shares of warrant stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant to exceed (when taken together with all other outstanding shares of common stock) the number of shares of common stock that the company is authorized to issue, the company will take any corporate action that, in the opinion of its counsel, is necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue the full 19 number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of warrant stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant at such adjusted exercise price. 7. notice of corporate actions; taking of record; transfer books 7.1 notices of corporate actions. in case: (a) the company shall grant to the holders of its common stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class; or (b) the company shall declare to the holders of its common stock any dividend or distribution; or (c) of any reclassification of the common stock (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of common stock), or of any consolidation, merger or share exchange to which the company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of
