having the voting rights of such shares of common stock, constituting approximately 23.5% of the shares outstanding. the percentage used herein is calculated based upon the 2,725,020 shares of common

$1,444,445 (the "notes") payable to elk international corporation limited (the "reporting person"). the notes were delivered as partial consideration for the purchase of certain shares of common stock of the issuer from the reporting person, and are secured pursuant to a security and pledge agreement executed on september 29, 1993, as amended (the "security agreements"), and by the personal guarantee of park, individually. the notes were due and payable in full on december 31, 1995. the security agreements secure 240,000 shares of common stock (including 40,000 shares of common stock previously issued to park as a dividend on its outstanding shares), 156,876 shares of common stock subsequently acquired by park, 250,000 shares of the issuer's preferred stock and an additional 450,000 shares of preferred stock in the possession of park. in the event of a default, park agreed to allow elk to vote all of the park shares. this represents an aggregate of 396,876 shares of common stock and 700,000 shares of preferred stock which votes as a class with the common stock, for a total of 1,096,876 votes. the notes were not paid on the maturity date and on january 12, 1996, park executed a new promissory note in the amount of $2,700,000, replacing the two prior notes. the new note was due and payable as follows; $100,000 due 1/29/96, $100,000 due 3/30/96, $100,000 due 6/30/96, $150,000 due 9/30/96, and $2,250,000 due 12/15/96. park defaulted on payment of the new note as agreed. a notice of default was given to park and the default was not cured. under the terms of the security agreement, upon default, the reporting person has the immediate right to vote all shares subject 4 to such agreement, in addition to rights of foreclosure with respect to all of such shares. it is the position of the reporting person that the security agreement, securing the note, covers the 396,876 shares of common stock and 700,000 shares of preferred stock (pledged after the initial default), representing 14.6% of the issuer's outstanding common stock and 30% of the voting control of the issuer's securities. on september 29, 1993, hardee capital partners, l.p. ("hardee") executed and delivered two secured non-interest bearing promissory notes in the principal amount of $805,555 and $1,444,445 (the "notes") payable to the reporting person. the notes were delivered as partial consideration for the purchase of certain shares of common stock of the issuer from the reporting person, and are secured pursuant to a security and pledge agreements executed on september 29, 1993 (the "security agreements"), and by the personal guarantee of david w. hardee, individually. the notes were due and payable in full on december 31, 1995. the security agreements provided for the pledge of all shares of the issuer's common stock owned by hardee or mr. hardee as of the date of the security agreement or acquired thereafter. as of the date hereof, such security interest related to a total of 779,444 shares of common stock of the issuer owned by hardee and 105,860 shares of the issuer owned by mr. hardee. on november 8, 1994, the $1,444,455 note and the 641,944 shares representing collateral were assigned to microtel international inc. ("mol"), and 137,500 shares remained as collateral for the reporting person's note. on december 31, 1995, the $805,555 note was not paid as due, and hardee thereafter was notified that the note was in default. on february 5, 1996, hardee paid the reporting person the sum of $125,000, leaving a new balance of $680,555 due and payable in full on august 20, 1996 to the reporting person. hardee agreed to pay an extension fee in the amount of $44,000 to the reporting person (payable in monthly installments of $5,500 each, on the 30th of each month). hardee defaulted on payment of the note as agreed. a notice of default was given to hardee and the default was not cured. under the terms of the security agreement, upon default, the reporting person has the immediate right to vote all shares subject to such agreement, in addition to rights of foreclosure with respect to all such shares. it is the position of the reporting person that the security agreement, securing the note, covers the 137,500 shares owned by hardee and an additional 105,860 shares owned by hardee individually. as a result of the 396,876 shares of common stock and 700,000 shares of preferred stock owned by park and the 243,360 shares of common stock owned by hardee and mr. hardee, all of which the reporting person has the right to vote, the reporting person has the right to vote an aggregate of 640,236 shares of the issuer's common stock, representing 23.5% of the issuer's outstanding shares of common stock. together with the 5 700,000 shares of preferred stock. the reporting person has the right to vote 1,340,236 shares, representing 37% of the combined voting power of the common stock and the preferred stock. the reporting person is the beneficial owner of approximately 33% of the common stock of mol. in december 1995, mol agreed to extend the maturity of the $1,444,455 note to december 15, 1996 in consideration for the payment by hardee of $358,300. hardee did not pay $8,300 of such amount as agreed, therefore, hardee defaulted on the obligation to mol. a notice of default was given to hardee and the default was not cured. under the terms of the security agreement, upon default, mol has the immediate right to vote all shares subject to such agreement, in addition to its rights of foreclosure with respect to all of such shares. it is the position of mol that the security agreement, securing the $1,444,445 note, covers 641,944 shares representing 23.6% of the issuer's outstanding common stock and that mol has the sole right to vote such shares. as of the date hereof, mol has not commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to such shares of common stock. as a result of the default on the notes assigned from the reporting person to mol in november 1994, mol has the right to vote an aggregate of 641,944 shares of the issuer's common stock. although the reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of such 641,944 shares of the issuer's common stock (representing 23.6% of the issuer's outstanding common stock), assuming all of such shares were voted together, they would represent an aggregate of 1,982,180 shares, or 54.7% of the voting control of the issuer. it is the reporting person's position that the above described defaults by park and hardee could result in a change of control of the issuer. there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with the reporting person or any other person with respect to the securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any other securities, finders' fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties of profits, divisions of profits or loss or the giving or withholding of proxies, except as disclosed herein. item 7. materials to be filed as exhibits. 10.1. letter agreement dated september 29, 1993 between hee poong park and hardee capital partners ("purchasers") and elk international corporation ltd.
