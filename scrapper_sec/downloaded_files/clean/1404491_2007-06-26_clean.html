manner that disproportionately materially adversely affects an investor without such investor's consent. 4.2 severability. in the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable law, be

applicable law. the provisions hereof are severable, and in the event any provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any respect, it shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any other provision hereof. 4.3 remedies. the parties hereto agree that, except as provided herein, this agreement shall be enforceable by all available remedies at law or in equity (including specific performance). if parent determines to enforce the provisions of the equity commitment letters in accordance with this agreement, and hidary is prepared to cause parent to consummate the merger in accordance with section 2.2 of this agreement and to fund the commitments upon consummation of the merger, as evidenced in writing to the other investors (the investors who are so prepared, the "closing investors"), but one or more investors fails to fund its commitment or provides written notice that it will not fund its commitment (each such investor, a "defaulting investor"), the parties agree that parent, acting at the direction of the closing investors (which, pursuant to section 2.1, must include hidary), shall be entitled, at its discretion, to either (a) specific performance of the terms of this agreement, whether before or after the closing, together with any costs of enforcement incurred by the closing investors in seeking to enforce such remedy, (b) payment by the defaulting investors in an amount equal to the out-of-pocket damages incurred by such closing investors (including amounts paid under any such investor's guarantee) in an amount not to exceed such defaulting investor's commitment, or (c) such other remedies as may be available to parent at law or in equity. if the closing investors determine to cause parent to enforce the remedy described in the preceding sentence against any defaulting investor, they must do so against all defaulting investors and, prior to doing so, the closing investors must affirm their willingness to fund their commitments. if parent, acting at the direction of the investors entitled to enforce this agreement in respect of any provision hereof, elects to do so against another investor, it must do so against any other investor that has similarly failed to perform with respect to the same provision hereof. if there are multiple defaulting investors, each defaulting investor's portion of the total obligations hereunder shall be the amount equal to the product of (a) the amounts due from all defaulting investors hereunder multiplied by (b) a fraction of which the numerator is the amount of such defaulting investor's commitment and the denominator is the sum of all defaulting investors' commitments. in no event shall any investor be liable under this agreement in an amount that exceeds the amount of such investor's commitment less the amounts previously funded by such investor pursuant to the equity commitment letters and guarantees, regardless of the form of action (including breach of warranty, breach of contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or statutory) or type of damages. if any investor for any reason pays damages to the company and/or parent in an amount greater than the amount of its commitment, to the extent that parent receives any such amount, parent shall promptly return to such investor the amount received from such investor in excess of its commitment. 4.4 no recourse. notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this agreement, and notwithstanding the fact that certain of the investors may be partnerships or limited liability companies, parent and each investor covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no recourse under this agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this agreement shall be had against any former, current or future directors, officers, agents, affiliates, general or limited partners, members, managers or stockholders of any investor or any former, current or future directors, officers, agents, affiliates, employees, general or limited 5 partners, members, managers or stockholders of any of the foregoing, as such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any current or future director, officer, employee, general or limited partner or member or manager of any investor or of any partner, member, manager or affiliate thereof, as such, for any obligation of any investor under this agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. 4.5 governing law; consent to jurisdiction. this agreement, and any disputes hereunder, shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without regard to principles of conflict of laws thereof. in addition, each party (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the united states of america located in the city and state of new york solely for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding between any of the parties hereto arising out of this agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (c) waives any claim of improper venue or any claim that the courts of the city and state of new york are an inconvenient forum for any action, suit or proceeding between any of the parties hereto arising out of this agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, (d) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this agreement in any court other than the courts of the city and state of new york and (e) to the fullest extent permitted by law, consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in section 10.02 of the merger agreement. 4.6 waiver of jury trial. each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any proceeding, controversy or claim which may arise under this letter agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby. 4.7 exercise of rights and remedies. no delay of or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default by any other party under this agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of any similar breach or default occurring later, nor shall any such delay, omission or waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default occurring before or after that waiver. 4.8

modified from time to time, the "merger agreement"), by and among hidary group acquisitions, llc, a delaware limited liability company ("parent"), hidary group acquisitions, inc., a delaware corporation ("merger sub") and the guaranteed party, pursuant to which merger sub will merge with and into the guaranteed party, the guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the guaranteed party, the due and punctual performance and discharge of its pro rata share (as defined below) of the payment obligations of parent and merger sub under section 9.03(f) of the merger agreement (the "obligations"); provided that in no event shall the guarantor's liability under this guarantee exceed its pro rata share of the parent termination fee (the "cap"), it being

any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the merger agreement or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the obligations; (c) the addition, substitution or release of any person interested in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including any other guarantor); (d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of parent, merger sub or any other person interested in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including
