(b) upon any adjustment of the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant as herein provided, the warrant purchase price per warrant share shall be adjusted by multiplying the warrant purchase price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the number of warrant shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. - 6 - 4.2 issuance of equity rights; distribution of assets or securities.

(b) if at any time the company makes a distribution (a &#147; distribution &#148;) to its stockholders of any asset, including cash, or any security (the total of the assets or securities so distributed, the &#147; distribution amount &#148;), then, at the holder&#146;s option: (1) the holder shall have the right to receive an amount of assets, including cash, or such security equal to the number of warrant shares for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the distribution, multiplied by the distribution amount, and divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at such time. upon the closing of the distribution, the company shall distribute such portion of the distribution amount to the holder; or (2) the warrant purchase price shall be adjusted and shall be equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, multiplied by a fraction (which shall not be less than zero), the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock on the date fixed for such determination, less the then-fair market value of the portion of the assets, or the fair market value of the portion of the securities, as the case may be, so distributed applicable to one share of common stock, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock. such adjustment to the warrant purchase price shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day immediately following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. upon any adjustment to the warrant purchase price as provided for in this section 4.2(b)(2) , the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall also be adjusted and shall be equal to the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. 4.3 issuance of equity securities under certain circumstances. (a) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell (or, in accordance with section 4.3(b) , shall be deemed to have issued or sold) any shares of common stock (other than the excluded shares) for a consideration per share that is less than the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such common stock, then, effective immediately upon such issuance or sale, the warrant - 7 - purchase price in effect immediately after such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted to a price equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to the sum of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company upon such issuance would purchase at a price equal to the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance per share, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of such common stock. upon each such adjustment of the warrant purchase price hereunder, the number of warrant shares which may be obtained upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number of shares determined by multiplying (i) the number of warrant shares which could be obtained upon exercise of such warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the warrant purchase price in effect immediately after such adjustment. adjustments shall be made successively whenever such an issuance or sale is made. (b) for the purpose of determining the adjusted warrant purchase price under section 4.3(a) , the following shall be applicable: (1) if the company in any manner issues or grants any equity rights or convertible securities and the price per share for which shares of common stock are issuable upon the exercise of such equity rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or grant of such equity rights, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such equity rights (or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such equity rights) shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of equity rights or upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities issuable upon exercise of equity rights shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing or granting of such equity rights, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such equity rights, plus in the case of such equity rights which relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such equity rights or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such equity rights. (2) if the company in any manner issues or grants any convertible securities having an exercise or conversion or exchange price per share which is less than the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to - 8 - such issuance or sale, then the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such lower price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the price per share for which shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion or exchange of convertible securities is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received by the company as consideration for the issuance or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. (3) if the purchase price provided for in any equity rights, the additional consideration, any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock decreases at any time, then the warrant purchase price in effect at the time of such decrease shall be readjusted to the warrant purchase price which would have been in effect at such time had such equity rights or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such decreased purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted, by taking the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the warrant purchase price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the warrant purchase price as so adjusted. (4) if any shares of common stock or equity rights are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, then the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the gross amount received by the company therefor. if any shares of common stock or equity rights are issued or sold for consideration other than cash, then the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder&#146;s rights under section 4.7(e) . (5) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time does not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company or any subsidiary, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or sale of shares of common stock. (6) if the company takes a record of the holders of shares of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock or equity rights or (b) to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or equity rights, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the - 9 - declaration of such dividend or the making of such distribution or the date of the granting or such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (c) if, at any time after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell its common stock or equity rights pursuant to a stock option or other employee incentive or benefit plan or arrangement, or any additional shares of common stock become issuable or are issued upon conversion of equity rights outstanding on the date hereof as a result of an adjustment resulting from the issuance of this warrant or the accrual, payment-in-kind or other dividend distribution under such equity rights, including, without limitation, under the company&#146;s 7-1/2% senior cumulative preferred stock (the &#147; senior preferred &#148;) and the company&#146;s series b 7% cumulative convertible preferred shares (the &#147; series b preferred &#148;), this warrant shall immediately become exercisable for such additional warrant shares as are necessary to maintain the percentage ownership interest in the company calculated on a fully diluted basis held by holder immediately prior to such adjustment, issuance or accrual, payment-in-kind or potential issuance of additional shares of common stock as a result of such adjustment, issuance or accrual, payment-in-kind or other dividend distribution with respect to such equity rights, including with respect to the senior preferred and the series b preferred. upon any such adjustment of the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant, the warrant purchase price per share shall be adjusted by multiplying the warrant purchase price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the number of warrant shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. (d) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 4.3 with respect to the issuance of excluded shares. 4.4 reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. (a) if at any time prior to the expiration date, the company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital stock, consolidates, merges or combines with or into another person (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is any change whatsoever in, or distribution with respect to, the outstanding shares of common stock), or the company sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its property, assets or business to another person, other than in a transaction provided for in sections 4.1 , 4.2 , 4.3 , 4.5 or 4.6 , and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, (i) equity securities of the successor or acquiring person or of the company (if it is the surviving corporation) or (ii) any cash, equity securities or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring person or the company (&#147; other property &#148;) are to be received by or distributed to the holders of shares of common stock who are holders immediately prior to such transaction, then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock, common stock of the successor or acquiring person, and/or other property which a holder of the number of warrant shares for which this warrant is exercisable - 10 - immediately prior to such event would have owned or received immediately after and as a result of such event. in such event, the aggregate warrant purchase price otherwise payable for the warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be allocated among such securities and other property in proportion to the respective fair market values of such securities and other property as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, subject to the holder&#146;s rights under section 4.7(e) . (b) in case of any such event, the successor or acquiring person (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as the holder may approve in writing (and memorialized by resolutions of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of any equity securities of such successor or acquiring person for which this warrant thus becomes exercisable, which modifications shall be as equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4.4 . for purposes of this section 4 , &#147;common stock of the successor or acquiring person&#148;

present or future amendment hereof, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, regardless of which party initiates such action, suit or other proceeding; and each party hereby agrees and consents that any such action, suit or other proceeding shall be decided by a court trial without a jury, and that any party may file an original counterpart or a copy of this section with any court as written evidence of the consent of the parties to the waiver of any right they might otherwise have to trial by jury. 5.18 judicial referee . in the event the waiver provided in section 5.17 is

adjudication, any and all issues of fact or law involved in any litigation or proceeding (including, without limitation, all discovery and law and motion matters, pretrial motions, trial matters and

sounding in contract, tort, under any statute or otherwise) between and among any of the parties hereto, to a judicial referee who shall be appointed under a general reference pursuant to california code of civil procedure section 638. the referee&#146;s decision would stand as the decision of the court, with judgment to be entered on his/her statement of decision in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court. the parties hereto shall select a single neutral referee, who shall be a retired state or federal judge with at least five years of judicial experience in civil matters. in the event that the parties hereto cannot agree upon a referee, the referee shall be appointed by the court. the purchaser and holders, on the one hand, and the company parties, on the other hand, shall equally bear the fees and expenses of the referee (50% by the purchaser and holders and 50% by the company parties) unless the referee otherwise provides in the statement of decision. - 19 - in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed and issued by its duly authorized representatives on the date first above written. butler international, inc. ,

parent has agreed to grant to purchaser the rights set forth in this agreement. agreement now, therefore , in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: 1. co-sale agreement. 1.1 subject to section 5.2(a) hereof, if one or more principal shareholders propose to sell or transfer any shares of common stock now owned or held by it or them (&#147; co-sale shares &#148;) in any transaction (or series of related transactions) that does not constitute a public sale, then such principal shareholder or principal shareholders shall promptly notify the parent and purchaser in writing (the &#147; co-sale notice &#148;) at least twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such proposed sale or transfer. the co-sale notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed sale or transfer, including, without limitation, the number of co-sale shares to be sold or transferred, the nature of such sale or transfer, the consideration to be paid and the name and address of each prospective purchaser or transferee. for purposes of this agreement, the term &#147; public sale &#148; shall mean a sale, transfer or other disposition of common stock pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act or in a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act, subject to in all cases to the limitation in section 5.2(a) hereof. it is acknowledged and understood that each principal shareholder may pledge his shares or transfer or &#147;gift&#148; his shares for estate planning purposes, provided that such shares continue to be subject to the provisions of this section 1 . it is further acknowledged and understood that any shares of common stock (i) delivered to the parent by the principal shareholders in order to have the parent pay any tax obligation of the principal shareholders upon the exercise of any option granted under any employee stock option plan of the parent or in lieu of a cash payment for the exercise price of any option granted under any employee stock option plan of the parent or (ii) sold or transferred by the principal shareholders as payment for any obligation under the knott settlement shall not be deemed to be co-sale shares. 1.2 purchaser shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice to the principal shareholders within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the co-sale notice, to participate in such sale on the same terms and conditions as specified in the co-sale notice, subject to reduction of the proceeds receivable by the purchaser of the warrant purchase price with respect to warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant. to the extent that purchaser exercises such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this section 1 , the number of co-sale shares that the principal shareholders may sell in the transaction(s) shall be correspondingly reduced. 1.3 if there shall be a decrease in the price to be paid by the proposed purchaser for the co-sale shares to be purchased from the price set forth in the co-sale notice, which decrease is acceptable to the principal shareholders, or any other material change in the terms or conditions set forth in the co-sale notice which are less favorable to the principal shareholders but which are acceptable to the principal shareholders, the principal shareholders shall immediately notify purchaser in writing of such decrease or other change, and purchaser shall have five (5) business days from the date of receipt of such written notice to modify the number of shares of common stock it will sell to the purchaser, as previously indicated in the written notice delivered by purchaser pursuant to section 1.2 . 1.4 purchaser may sell all or any portion of that number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of common stock covered by the co-sale notice, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock or warrant shares, as applicable, owned by purchaser at the time of the sale or transfer (collectively, the &#147; purchaser shares &#148;), and the denominator of which is the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock owned by the principal shareholders and purchaser at the time of the sale or transfer. in no event shall purchaser be required to make any representation or warranty in connection with the sale to any prospective purchase other than as to the organization and authority of purchaser, title to the shares of common stock to be sold by purchaser and the absence of conflict with laws or material agreements of purchaser. 1.5 purchaser shall effect its participation in the sale by promptly delivering to the principal shareholders for transfer to the prospective purchaser one or more certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent: 2 (a) the type and number of shares of common stock which purchaser elects to sell; or (b) delivery of the warrant with respect to the number of warrant shares which is at such time exercisable or convertible into the number of shares of common stock which purchaser elects to sell; provided , however , that if the prospective purchaser objects to the delivery of the warrant and warrant shares in lieu of common stock, purchaser shall convert or exercise the warrant into shares of common stock and deliver common stock as provided in section 4.4(a) . the parent agrees to make any such conversion or permit such exercise concurrent with the actual transfer of such shares to the purchaser. 1.6 the stock certificate or certificates that purchaser delivers to the principal shareholders pursuant to section 1.4 shall be transferred to the prospective purchaser in consummation of the sale of the common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the co-sale notice, and the principal shareholders shall concurrently therewith remit to purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available funds that portion of the sale proceeds to which purchaser is entitled by reason of purchaser&#146;s participation in such sale. to the extent that any prospective purchaser prohibits such assignment or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from purchaser, the principal shareholders shall not sell to such prospective purchaser any shares of common stock unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the principal shareholders shall purchase such shares or other securities from purchaser. subject to the foregoing sentence, if the principal shareholders do not complete the proposed sale or transfer for any reason, the principal shareholders shall immediately return to purchaser all documents (including, without limitation, the warrant and all stock certificates, stock assignments and/or powers of attorney) which purchaser delivered to the principal shareholders pursuant to this section 1 or otherwise in connection with such sale or other transfer. 1.7 the exercise or non-exercise of the rights of purchaser hereunder to participate in one or more sales of co-sale shares by the principal shareholders shall not adversely affect its rights to participate in subsequent sales of co-sale shares by the principal shareholders. 1.8 prohibited transfers. (a) in the event of any sale or purported sale (including, without limitation, the entering into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding to sell) of co-sale shares by any principal shareholder in contravention of the co-sale rights of purchaser hereunder (a &#147; prohibited transfer &#148;), purchaser shall have, in addition to all other rights, powers or remedies available at law, in equity, under this agreement or any other investment document or under applicable law, the right to exercise the prohibited transfer put (as such term is defined below), and such principal shareholder agrees that he shall be bound by the applicable provisions hereof. (b) in the event of a prohibited transfer by a principal shareholder: 3 (1) the parent shall, upon the request of purchaser, instruct the parent&#146;s transfer agent not to enter such prohibited transfer on the stock ledger or other similar records of the parent;

and the parent shall promptly, but in no event more than five (5) business days after request for payment, pay directly or reimburse each indemnitee for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided , however , that the parent will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or omission made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the parent, in writing, by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein. the parent shall not refuse to enter into an underwriting agreement with any underwriter of the registrable securities on the basis that the indemnity provisions therein are unacceptable as long as the terms of such indemnity provisions are, on the whole, reasonably typical for the type of underwriting contemplated. 4.2. indemnification by holders of registrable securities . each selling holder of registrable securities will, in the event that any registrable securities held by such selling holder are included in any registration being effected under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (severally and not jointly) the parent, each of its directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents and each underwriter (if any), and each other person, if any, who controls the parent or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to the registration statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the parent by such selling holder and stated to be specifically for use therein, and shall, within five (5) business days after a request therefor, reimburse the parent, its directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of 12 registrable securities be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities. 4.3. conduct of indemnification proceedings . promptly after receipt by any person of any written notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the &#147;

provided , however , that the failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to such indemnified party hereunder, except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure. if the indemnified party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other indemnifying parties, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided , however , that in any action in which both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party are named as defendants, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the indemnified party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the indemnified party against the indemnifying party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such indemnifying party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. 4.4. contribution . if the indemnification provided for in the foregoing sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified parties and the indemnifying parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of any indemnified party and any indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged 13 untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnified party or such indemnifying party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any holder of registrable securities be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder after taxes from the sale of registrable securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5. underwriting and distribution . 5.1. rule 144 . the parent covenants that it shall file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and shall take such further action as the holders of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. purchaser hereby acknowledges its understanding that the parent is not current with its filings under the exchange act. 5.2. restrictions on sale by the parent and others . the parent agrees that (a) it will not effect any sale or distribution of any securities similar to those being registered in accordance with section 2.1, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the ninety (90) days prior to, and during the one hundred eighty (180) day period commencing on, the effective date of any demand registration (except as part of such demand registration to the extent permitted by section 2.1(d)); and (b) any agreement entered into after the date hereof pursuant to which the parent issues or agrees to issue any privately placed securities shall contain a provision under which holders of such securities agree not to effect any sale or distribution of any such securities during the periods described in (a) above, in each case including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of any such registration, if permitted);

possible. 6.5. counterparts . this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts and by facsimile transmission or other similar means of electronic transmission, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. this agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral and written, and all contemporaneous oral, agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof. 6.6. descriptive headings, construction and interpretation . the rules of construction and interpretation set forth in sections 1.2 through 1.5 of the securities purchase agreement shall likewise govern the construction and interpretation of this agreement. 6.7. waivers and amendments . neither this agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally or by course of dealing, except by a statement in

the transactions contemplated by or related to this agreement, or (b) any conduct, act or omission of the parties or their affiliates (or any of them) with respect to this agreement, including any

as written evidence of the consent of the parties to the waiver of any right they might otherwise have to trial by jury. 6.12. judicial referee . in the event the waiver provided in section 6.11 is deemed ineffective, to give effect to the parties desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge or retired judge apply the applicable law, the parties agree to refer, for a complete and final adjudication, any and all issues of fact or law involved in any litigation or proceeding (including, without limitation, all discovery and law and motion matters, pretrial motions, trial matters and post-trial motions (e.g. motions for reconsideration, new trial and to tax costs, attorney fees and prejudgment interest)) up to and including final judgment, brought to resolve any dispute (whether sounding in contract, tort, under any statute or otherwise) between and among any of the parties hereto, to a judicial referee who shall be appointed 18 under a general reference pursuant to california code of civil procedure section 638. the referee&#146;s decision would stand as the decision of the court, with judgment to be entered on his/her statement of decision in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court. the parties hereto shall select a single neutral referee, who shall be a retired state or federal judge with at least five years of judicial experience in civil matters. in the event that the parties hereto cannot agree upon a referee, the referee shall be appointed by the court. the purchaser and holders, on the one hand, and the company parties, on the other hand, shall equally bear the fees and expenses of the referee (50% by the purchaser and holders and 50% by the company parties) unless the referee otherwise provides in the statement of
