except as permitted by the stock purchase agreement or as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by p&f, against the following actions (other than the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement): (a) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving orion or any of its subsidiaries; (b) a sale, lease, license, transfer or disposition of any assets outside the ordinary course of business or any which in the aggregate are material to orion and its subsidiaries (other than landmark) taken as a whole, or a reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of the issuer or orion; (c) (1) any change in a majority of the persons who constitute the board of directors of the issuer; (2) any change in the present capitalization of orion or any of its subsidiaries or any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of orion or any of its subsidiaries; (3) any other material change in the corporate structure or business of orion or any of its subsidiaries; or (4) any other action which, in the case of each of the matters referred to in clauses c (1), (2), (3) or (4) is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, or materially adversely affect the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. each stockholder further agreed (i) to immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any parties with respect to any acquisition of all or any material portion of the assets of, or any equity interest in, orion or its subsidiaries (other than landmark) or any business combination with orion or its subsidiaries (other than landmark), in such stockholder's capacity as such, and (ii) from and after the date of the stockholders agreement until termination of the stock purchase agreement, unless and until the issuer is permitted to take such actions under section 5.08 of the stock purchase agreement, to not, in such capacity, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or assistance), or take any other action to facilitate knowingly, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any such transaction or acquisition, or agree to or endorse any such transaction or acquisition, or authorize or permit any of such 10 cusip no. 591695-10-1 page 10 of 18 stockholder's directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents to do so, and such stockholder shall promptly notify p&f of any proposal and shall provide a copy of any such written proposal and a summary of any oral proposal to p&f immediately after receipt thereof (and shall specify the material terms and conditions of such proposal and identify the person making such proposal) and thereafter keep p&f promptly advised of any development with respect thereto. in addition, each stockholder agreed not to, directly or indirectly, (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any or all of such stockholder's common stock or any interest therein; (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the subject matter of the stockholders agreement, deposit any shares of common stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any shares of common stock; or (iii) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of such stockholder contained in the stockholders agreement untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling such stockholder from performing his or its obligations under the stockholders agreement. the stockholders agreement terminates upon the later of (a) september 30, 1997, or (b) ninety days after the date of the meeting of the issuer's stockholders held for the purpose of approving and adopting the stock purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (provided that, if no such meeting is held prior to september 30, 1997, the covenants and agreements contained therein with respect to the common stock terminates on september 30, 1997). subsequent to the date of the stockholders agreement, the stockholders, as a group, acquired additional shares of common stock. under the terms of the stockholders agreement,

(c) buyer and seller shall cooperate with each other in contesting any tax claim, which cooperation shall include, without limitation, granting powers of attorney to the party who is entitled to control the proceedings, retaining and providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to such tax claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such tax claim. (d) any payment under this article ix shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment of the purchase price to the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under relevant tax authorities, including court decisions, statutes, regulations and administrative promulgations. (e) the indemnification obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to the taxes that are the subject of the indemnification obligation. article xii miscellaneous 12.01. notices. all notices, requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder shall be in writing. any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given (i) if personally delivered, when so delivered, (ii) if mailed, two business days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed to the intended recipient as set forth below, (iii) if given by telex or telecopier, once such notice or other communication is transmitted to the telex or telecopier number specified below and the appropriate answer back or telephonic confirmation is received, provided that such notice or other communication is promptly thereafter mailed in accordance with the provisions of clause (ii) above or (iv) if sent through an overnight delivery service in circumstances to which such service guarantees next day delivery, the day following being so sent: 60 72 if to seller or any entertainment company: metromedia international group, inc. c/o metromedia company 215 east 67th street new york, new york 10021 attention: president facsimile: 212-535-3541 with copies to: metromedia international group, inc. one metromedia plaza east rutherford, new jersey 07073 attention: general counsel facsimile: 201-531-2803 and paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton & garrison 1285 avenue of the americas new york, new york 10019 attention: james m. dubin, esq. facsimile: 212-757-3990 if to buyer: p&f acquisition corp. 2500 broadway street fifth floor santa monica, california 90404 attention: general counsel facsimile: 310-449-3011 with a copy to: gibson, dunn & crutcher llp 333 s. grand avenue los angeles, ca 90071 attention: bruce d. meyer, esq. facsimile: 213-229-7520 any party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication hereunder using any other means (including ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice, request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the individual for whom it is intended. any party may change 61 73 the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties notice in the manner herein set forth. 12.02. amendments; no waivers.

(a) in connection with any claim which may give rise to indemnity under this article ix resulting from or arising out of any claim or proceeding against an indemnitee by a person that is not a party hereto, the indemnifying party may (unless such indemnitee elects not to seek indemnity hereunder for such claim), upon written notice to the relevant indemnitee, assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding if all indemnifying parties with respect to such claim or proceeding jointly acknowledge to the indemnitee its right to indemnity pursuant hereto in respect of the entirety of such claim (as such claim may have been modified through written agreement of the parties) and provide assurances, reasonably satisfactory to such indemnitee, that the indemnifying parties will be financially able to satisfy such claim in full if such claim or proceeding is decided adversely. if the indemnifying parties assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnifying parties shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to such indemnitee to conduct the defense of such claim or proceeding, shall take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof and shall at all times reasonably diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. if the indemnifying parties shall have assumed the defense of any claim or proceeding in accordance with this section 9.05, the indemnifying parties shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or proceeding, with the consent of the indemnitee, which consent will be not unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that no such consent shall be required from such indemnitee if the indemnifying parties shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness thereof; provided, further, that the indemnifying parties shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of any indemnitee or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any indemnitee or to its conduct of business; and provided, further, that a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete release of such indemnitee and its affiliates, officers, employees and if named as a defendant, consultants and agents with respect to such claim. each indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such action at its own cost and expense. each indemnitee shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates, officers, employees, consultants and agents to, cooperate fully with the indemnifying parties in the defense of any claim or proceeding being defended by the indemnifying parties pursuant to this section 9.05. (b) if the indemnifying parties do not assume the defense of any claim or proceeding resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms of this section 9.05(a), such indemnitee may defend against such claim or proceeding in the manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such claim 51 59 or proceeding after giving notice of the same to the indemnifying parties, on such terms as such indemnitee may deem appropriate. if the indemnifying parties seek to question the manner in which such indemnitee defended such claim or proceeding or the amount of or nature of any such settlement, the indemnifying parties shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such indemnitee did not defend such claim or proceeding in a reasonably prudent manner. (c) although the indemnification rights provided in this article ix shall extend to the respective affiliates of buyer and seller, for the purpose of the procedures set forth in this section 9.05, any claims for indemnification shall be made by and through buyer or seller, as the case may be. 9.06. nature of payments. any payment under this article ix shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment of the purchase price to the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under relevant tax authorities, including court decisions, statutes, regulations and administrative promulgations. 9.07. taxes the provisions of this article ix shall not be applicable to taxes, which shall be governed by article xi. article x termination 10.01. grounds for termination. this agreement may be terminated at any time (except with respect to clauses (h), (i), (j) and (k) which contain certain time limitations) prior to the closing: (a) by mutual written agreement of all of the parties hereto;

(ii) buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all tax returns, other than consolidated returns, of the entertainment companies for any pre-closing period, that are required to be filed after the closing date. seller shall pay buyer, in immediately available funds, any taxes that are required to be paid with such tax returns, and shall be entitled to any refunds of taxes with respect to such tax returns.

(e) to the extent permitted by law, seller and buyer shall use their best efforts to cause any taxable period to close on the closing date. (f) taxes payable with respect to a straddle period shall be allocated to the pre-closing period and post-closing period on the basis of a closing of the books as of the closing date or any other method agreed upon by buyer and seller, except that taxes imposed on a periodic basis, such as real and personal property taxes, shall be prorated based on the number of days before and after the closing date.

(c) seller shall be responsible for the payment of any taxes of seller affiliated group or the entertainment companies that result from the section 338 elections (the "section 338 taxes"). 11.03. indemnification.

(b) with respect to any tax claim, tax indemnitor shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such tax claim (including, without limitation, selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the tax claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that tax indemnitor shall not settle or compromise a tax claim without giving thirty (30) days notice to tax indemnitee and without tax indemnitee's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, if such settlement or compromise would result in a material tax liability of tax indemnitee or members of its affiliated group for any taxable period. if tax indemnitee reasonably withholds its consent, the indemnification obligation of tax indemnitor to tax indemnitee under this article xi shall be limited to the amount of such settlement or compromise, and tax indemnitee shall have the right to take over the control of any proceedings with respect to such tax claim at its own expense. (c) buyer and seller shall cooperate with each other in contesting any tax claim, which cooperation shall include, without limitation, granting powers of attorney to the party who is entitled to control the proceedings, retaining and providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to such tax claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such tax claim. (d) any payment under this article xi shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment of the purchase price to the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under relevant tax authorities, including court decisions, statutes, regulations and administrative promulgations. (e) the indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this article xi shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to the taxes that are the subject of the indemnification obligation. article xii miscellaneous 12.01. notices. all notices, requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder shall be in writing. any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given (i) if personally delivered, when so delivered, (ii) if mailed, two (2) business days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed to the intended recipient as set forth below, (iii) if given by telex or telecopier, once such notice or other communication is transmitted to the telex or telecopier number specified below and the appropriate answer back or telephonic 60 68 confirmation is received, provided that such notice or other communication is promptly thereafter mailed in accordance with the provisions of clause (ii) above or (iv) if sent through an overnight delivery service in circumstances to which such service guarantees next day delivery, the day following being so sent: if to seller or any entertainment company: metromedia international group, inc. c/o metromedia company 215 east 67th street new york, new york 10021 attention: president facsimile: 212-535-3541 with copies to: metromedia international group, inc. one metromedia plaza east rutherford, new jersey 07073 attention: general counsel facsimile: 201-531-2803 and paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton & garrison 1285 avenue of the americas new york, new york 10019 attention: james m. dubin, esq. facsimile: 212-757-3990 if to buyer: p&f acquisition corp. 2500 broadway street fifth floor santa monica, california 90404 attention: general counsel facsimile: 310-449-3011 with a copy to: gibson, dunn & crutcher llp 333 s. grand avenue los angeles, california 90071 attention: bruce d. meyer, esq. facsimile: 213-229-7520 61 69 any party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication hereunder using any other means (including ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice, request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the individual for whom it is intended. any party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties notice in the manner herein set forth. 12.02. amendments; no waivers.
