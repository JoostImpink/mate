(b) prior to the mailing of the proxy statement/prospectus, newco shall appoint an independent bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the "paying agent"), which paying agent shall be reasonably satisfactory to the ------------ company, for the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration. 2.2 retained share elections. ------------------------ (a) each person who is a record holder of shares on or prior to 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on the date of the special meeting or the date of any meeting of stockholders held pursuant to any adjournment of the special meeting (the "election date") will be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of ------------- his or its shares, to make an election to retain shares as set forth in, and subject to the provisions of this section 2.2. (b) the company shall prepare and mail a form of election, which form shall be subject to the approval of investor (the "election form"), with the ------------- proxy statement/prospectus to the record holders of shares as of the record date for the special meeting, which election form shall be used by each record holder of shares who wishes to elect to retain shares in lieu of such shares being converted into the right to receive the cash merger price (as defined below) for each such share. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, any such election shall be subject to proration as set forth below. the company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the election form and the proxy statement/prospectus available to all persons who become holders of shares during the period between such record date and the election date. any such holder's election to retain shares shall have been validly made only if the paying agent shall have received at its designated office, on or prior to the election date, an election form properly completed and signed in accordance with such rules as the paying agent may establish pursuant to section 2.2(e), and accompanied by either (i) certificates for the shares to which such election form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the company or (ii) an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates as set forth in such election form from a firm which is a member of a registered national securities exchange or of the national association of securities dealers, inc., or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the united states (a "notice of --------- guaranteed delivery"). notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained - ------------------- herein, any election form accompanied by a notice of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not validly made if the certificate or certificates are in fact delivered to the paying agent after three (3) nasdaq stock market trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery. -4- (c) any election form may be revoked by the stockholder submitting such election form if a written notice of revocation is received by the paying agent prior to 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on the election date. in addition, all election forms shall be revoked automatically if this agreement is terminated pursuant to section 8.1. if an election form is revoked, the certificate or certificates (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate) for the shares to which such election form relates shall be returned by the paying agent to the stockholder submitting the same to the paying agent. (d) for purposes of this agreement, (i) "elected retained share" shall ---------------------- mean a share in respect of which an election to retain such share is validly made and not validly revoked prior to the election date and (ii) "elected cash ------------ share" shall mean a share in respect of which either an election to retain such - ----- share is not validly made prior to the election date or an election to retain such share is validly revoked prior to the election date. (e) the paying agent may, with the mutual agreement of the investor and the company, make such rules as are consistent with this section 2.2 for the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable fully to effect such elections. (f) the paying agent shall determine (i) whether or not elections to retain shares have been validly made or validly revoked pursuant to this section 2.2 and (ii) when elections and revocations have been received by it. if the paying agent determines that any election to retain shares was not validly made, such shares shall be converted in the merger into the right to receive the cash merger price (as defined below). the paying agent shall also make all computations as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by section 2.4. all determinations and calculations by the paying agent shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of shares. 2.3 conversion of shares. -------------------- (a) all shares held in the treasury of the company (the "excluded -------- shares") shall be canceled and shall cease to exist as of the effective time, - ------ without any consideration being payable therefore. (b) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, shares which would otherwise constitute elected cash shares or non-elected cash shares hereunder, which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and which are held by stockholders who did not vote in favor of the merger and who comply with all of the relevant provisions of section 262 of the dgcl (the "dissenting shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the ----------------- right to receive the cash merger price (as defined below), but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the surviving corporation with respect to such dissenting shares in accordance with the dgcl, unless and until -5- such holders shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the dgcl. if any such holder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's shares shall be converted into the right to receive the cash merger price (as defined below). the company shall give prompt notice to the investor of any demands received by the company for appraisal of shares, and the investor shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. the company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the investor, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. (c) by virtue of the merger, each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares, shall be retained or converted into the right to receive cash as follows: (i) each share that is an elected retained share and each share that is a non-elected retained share (as defined in section 2.4(c)) (in either case, a "retained share") shall be retained by the holder -------------- thereof following the effective time, shall remain outstanding and shall represent one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the surviving corporation; and (ii) each share that is an elected cash share and each share that is a non-elected cash share (as defined in section 2.4(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation $11.00 in cash (the "cash merger price"). ----------------- 2.4 proration. --------- (a) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the aggregate number of retained shares (the "actual retained share number") shall ---------------------------- be equal to 727,273 shares. (b) if the aggregate number of shares constituting elected retained shares (the "elected retained share number") exceeds the actual retained share ----------------------------- number, then the number of shares which shall be retained shares pursuant to section 2.3(c)(i) shall be reduced by such excess number of shares (each such share included among such excess, a "non-elected cash share"). in such event, ---------------------- each holder of elected retained shares shall be allocated non-elected cash shares in lieu of retained shares such that (after giving effect to section 2.6(e)) each such holder shall be deemed to hold non-elected cash shares in an amount equal to (x) the total number of elected retained shares held by such holder less (y) the product of (a) a fraction, the numerator of which is the ---- actual retained share number, and the denominator of which is the elected retained share number, multiplied by (b) the total number of elected retained shares held by such holder. -6- (c) if the actual retained share number is greater than the elected retained share number, then the aggregate number of shares which shall be converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be decreased by a number of shares equal to the excess of the actual retained share number over the elected retained share number (each share included among such excess, a "non-elected retained share"). in such event, each holder of elected -------------------------- cash shares (other than the investor) shall be allocated a portion of the non- elected retained shares in lieu of elected cash shares (after giving effect to section 2.6(e)) equal to (i) the number of elected cash shares held by such holder, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of non-elected retained shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of elected cash shares held by all holders (other than the investor). 2.5 conversion of common stock of newco. ----------------------------------- (a) the shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share ("newco ----- share"), of newco, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective - ----- time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become at the effective time 3,363,636 shares of common stock of the surviving corporation. (b) if the investor shall purchase shares prior to the effective time pursuant to the stockholder agreement, a number of such shares, to be determined in investor's discretion, may be contributed by the investor to newco immediately prior to the effective time and shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the effective time without any consideration being payable therefor. any other shares purchased by the investor shall be retained by the investor and shall be entitled to receive the cash merger price (but shall not be treated as retained shares). 2.6 exchange of certificates. ------------------------ (a) as soon as reasonably practicable as of or after the effective time of the merger, newco shall deposit with the paying agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares, for payment in accordance with this article ii, the funds necessary to pay the cash merger price for each share. (b) as soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which prior thereto represented shares, upon surrender to the paying agent of such certificate or certificates and acceptance thereof by the paying agent, shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing the number of full retained shares of the surviving corporation, if any, to be retained by the holder thereof as retained shares pursuant to this agreement and the amount of cash, if any, into which the number of shares previously represented by such certificate or certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this agreement. the paying -7- agent shall accept such certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the paying agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. after the effective time of the merger, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the company or its transfer agent of certificates representing shares which have been converted, in whole or in part, pursuant to this agreement, into the right to receive cash, and if such certificates are presented to the company for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of such cash. if any certificate for retained shares is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to, a name other than that in which the certificate for shares surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the company or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such retained shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the company or its transfer agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.6(b), each certificate for shares shall be deemed at any time after the effective time of the merger to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the cash merger price for each share (other than any retained share) and a new certificate for each retained share, as contemplated by section 2.1. (c) no dividends or other distributions with respect to retained shares with a record date after the effective time of the merger shall be paid to the holder of any certificate for shares not surrendered with respect to the retained shares represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to section 2.6(e) until the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this article ii. subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole retained shares issued in connection therewith, without interest (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional retained share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 2.6(e) and the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the merger therefor paid with respect to such retained shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the merger but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole retained shares. (d) all cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates representing shares in accordance with the terms of this article ii (including any cash paid pursuant to section 2.6(e)) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such certificates. -8- (e) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, each holder of shares retained pursuant to the merger who would otherwise have been entitled to retain a fraction of a retained share (after taking into account all shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment (without interest) equal to such fraction multiplied by the cash merger price. (f) any cash deposited with the paying agent pursuant to this section 2.6 (the "exchange fund") which remains undistributed to the holders of the ------------- certificates representing shares 180 days after the effective time of the merger shall be delivered to the surviving corporation at such time and any holders of shares prior to the merger who have not theretofore complied with this article ii shall thereafter look only to the surviving corporation and only as general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, if any. (g) none of newco or the company or the paying agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the exchange fund delivered to a public office pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. if any certificates representing shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the effective time of the merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity (as defined below)), any such cash in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

obligations under this agreement) and such breach or failure shall continue unremedied for ten (10) days after the investor or the newco has received written notice from the company of the occurrence of such breach or failure; provided, however, that in ----------------- remedying any such breach or failure neither investor nor newco shall have spent any money, incurred any liabilities or
