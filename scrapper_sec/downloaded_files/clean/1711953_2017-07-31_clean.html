25 the securities represented by this instrument have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state and may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of except while a registration statement relating thereto is in effect under such act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from registration under such act or such laws. &#160; the securities represented by this certificate are subject to transfer and other restrictions set forth in an investment agreement, dated as of april 20, 2017, copies of which are on file with the secretary of the issuer. &#160;

(1) give written notice to the purchaser representative (no less than twenty (20) business days prior to the closing of such issuance or if the company reasonably expects such issuance to be completed in less than twenty (20) business days, such shorter period, which shall be as long as commercially practicable (and in any event no less than ten (10) business days), required for the north island parties and their permitted transferees to participate in such issuance) setting forth in reasonable detail (a)&#160;the designation and all of the terms and provisions of the securities proposed to be issued (the " proposed securities "), including, where applicable, the voting powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualification, limitations or restrictions thereof and interest rate and maturity; (b)&#160;the price and other terms of the proposed sale of such securities; (c)&#160;the amount of such securities proposed to be issued; and (d)&#160;such other information as the purchaser representative may reasonably request in order to evaluate the proposed issuance; and &#160; (2) offer to issue and sell to the north island parties, on such terms as the proposed securities are issued and upon full payment by the north island parties, a portion of the proposed securities equal to a percentage determined by dividing (a)&#160;the number of shares of class a common stock the north island parties beneficially own by (b)&#160;the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding. &#160; (c) &#160; the north island parties must exercise their purchase rights hereunder within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of such notice from the company, or if the company reasonably expects such issuance to be completed in less than twenty (20) business days, such shorter period, which shall be as long as practicable (and in any event no less than ten (10) business days after receipt of notice from the company), required for the north island parties and, subject to section&#160;4.1, their permitted transferees to participate in such issuance.&#160; if the company offers two (2) or more securities in units to the other participants in the offering, the north island parties must purchase such units as a whole and will not be given the opportunity to purchase only one (1) of the securities making up such unit.&#160; the closing of the exercise of such subscription right shall take place simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the proposed securities giving rise to such subscription right. &#160; (d) &#160; upon the expiration of the offering period described above, the company will be free to sell such proposed securities that the north island parties have not elected to purchase during the ninety (90) days following such expiration on terms and conditions no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than those offered to the north island parties in the notice delivered in accordance with section&#160;4.3(b).&#160; any proposed securities offered or sold by the company after such 90-day period must be reoffered to the north island parties pursuant to this section&#160;4.3. &#160; 27 (e) &#160; the election by any north island parties not to exercise its subscription rights under this section&#160;4.3 in any one instance shall not affect their right as to any subsequent proposed issuance.&#160; any sale of such securities by the company without first giving the north island parties the rights described in this section&#160;4.3 shall be void and of no force and effect. &#160; (f) &#160; notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the purchase rights of the north island parties under section 4.3(b) shall be deemed satisfied if the company provides (or causes to provide) the north island parties the right to purchase from the company or any person within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the proposed securities, the same number of proposed securities that the north island parties would have had the right to purchase under section 4.3(b). &#160; 4.4 &#160; election of directors . &#160; (a) &#160; for so long as the north island parties beneficially own shares of class a common stock that represent at least 50% of the number of shares of class a common stock beneficially owned by the north island parties as of the closing, the north island parties shall have the right to designate for nomination two (2) members of the board of directors (the "north island designees").&#160;

provided, however, that in no event shall any north island designee's relationship with the north island parties or their affiliates (or any other actual or potential lack of independence resulting therefrom) be considered to disqualify any north island designee from being a member of the board of directors pursuant to this section&#160;4.4.&#160; so long as the north island designees are elected to the board of directors by the company's stockholders, the north island designees shall serve the term associated with the class of directors to which such director belongs in accordance with the certificate of incorporation.&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, at such time as the threshold set forth in this section 4.4(a) is no longer satisfied, one of the north island designees, as specified by the purchasers (or, if the purchaser fails to do so within ten (10) days of such requirement not being satisfied, the board of directors), shall immediately resign, and the purchaser shall cause such north island designee immediately to resign, from the board of directors effective as of the first date on which the threshold set forth in this section 4.4(a) ceases to be satisfied and the right of the north island parties to designate for nomination a director under this section 4.4(a) shall terminate. &#160;

provided, however, that in no event shall such north island designee's relationship with the north island parties or their affiliates (or any other actual or potential lack of independence resulting therefrom) be considered to disqualify such north island designee from being a member of the board of directors pursuant to this section&#160;4.4.&#160; so long as such north island designee is elected to the board of directors by the company's stockholders, such north island designee shall serve the term associated with the class of directors to which such director belongs in accordance with the certificate of incorporation.&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, at such time as the threshold set forth in this section 4.4(b) is no longer satisfied, the north island designees shall immediately resign, and the purchaser shall cause the north island designees immediately to resign, from the board of directors effective as of the first date on which the threshold set forth in this section 4.4(b) ceases to be satisfied, and the purchaser shall no longer have any rights under this section 4.4, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any designation and/or nomination rights under section 4.4(a) or 4.4(b). &#160;

(d) &#160; for so long as the north island parties have the right to designate a director for nomination pursuant to section&#160;4.4(a) or 4.4(b) above, (1) the company or the board of directors shall (i)&#160;cause the board of directors to have sufficient vacancies to permit such persons to be added as members of the board of directors, (ii)&#160;nominate such persons for election to the board of directors, and (iii)&#160;recommend that the company's stockholders vote in favor of the persons designated for nomination by the north island parties in all subsequent stockholder meetings.&#160; nothing in this section&#160;4.4 shall modify the conditions set forth in section&#160;1.3(b)(7) and (8).&#160; in the event of the death, disability, resignation or removal of any person designated by the north island parties as a member of the board of directors, subject to the continuing satisfaction of the applicable threshold set forth in section&#160;4.4(a), as applicable, the north island parties may designate a person to replace such person and, provided that such designee is reasonably acceptable to the company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and subject to the north island designees' satisfaction of all applicable requirements set forth in sections 4.4(a) or 4.4(b), as applicable, the company shall cause such newly designated person to fill such resulting vacancy.&#160; so long as any person designated by the north island parties to serve as a member of the board of directors is eligible to be so designated in accordance with this section&#160;4.4, the company shall not take any action to remove such person as such a director without cause without the prior written consent of the north island parties.&#160; subject to compliance with applicable laws, regulations or stock exchange rules, the board of directors shall consider in good faith any request by a north island designee to serve on any committee or committees of the board of directors upon which such north island designee may wish to serve;

promptly after any company related party, purchaser affiliated party or purchaser related party (hereinafter, the " indemnified party ") has received notice of any indemnifiable claim hereunder, or the commencement of any action, suit, claim, arbitration, compliant, enforcement proceeding, investigation or other proceeding by any governmental entity or other third person, which the indemnified party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim under this agreement (each, a " third party claim "), the indemnified party shall give the indemnitor hereunder (the " indemnifying party ") written notice of such third party claim but failure or delay to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have to such indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.&#160; such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such third party claim to the extent then known.&#160; the indemnifying party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of, and settle, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter as long as the indemnifying party pursues the same diligently and in good faith.&#160;
