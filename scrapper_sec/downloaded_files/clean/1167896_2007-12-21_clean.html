purchaser &#148;), in connection with those certain stockholder agreements, each dated as of december 11, 2007, by and among teradyne and purchaser, on the other hand, and each of juan a. benitez, howard d. marshall, james p. moniz, eugene r. white, tim moriarty, stephen newberry, richard dissly, craig foster and robin adler (each, individually, a &#147;stockholder&#148; and collectively, the &#147;stockholders&#148;), respectively, on the other hand. the stockholder agreements were entered into in connection with the signing of the agreement and plan of merger (the &#147; merger agreement &#148;), dated as of december 11, 2007, by and among teradyne, purchaser and nextest systems corporation, a delaware corporation (the &#147; issuer&#148;) . the merger agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, teradyne&#146;s acquisition of the issuer via (i) a cash tender offer pursuant to which the purchaser will offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&#147; common stock &#148;) of the issuer (the &#147; offer &#148;) followed by (ii) the merger of purchaser with and into the issuer with the issuer as the surviving corporation (the &#147; merger &#148;). item 1. security and issuer. this statement relates to shares of common stock. the principal executive office of the issuer is located at 875 embedded way, san jose, california 95138. item 2. identity and background. this statement is being filed by teradyne and purchaser. the address of the principal business and the principal offices of each of teradyne and purchaser is 600 riverpark drive, north reading, massachusetts 01864. teradyne is a leading supplier of automatic test equipment. purchaser exists for the purpose of effecting the offer and the merger. the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and citizenship of each director and executive officer of teradyne and/or purchaser are set forth on schedule a hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. during the last five years, neither teradyne nor purchaser, nor, to the knowledge of teradyne and purchaser, any of the persons listed on schedule a has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the stockholders&#146; agreements have been entered into to secure the support of the issuer&#146;s directors and named executive officers for the offer and merger pursuant to the merger agreement. teradyne and purchaser acquired shared voting power with respect to the shares of common stock owned by the stockholders via execution of the stockholder agreements. as of the date of this statement, neither teradyne nor purchaser have paid any funds or other consideration relating to the &#147;beneficial ownership&#148; of common stock reported herein. teradyne estimates that the total amount of funds and other consideration required to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to the offer and to complete the merger and to pay related fees and expenses will be approximately $325 million. this figure is net of the cash acquired and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and transaction costs. teradyne&#146;s existing cash on hand will provide the necessary funds to complete the offer and the merger. schedule b hereto sets forth, to the knowledge of teradyne and purchaser, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned (for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) by each stockholder. item 4. purpose of transaction. on december 11, 2007, teradyne, purchaser and the issuer, entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, teradyne will acquire the issuer via the offer and the subsequent merger. upon consummation of the offer, the issuer will become a majority owned subsidiary of purchaser, and a majority owned indirect subsidiary of teradyne. upon consummation of the merger, the issuer will become a wholly- owned subsidiary of teradyne. the primary intent of teradyne and purchaser is to complete the offer and the merger so that teradyne acquires control of the issuer. page 4 of 11 schedule 13d in the offer, purchaser is offering to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock at a purchase price of $20.00 per share, net to sellers in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholdings of taxes (the &#147; offer price &#148;). the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer a number of shares of common stock that represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis (the &#147; minimum condition &#148;). the minimum condition may not be waived without the issuer&#146;s written consent. the merger agreement provides that, promptly after purchaser first accepts for payment any shares of common stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer, and from time to time thereafter, purchaser is entitled to elect or designate such number of members of issuer&#146;s board of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is equal to the product of: &#149; the total number of directors on the issuer&#146;s board of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by purchaser) multiplied by &#149; the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by teradyne, purchaser and any of purchaser&#146;s affiliates bears to the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the issuer has granted purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase, at a per share price equal to the offer price, that number of shares of common stock that is equal to one share of common stock more than the number of shares of common stock needed to give purchaser ownership of 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. this &#147;top-up option&#148; is exercisable only if, among other things, the minimum condition is satisfied. under the delaware general corporation law (the &#147; dgcl &#148;) if, as a result of the offer or otherwise purchaser acquires at least 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock, teradyne and purchaser could effect the merger without prior notice to, or any action by, any other stockholder of the issuer. upon consummation of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than (1) any shares of common stock owned by teradyne, purchaser or the issuer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of teradyne, purchaser or the issuer, or (2) any shares of common stock that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of section 262 of the delaware general corporation law) will be converted into the right to receive the offer price. upon consummation of the merger, each stock option outstanding under the issuer&#146;s equity incentive plans, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will automatically convert into the right to acquire shares of teradyne common stock, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such issuer stock option (including vesting schedule) except that &#149; the number of shares of teradyne common stock subject to each such option or right shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of nextest stock subject to such option immediately prior to the merger by a fraction (the &#147; equity award exchange ratio &#148;), the numerator of which is the offer price and the denominator of which is the average closing price of teradyne common stock on the new york stock exchange over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the merger occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share); and &#149; the exercise price per share of teradyne common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of nextest common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such option immediately prior to the merger divided by (y) the equity award exchange ratio. upon consummation of the merger, each outstanding share of nextest restricted stock will automatically convert into the right to receive the offer price upon the expiration of the applicable vesting or other lapse restrictions, and will remain subject to the same forfeiture or repurchase conditions in effect on the date of the merger agreement, except any such repurchase rights will be assigned to teradyne. upon consummation of the merger, each outstanding nextest restricted stock unit will automatically convert into a teradyne restricted stock unit. each such restricted stock unit will continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions, except that it will be for that number of whole shares of teradyne common stock equal to the product of the page 5 of 11 schedule 13d number of shares of nextest common stock that were subject to the restricted stock unit immediately prior to the merger multiplied by the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). upon consummation of the merger, the (i) directors of purchaser will be appointed as the directors of the issuer and (ii) certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the issuer will be restated in forms attached to the merger agreement. following the merger, the shares of common stock will no longer be traded on the nasdaq global market, there will be no public market for such shares, and registration of such shares under the exchange act will be terminated. as an inducement to enter into the merger agreement, and in consideration thereof, each stockholder, solely in such stockholder&#146;s capacity as stockholder of the issuer, entered into a stockholder agreement with teradyne and purchaser. pursuant to the stockholder agreements, each stockholder has agreed to tender and, subject to satisfaction of the minimum condition, sell to the purchaser all of such stockholder&#146;s shares of common stock pursuant to the offer not later than the third business day prior to the initial expiration date of the offer, and not to withdraw such shares once tendered. each stockholder has also agreed to vote his or her shares of common stock (a) in favor of the merger agreement and the merger and (b) against any alternative proposal. in addition, under the stockholder agreements (so long as they remain in effect), each stockholder has granted an irrevocable proxy to and appointed teradyne or any nominee of teradyne as such stockholder&#146;s proxy and attorney-in-fact to vote all of the shares held by each such stockholder (a) in favor of the merger agreement and the merger and (b) against any alternative proposal. on october 23, 2007, teradyne executed a confidentiality agreement with the issuer (the &#147; confidentiality agreement &#148;). the confidentiality agreement contains customary provisions pursuant to which, among other things, each party agreed on behalf of itself and its representatives, subject to certain exceptions, to keep confidential all non-public information furnished by the disclosing party and to use such information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the parties. the confidentiality agreement also includes customary mutual employee non-solicitation provisions operative for one year from the date of the confidentiality agreement. the confidentiality agreement further includes customary standstill provisions, operative for a maximum of one year from the date of the confidentiality agreement, prohibiting each of nextest and teradyne from, among other things, acquiring any voting securities issued by the other, without the prior written consent of the other party or the party&#146;s board of directors. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement, the stockholder agreements and the confidentiality agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. a copy of the merger agreement is attached as exhibit 1 to this statement, a copy of the form of stockholder agreement is attached as exhibit 2 to this statement. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b) other than those shares of common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned in connection with the stockholder agreements, teradyne has not acquired and, for the purposes of rule 13d-4 promulgated under the exchange act, does not beneficially own (with the sole right to vote and dispose of) any shares of common stock. as a result of the stockholder agreements, teradyne may be deemed to have the power to vote up to 5,212,115 shares of common stock in favor of approval of the merger agreement, and thus, for the purpose of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act, teradyne may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of an aggregate of 5,212,115 shares of common stock, constituting approximately 29.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of december 11, 2007, as represented by the issuer in the merger agreement. teradyne (i) is not entitled to any rights as a stockholder of issuer as to the common stock covered by the stockholder agreements, except as otherwise expressly provided in the stockholder agreements, and (ii) disclaims any beneficial ownership of such shares. except as set forth in this item 5(a) and (b), none of teradyne nor, to its knowledge, any person named on schedule a hereto, beneficially owns any shares of common stock. (c) except for the agreements described above, to teradyne&#146; knowledge, no transaction in the class of securities reported has been effected during the past 60 days by any person named in schedule a or item 5(a) and (b). page 6 of 11 schedule 13d (d) to teradyne&#146; knowledge, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities of issuer reported herein. (e) inapplicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of issuer. except for the agreements described above, to the knowledge of teradyne, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise), including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the shares of common stock, finder&#146;s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, between the persons named in item 2 hereof and any other person, with respect to any securities of issuer, including any securities pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or investment power over such shares, other than standard default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1: agreement and plan of merger by and among teradyne, inc., nac equipment corporation and nextest systems corporation, dated december 11, 2007 (incorporated in this capital schedule 13-d by reference to the current report on form 8-k filed by teradyne on december 13, 2007). exhibit 2: form of stockholder agreement between teradyne inc. and each of the stockholders party thereto, dated december 11, 2007 (incorporated in this capital schedule 13-d by reference to the current report on form 8-k filed by teradyne on december 13, 2007).
