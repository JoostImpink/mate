(ii) no adjustment of conversion price. no adjustment in the series a conversion price shall be made in respect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock unless the consideration per share for an additional share of common stock issued or deemed to be issued by the corporation is less than the series a conversion price in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to such issue. (iii) deemed issue of additional shares of common stock. in the event the corporation at any time or from time to time after the initial issue date shall issue any options or convertible securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall 9 have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that additional shares of common stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to paragraph 5(e)(v) of this section 4.2) of such additional shares of common stock would be less than the series a conversion price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be. in any such case in which additional shares of common stock are deemed to be issued: (a) no further adjustments in the series a conversion price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of convertible securities or shares of common stock upon the exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities; (b) if such options or convertible securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the corporation, or change in the number of common stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the series a conversion price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such change becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such change insofar as it affects such options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of the series a conversion price shall affect common stock previously issued upon conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock); (c) upon the expiration of any such options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such convertible securities that shall not have been exercised, the series a conversion price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if (1) in the case of convertible securities or options, the only additional shares of common stock issued were the shares of common stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the corporation for the issue of all such options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such convertible securities that actually were converted or exchanged, plus the additional 10 consideration, if any, actually received by the corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and (2) in the case of options for convertible securities, only the convertible securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such options and the consideration received by the corporation for the additional shares of common stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the corporation for the issue of all such options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the corporation (determined pursuant to paragraph 5(e)(v) of this section 4.2) upon the issue of the convertible securities with respect to which such options were actually exercised; (d) no readjustment pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) above shall have the effect of increasing the series a conversion price to an amount that exceeds the lower of (1) such series a conversion price on the original adjustment date, or (2) such series a conversion price that would have resulted from any issuance of additional shares of common stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date; (e) in the case of any options that expire by their terms not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the series a conversion price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (c) above; and (f) if any such record date shall have been fixed and such options or convertible securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the series a conversion price that became effective on such record date shall be cancelled as of the close of business on such record date, and shall instead be made on the actual date of issuance, if any. (iv) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of additional shares of common stock. in the event the corporation shall issue additional shares of common stock (including additional shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 5(e)(iii) of this section 4.2) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the series a conversion price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such series a conversion price shall be reduced concurrently with such issue to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by the following formula: 11 n + c cp' = cp * n + as where: cp' = the conversion price as so adjusted; cp = the former conversion price; n = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (or deemed issuance) assuming exercise or conversion of all outstanding securities exercisable for or convertible into common stock; c = the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received or deemed to be received by the corporation for the total number of additional securities so issued or deemed to be issued would purchase if the purchase price per share were equal to the then existing conversion price; as = the number of shares of common stock so issued or deemed to be issued. notwithstanding the foregoing, the series a conversion price shall not be so reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be an amount less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and deduction with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent reduction that, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or more. (v) determination of consideration. for purposes of this paragraph 5(e) of this section 4.2, the consideration received by the corporation for the issue of any additional shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) cash and property. such consideration shall (1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the corporation 12 (before commissions or expenses) excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends, (2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors, and (3) in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration that covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors; and (b) options and convertible securities. the consideration per share received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to paragraph 5(e)(iii) of this section 4.2 relating to options and convertible securities shall be determined by dividing (1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for the issue of such options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities by (2) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (f) other distributions. in the event the corporation shall at any time or from time to time make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, other than additional shares of common stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of series a 13 convertible preferred stock shall receive, upon the conversion thereof, the securities of the corporation that they would have received had their stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such event. (g) no impairment. the corporation will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of series a convertible preferred stock against impairment. (h) certificates as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the series a conversion price pursuant to this paragraph 5 of this section 4.2, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of series a convertible preferred stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of series a convertible preferred stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the series a conversion price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of series a convertible preferred stock. (i) notices of record date. in the event of any taking by the corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, any security or right convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive additional shares of common stock, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the corporation shall mail to each holder of series a convertible preferred stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, security or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution, security or right. 14 (j) issue taxes. the corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of shares of series a convertible preferred stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder in connection with any such conversion. (k) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any necessary amendment to the corporation's articles of incorporation. before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the series a conversion price below the then par value of the shares of common stock, as applicable, issuable upon conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock or that would cause the effective purchase price for the series a convertible preferred stock to be less than the par value of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock, the corporation will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of such common stock at such adjusted series a conversion price or effective purchase price, as the case may be. (l) fractional shares. no fractional share shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of series a convertible preferred stock. all shares of common stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of series a convertible preferred stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. if, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of common stock, the corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder 15 otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the board of directors). (m) notices. any notice required by the provisions of this paragraph 5 of this section 4.2 to be given to the holders of shares of series a convertible preferred stock shall be deemed given upon confirmed transmission by facsimile or telecopy or five days after deposit in the united states mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at its address appearing on the books of the corporation. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a shareholder to whom notice is to be given has an address of record that is outside of the united states, then any notice to such shareholder hereunder shall be deemed given upon confirmed transmission by facsimile or telecopy or ten days after deposit in the united states mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such holder at its address appearing on the books of the corporation. (n) adjustments. in case of any reorganization or any reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation, any consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another entity or entities or the conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, each share of series a convertible preferred stock (other than shares of series a convertible preferred stock for which the holder thereof has elected to receive the series a preferential amount pursuant to paragraph 3 above) shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of such share of series a convertible preferred stock would have been entitled upon the record date of (or date of, if no record date is fixed) such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or conveyance; and, in any case, appropriate adjustment (as reasonably determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series a convertible preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as equivalent as is practicable, in relation to any shares of stock or the securities or property (including cash) thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the shares of such series a convertible preferred stock. 6. redemption. the corporation, at its sole option, may redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding shares of the series a convertible preferred stock (including those issued pursuant to pik dividends), upon 60 days' advance written notice to the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock at a price per share equal to the series a preferential amount, after any time when (a) the 45-day average price reflects a 25% premium over the initial series a conversion price (as adjusted for any combinations, consolidations, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications, stock dividends [other than pik dividends], stock splits and the like) and (b) a credible financial advisor either underwrites the redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock or opines that such redemption and/or voluntary conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock prior thereto pursuant to paragraph 5(a) of this section 4.2 and the sale of all the common stock issued upon such conversion in a commercially reasonable manner would not significantly impact the market price of the common stock. on or prior to the date of redemption, the corporation may deposit in trust with a bank or trust company, for the account of the holders of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock to be redeemed, an amount of funds sufficient for such redemption. if (i) the redemption notice has been duly given and (ii) funds necessary for such redemption have been (1) deposited in trust in accordance with the foregoing sentence or (2) paid to the holders by the corporation, then all shares of series a convertible preferred stock with respect to which such deposit or payment has been made shall forthwith, whether or not the redemption date shall have occurred or the certificates evidencing such shares shall have been surrendered for cancellation, be deemed no longer to be outstanding for any purpose, and all rights with respect to such shares shall thereupon cease and terminate, provided, however, that in the event the redemption funds were deposited with a bank or trust company, each holder of shares of series a convertible preferred stock to be redeemed shall be entitled (i) to convert, on or prior to the redemption date, such shares of series a convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of these articles of incorporation or (ii) to receive, from the funds so deposited in trust, the redemption funds (without interest) in respect of such series a convertible preferred stock. any interest in respect of funds deposited by the corporation with a bank or trust company shall be paid to the corporation. 7. protective provisions. except as otherwise required by law, so long as at least 316,456 shares of the series a convertible preferred stock remain outstanding (as adjusted for any combinations, consolidations, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications, stock distributions, stock splits, stock dividends [other than pik dividends] and the like), the corporation shall not, without the vote or written consent by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock: 17 (a) take any action that materially and adversely alters or changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the series a convertible preferred stock; (b) increase or decrease the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock of the corporation or the total number of such shares of preferred stock designated as series a convertible preferred stock; (c) enter into any transaction or series of transactions (i) resulting in a merger, consolidation or share exchange of the corporation with or into any other corporation or other business entity after which the stockholders of the corporation immediately prior to the transaction would own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving corporation or other business entity, or (ii) in which all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of (other than to a corporation or other business entity in which the stockholders of the corporation immediately prior to the transaction would own at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the purchasing corporation or other business entity after the sale); (d) authorize any dividend or other distribution to shareholders at a time when the corporation's retained earnings do not reflect an increase, from the initial issue date, of at least the series a preferential amount, excluding any increase attributable to acquisitions in which shares of the corporation's capital stock were issued; (e) create or authorize any class or series of equity securities having a preference over or being on a parity with the series a convertible preferred stock with respect to redemption, voting, dividends or liquidation preference; (f) except for the sale of, or the grant of options with respect to, up to 740,000 shares of the corporation's common stock to officers, directors or employees of or consultants to the corporation, authorize the issuance of the corporation's equity securities at a price per share of less than (i) the initial series a conversion price, determined, to the extent applicable, on an as fully converted into common stock basis (taking into consideration payments made upon sale of the security as well as any payments due upon its exercise or conversion, if applicable and any appropriate adjustments for any combinations, consolidations, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassifications, stock distributions, stock splits, stock dividends [other than pik dividends] and the like) or (ii) the fair market value of such equity securities as of the date of the sale or grant, as 18 determined in good faith by the board of directors (taking into consideration the terms of such sale or grant, the amount of securities involved in the transaction, the liquidity of the investment, and such other factors as the board of directors deems in good faith to be appropriate); or (g) in any manner, whether by amendment hereof or of its bylaws, merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, sales of assets, sale of stock, tender offer, dissolution or otherwise, take any action, or permit any action to be taken, solely or primarily for the purpose of increasing the value of any class of stock of the corporation if the effect of such action is to reduce the value or security of the preferred stock. 19 ex-3 4 exhibit 3 (logo of fairview capital llc appears here) fairview capital llc friday, may 10, 1996 bill: we are grateful for your willingness to assist us in finalizing the jotan transaction. i hope the following is a correct and acceptable representation of the terms for a bridge loan to f-jotan, l.l.c. (or, the "company"), the entity which will be making the investment in the preferred shares, and which is controlled by me as the only manager: 1. you will make a loan to f-jotan of up to $500,000 which will be considered a true bridge loan, carrying interest at a compounding 10% rate until repayment, and an option (for $100 purchase price) for the right to receive an amount equal to 5% of the cash and any other consideration proceeds above the return of the $2,000,000 principal. if the loan is less than the maximum, the 5% option above will be pro-rated accordingly (but not below 4%). 2. for a period of 30 days after the closing of the jotan transaction, which is scheduled to be may 15th (next wednesday), you, tom darden, bill moore and i will determine if it is desirable and appropriate to have the sbic replace your loan with a more permanent one, perhaps therewith taking a 10% profit participation (instead of the 5% you would have received for the shorter loan). during the initial period post closing, you may convert any portion of your interest to equity in the company at your option. 3. if the answer to #2 above is negative and less than 100% of the loan is converted to equity by you, then beginning on the 31st day from closing f-jotan will have 45 days to repay the balance of your loan, without additional penalty, on the terms outlined above in item #1. if the repayment is not made in that time, then f-jotan will have another 45 days to repay the loan, but the option participation shall be 10% rather than 5%. 4. if the repayment is still not made after the time allowed above, then you shall have additional rights in the company: for up to six months from the end of the 30 + 90 days described above, you may convert any or all of your loan to equity in the company. *you will be named as the only additional manager of the company and therefore have a 50% voice in the commitment of capital decisions of jotan, inc., (* you will also have this option from day one until you convert or are repaid.) through the letter agreement between the company and f-jotan. you will be named to the board of jotan, inc. if you so wish. - the option participation becomes 25%. 5. as additional consideration for your willingness to make the loan, and to the extent of the company's power to control it, the company will give you a right of first refusal to acquire and/or co-lead the financing of the acquisition previously discussed. (due to the size of this deal the company's ability to enforce terms on both, jotan and/or outside financing sources is probably limited to its veto powers. i expect, however, that we will have control of this transaction.) bill, i hope this captures your intent. if so, please let me know by signing below. we will construct a note reflecting these terms. if all is well, then i will need funds wednesday (tuesday wire). i am going to "pre-sell" the loan amount on the assumption that you will not wish to stay involved. i do not expect to have difficulty with this except for time. sincerely, (signature of james d. lumsden appears here) james d. lumsden manager, f-jotan, l.l.c. agreed and accepted as of the date above: (signature of william l. rogers appears here) william l.

(b) underwriting. if the registration of which the company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the company shall so advise the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 2.3(a)(i). in such event the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this section 2.3 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their registrable securities through such underwriting shall, together with the company and the other parties distributing their securities through such underwriting, enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the company. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2.3, if the underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the underwriter may limit the number of registrable securities to be included in the registration and underwriting, or may exclude registrable securities entirely from such registration and underwriting subject to the terms of this section 2.3. the company shall so advise all holders of the company's securities that would otherwise be registered and underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of such -6- securities, including registrable securities, that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated in the following manner: shares, other than registrable securities and other securities that have contractual rights with respect to registration similar to those provided for in this section 2.3, requested to be included in such registration by shareholders shall be excluded, and if a limitation on the number of shares is still required, the number of registrable securities and other securities that have contractual rights with respect to registration that may be included shall be allocated among the holders thereof in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the amounts of registrable securities and such other securities held by each such holder at the time of filing the registration statement. for purposes of any such underwriter cutback, all registrable securities and other securities held by any holder that is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation shall also include any registrable securities held by the partners, retired partners, members, shareholders or affiliated entities of such holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, retired partners, members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons, and such holder and other persons shall be deemed to be a single "selling holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "selling holder" shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such "selling holder," as defined in this sentence. no securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. nothing in this section 2.3(b) is intended to diminish the number of securities to be included by the company in the underwriting. if any holder disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter. the registrable securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from registration. (c) right to terminate registration. the company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this section 2.3 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any holder has elected to include securities in such registration. 2.4 expenses of registration. all expenses incurred in connection with all registrations effected pursuant to sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.9, including without limitation all registration, filing and qualification fees (including state securities law fees and expenses), printing expenses, escrow fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company (and, if it is reasonably determined that a separate special counsel for the participating holders is necessary, the reasonable fees and disbursements of one such counsel) and expenses of any special audits incidental to or required by such registration shall be borne by the company; provided, however, that the company shall -7- not be required to pay stock transfer taxes or underwriters' discounts or selling commissions relating to registrable securities. notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding under section 2.2 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to have been registered, in which event the holders of registrable securities to have been registered shall bear all such expenses pro rata on the basis of the registrable securities to have been registered. notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, if at the time of the withdrawal, the holders have learned of a materially adverse change in the condition, business or prospects of the company from that known to the holders at the time of their request, then the holders shall not be required to pay any of said expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to section 2.2. 2.5 obligations of the company. whenever required under this section 2 to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its diligent efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and keep such registration statement effective for the lesser of 120 days or until the holder or holders have completed the distribution relating thereto.

(f) notify each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the 1933 act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. (g) use its diligent efforts to list the registrable securities covered by such registration statement with any securities exchange on which the common stock is then listed.

(j) permit any holder which holder, in the sole and exclusive judgment, exercised in good faith, of such holder, might be deemed to be a controlling person of the company, to participate in good faith in the preparation of such registration statement and to require the insertion therein of material, furnished to the company in writing, that in the reasonable judgment of such holder and its counsel should be included. 2.6 indemnification. (a) the company will, and does hereby undertake to, indemnify and hold harmless each holder of registrable -9- securities, each of such holder's officers, directors, managers, partners, members and agents, and each person controlling such holder, with respect to any registration, qualification or compliance effected pursuant to this section 2, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter, of the registrable securities held by or issuable to such holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) to which they may become subject under the 1933 act, the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 act"), or other federal or state law arising out of or based on (i) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular or other similar document (including any related registration statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made, (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of any federal, state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, or (iii) any failure to register or qualify registrable securities in any state where the company or its agents have affirmatively undertaken or agreed in writing that the company (the undertaking of any underwriter chosen by the company being attributed to the company) will undertake such registration or qualification on behalf of the holders of such registrable securities (provided that in such instance the company shall not be so liable if it has undertaken its best efforts to so register or qualify such registrable securities) and will reimburse, as incurred, each such holder, each such underwriter and each such director, manager, officer, partner, member agent and controlling person, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission made in conformity with written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by such holder or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein. (b) each holder will, and if registrable securities held by or issuable to such holder are included in such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 2, does hereby undertake to indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors and officers, and each person controlling the company, each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, and each other holder, each of such other holder's officers, directors, managers, partners, members and agents and each person controlling such other holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities -10- (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on (i) any failure of such holder or its agents or representatives to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 act or any other applicable securities or blue sky law, or (ii) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were made, and will reimburse, as incurred, the company, each such underwriter, each such other holder, and each such director, officer, manager, partner, member and controlling person of the foregoing, for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) was made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the liability of each holder hereunder (unless such holder's liability hereunder is based upon such holder's willful misconduct as determined by the non-appealable final decision of a court) shall be limited to the proportion of any such claim, loss, damage or liability that is equal to the proportion that the public offering price of the shares sold by such holder under such registration statement bears to the total public offering price of all securities sold thereunder, but in any event not to exceed the net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of securities under such registration statement. it is understood and agreed that the indemnification obligations of each holder pursuant to any underwriting agreement entered into in connection with any registration statement shall be limited to the obligations contained in this subsection 2.6(b). (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.6 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide such indemnification (the "indemnifying party") of any claim as to which indemnification may be sought promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge thereof, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at the indemnifying party's expense if representation of such indemnified party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding; and provided further that the failure of any -11- indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or any such litigation. an indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, may, without the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff therein, to such indemnified party, of a release from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. (d) in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the 1933 act in any case in which either (i) any holder exercising rights under this agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section 2.6 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section 2.6 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the 1933 act may be required on the part of any such holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 2.6; then, and in each such case, the company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate claims, losses, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of the securities offered by such holder pursuant to the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such registration statement, and the company will be responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that, in any case, (a) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all securities offered by it pursuant to such registration statement, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions (unless such holder's liability hereunder is based upon such holder's willful misconduct as determined by the non-appealable final decision of a court); and (b) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
