corporation is pursuant to rule 13d-4 and shall not be construed as an acknowledgment or admission that it is, for purposes of section 13(d) or 13(g) of the act, the beneficial owner of any securities covered by this schedule 13d. item 1. security and issuer. the class of equity securities to which this schedule 13d relates is the common stock, no par value (the "common stock"), of pacific cma, inc., a colorado corporation (the "issuer"). the principal executive offices of the issuer are located at 7331 south meadow court, boulder, colorado 80301. item 2. identity and background. the business address of lam king ko, alfred ("mr. lam") is 7331 south meadow court, boulder, colorado 80301. mr. lam's principal occupation is president and chairman of the board of directors of the issuer. he is a citizen of australia. he has not been convicted, during the last five years, in a criminal proceeding nor has he been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. the principal address of buller services corporation ("buller"), organized in the british virgin islands, is akara building, 24 de castro street, wickhams cay i, p.o. box 3136, road town, tortola, british virgin islands. it was formed by mr. lam for the principal business of holding mr. lam's certain business interests. it has not been, during the last five years, a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. mr. lam acquired the shares of common stock of the issuer through transactions which are memorialized in two agreements: (a) stock purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement"); and (b) stock exchange agreement (the "exchange agreement"). the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement (collectively, the "change of control agreements") were each executed as of july 25, 2000, and, following the preparation and delivery of various documents prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by those agreements, were each effective as of august 28, 2000. the purchase agreement was executed by mr. lam and by dean f. sessions, grant w. peck, gary s. joiner, mark disalvo, john stearns, richard stearns, scott olson, and jay lutsky (collectively, the "selling stockholders"). pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, mr. lam purchased 9,000,000 shares of the issuer's common stock from the selling stockholders for a purchase price of $45,000, which was paid through the delivery by mr. lam of a promissory note (the "promissory note"), written in favor of the selling stockholders' designated agent. the initial principal amount of the promissory note, and the interest accrued thereon, is due and payable in full three business days after nasd regulation inc. grants its approval to one of its member firms for the publication of bid and asked quotations on the otc bulletin board for the issuer's common stock. the exchange agreement was executed by an authorized representative of the issuer's then-current management and by an authorized representative of buller. mr. lam is the sole beneficial owner of buller. immediately before the transactions contemplated under the change of control agreements, buller was the sole shareholder of agi logistics (hong kong) limited, a hong kong corporation ("agi"). pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement, the issuer acquired all 15,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of agi's common stock from buller and, in exchange, the issuer issued 8,000,000 shares of its common stock to buller. accordingly, buller became the legal owner of 8,000,000 shares of the common stock of the issuer, and mr. lam became the beneficial owner, directly and indirectly through buller, of 17,000,000 shares of the common stock of the issuer. item 4. purpose of transaction. mr. lam's acquisition of shares of the common stock of the issuer is part of a series of transactions (described in item 3, above) that enabled mr. lam to obtain control of the issuer and operate agi as a subsidiary of the issuer. in connection with the effectiveness of the transactions contemplated by the change of control agreements, each of the issuer's then-current directors and officers resigned their positions after having appointed the designees of mr. lam. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. mr. lam is the beneficial owner of 17,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer, which constituted 85% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the issuer as of august 28, 2000. mr. lam has the sole power to vote or to direct the vote and the sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of such shares, either directly or indirectly through his control of buller. buller is the legal owner of 8,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer. because it is controlled by mr. lam, buller has no power to vote or to direct the vote nor the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of such shares. the filing of this schedule 13d by buller is pursuant to rule 13d-4 and shall not be construed as an acknowledgment or admission that it is, for purposes of section 13(d) or 13(g) of the act, the beneficial owner of any securities covered by this schedule 13d. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. mr. lam is the sole shareholder of buller. as such, mr. lam effectively directs the exercise of buller's voting and dispositive powers with respect to the shares of the issuer's common stock legally held by buller. item 7. material to be filed as
