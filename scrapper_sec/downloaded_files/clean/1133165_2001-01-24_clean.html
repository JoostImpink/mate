bahamian corporation, a holding company that holds most of the assets formerly owned by deltec, including the shares of the issuer, and accordingly any securities held by dbc may be deemed, for purposes of section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the &#147;act&#148;), to be beneficially owned by the company. the address of the principal business and offices of the company and

which such employment is conducted, and (d)&#160;citizenship. except where otherwise indicated in appendix i or as indicated above, the principal business of each organization listed in appendix i is the provision of financial services. during the five years preceding the filing of this statement, neither the company nor dbc, nor, to the knowledge of the company, any of their respective executive officers or directors, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body

dated as of december 31, 1996, among the issuer, dbc and john g. yedinak, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 2 hereto. the stockholder agreement gives dbc the right to nominate one director of the

exceed 25 percent of a class of voting stock of argo bancorp; and disa seeks to acquire a number of shares that would make it one of the two largest holders of a class of voting stock of argo bancorp

intention to take any action for the purpose or effect of changing the control of argo bancorp or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect; e. the

rebuttable determination of control, disa agrees to offer this agreement as evidence that the acquisition of any additional shares or control factor as proposed would not constitute an acquisition of control under the regulations. ii. the office has determined, and hereby agrees, to act favorably on the rebuttal, and in consideration of such a determination and agreement by the office to act favorably on the rebuttal, disa, the other persons signing this agreement and any other existing, resulting or successor entities of disa agree with the office that: a. unless disa shall have filed a
