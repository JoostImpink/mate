(a)-(c) and (f). king is the entity filing this schedule 13d and its principal business address and principal office address is 501 fifth street, bristol, tennessee 37620. king is a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that manufactures, markets and sells primarily branded prescription pharmaceutical products. each executive officer and each director of king is a citizen of the united states. the name, business address and present principal occupation of each executive officer and director is set forth in annex a to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference. other than executive officers and directors, there are no persons or corporations controlling or ultimately in control of king. (d) and (e). king has not, during the last five years, (i) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation of such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the source and amount of funds from this transaction were provided and will be provided from king's working capital. item 4. purpose of transaction. king purchased the first note, in the principal amount of $20 million, from the issuer pursuant to a note purchase agreement between the issuer and king dated as of december 19, 2000 (the "note purchase agreement") in a private transaction for investment purposes. the maturity date of the first note is december 19, 2007. the first note is convertible at any time into the conversion shares. pursuant to the note purchase agreement, king has also agreed to purchase a second senior convertible note (the "second note" and collectively with the first note, the "convertible notes"). the second note will be in the principal amount of $5 million and, except as described in this schedule 13d, will have substantially the same terms as the first note. based on the conversion price currently in effect with respect to the first note, the second note will initially be convertible into 500,000 shares of the common stock. king will have the right to purchase the second note at any time upon 20 days notice to the issuer. king is required to purchase the second note when the united states food and drug administration (the "fda") has accepted for filing the issuer's new drug application for its topical transdermal estrogen replacement therapy, estrasorb(tm), all subject to the terms and conditions of the note purchase agreement. the issuer has advised king that it expects to file the new drug application for estrasorb(tm) sometime in -3- 4 in the first half of 2001. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, the convertible notes are subject to mandatory redemption upon 30 days notice by the issuer at any time after january 1, 2005 at 102%, 101% and 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest in years 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. the issuer must also offer to purchase the convertible notes from the holder in the event of a change in control of the issuer at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, the issuer has granted to the holder of the convertible notes certain anti-dilution rights. at the closing of the purchase of the first note, the initial conversion price (the "conversion price") was $10.00. the initial conversion price of the second note will be the conversion price of the first note on the date the second note is issued to king. the conversion price will be adjusted whenever the issuer is deemed to have issued or sold any shares of the common stock for a consideration per share that is less than the conversion price that is in effect immediately prior to any such issuance or sale. other events which may result in changes to the conversion price include the issuance of rights or options, the issuance of convertible securities, changes in option prices or conversion rates of convertible securities, the expiration of options and the failure to exercise convertible securities, among other things. if at any time between january 1, 2002 and december 31, 2004, the closing price of the common stock exceeds 180% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 30 trading days in any period of 45 consecutive trading days, the issuer may, within 20 business days after the end of such 45 day period, require the holder to convert the convertible notes into common stock at the conversion price in effect on the day of the conversion. subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the convertible notes, if the average closing price of the convertible notes exceeds the initial conversion price, the issuer will have the option of paying one-half of the interest due under the convertible notes in the form of common stock. king has no current plans to dispose of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of or as interest payments on the convertible notes. however, king in the future may dispose of such shares or other shares of common stock in the market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, if at any time the issuer grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of common stock, then each holder of the convertible notes will have the same rights on an as-if-converted basis. the issuer has also agreed that, prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets or other transaction in which holders of the common stock are entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for their common stock (an "organic change"), the issuer will take whatever action is necessary to insure that the holders of the convertible notes shall thereafter have the right to acquire or receive such shares of stock, securities or assets as such holder would have received in connection with such organic change if such holder had converted its convertible notes immediately prior to such organic change. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, if the fda shall not have accepted for filing the issuer's new drug application for estrasorb(tm) prior to june 1, 2002, then the holder of the convertible notes may accelerate the maturity of up to $5 million of the outstanding principal amount under the convertible notes. without the prior consent of the holders of a majority of the convertible notes, the common stock issued or issuable upon the conversion of the convertible notes and any securities issued with respect to the foregoing securities (collectively, the "purchaser securities"), the issuer is restricted under the investor rights agreement from taking certain actions. these actions include, without limitation and subject to specified exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness in excess of $1.5 million; the creation of certain liens; the acquisition of any business; the acquisition of assets in excess of $5 million; the entering into the active management or operation of any business that is unrelated to the current business of the issuer; election to make certain payments in cash rather than common stock; the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer; the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or certain other types of reorganization; the adoption of amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the issuer or otherwise take action which could reasonably be expected to affect adversely the rights of holders of the convertible notes. under the investor rights agreement, king has certain rights relating to the issuer's board of directors for so long as king and its affiliates collectively hold a majority of the purchaser securities. king is entitled to designate a board observer who shall be entitled to receive notice of any meeting or any proposed action by written consent of the issuer's board of directors and shall be entitled to attend any meeting of the issuer's board of directors. the convertible notes contain customary events of default. in the event of a default on the convertible notes, the issuer will take action to increase the size of its board of directors by one (1) member and to have a designee of king -4- 5 appointed to the issuer's board of directors for so long as the event of default is continuing. king's rights relating to the issuer's board terminate upon a change of control of king. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, king also has certain information and inspection rights. among other things, the issuer is required to deliver to king annual audited financial reports, quarterly unaudited financial reports, certain budgets and business plans, copies of all filings with the securities and exchange commission or any stock exchange, copies of press releases and copies of all financial statements, proxy statements, reports and any other general written communications sent by the issuer to its stockholders. king will be permitted to send a designee to inspect the properties of the issuer and its subsidiaries. the designee will be permitted to inspect and copy the corporate and financial records of the issuer and discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the issuer with the directors and executive officers of the issuer and its independent public accountants. king has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained by it pursuant to these rights. king also obtained an exclusive license from the issuer to use its proprietary cell line to develop and potentially commercialize recombinant human papillomavirus (hpv) virus-like particle (vlp) vaccines. the issuer and king are currently working together on manufacturing hpv-16 vlp vaccines being evaluated by the national cancer institute in clinical trials. pursuant to the license agreement, king has an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and market hpv-16 vlp vaccines for the prevention and/or treatment of hpv infection, except that the issuer retains the right to co-market any such product in the united states, including puerto rico. king will pay the issuer during the term of the license a royalty based on 17% of any net sales, less cost of goods, of any hpv product successfully developed under the license agreement. the term of king's license will continue for so long as the issuer's related cell line technology remains proprietary to the issuer, including pursuant to any existing patent or patent protection that must be sought under the terms of the license agreement. item 5. interest in securities of issuer. (a) the calculations in this item are based upon 21,590,573 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december 12, 2000 (based on disclosures made by the issuer in the note purchase agreement and including the 2,000,000 conversion shares. for purposes hereof, king is now the beneficial owner of 2,000,000 conversion shares, issuable upon the exercise of the first note, comprising 9.26% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the issuer. the foregoing calculation is made pursuant to rule 13d-3 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934. (b) king is the sole owner of the first note and, upon any exercise of the first note, king will also have the sole power to vote or to direct the vote, and the sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition, of all of the underlying conversion shares. (c) neither king nor, to king's knowledge, any of its directors or executive officers has effected any transactions in shares of the issuer's common stock or in any options or warrants to purchase such common stock in the past 60 days. (d) king affirms that no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares of the issuer's common stock beneficially owned by king. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. reference is made hereby to item 4 hereof which is incorporated by reference in this item 6. pursuant to a registration rights agreement between the issuer and king dated as of december 19, 2000 (the "registration rights agreement"), the issuer has agreed to file an initial shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") within ten business days of the closing of the sale of each of the convertible notes (the "initial shelf registration statements"). the initial shelf registration statement to be filed after the closing of the first note will cover the public offer and sale of the conversion shares issued or issuable upon the conversion of the first note and any additional shares of common stock received by the holders with respect to such shares pursuant to a subsequent stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization of the issuer. the initial shelf registration statement to be filed after the closing of the second note will cover the public offer and sale of the conversion shares issued or issuable upon the conversion of the second note and any additional shares of common stock received by the holders with respect to such shares pursuant to a subsequent stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization of the issuer. failure to have an initial shelf registration statement declared effective by the commission within 180 days after the issuance of the applicable convertible note constitutes an event of default under such convertible note. pursuant to registration rights agreement, at any time following the payment of interest in the form of common stock, the holders of a majority of the convertible notes then outstanding may request that the issuer file a shelf registration statement with the commission (the "top-up shelf registration statements"). the top-up registration statements will cover the public offer and sale of all common stock issued or issuable as interest payments on the convertible notes and any shares of common stock received by the holders with respect to such shares pursuant to a subsequent stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization of the issuer. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the issuer has also agreed to provide notice to the holders of the common stock issued or issuable under convertible notes of any proposed filing of a registration statement relating to a public offering of common stock for the issuer's own account or for the account of any other common stockholder. subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the registration rights agreement, if the issuer files such registration statement, the issuer will register any such common stock requested to be included in such registration by the holders thereof. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the issuer will maintain the effectiveness of each initial shelf registration statement and each top-up shelf registration statement until the earlier of the date on which the common stock registered thereunder has been sold pursuant to such registration statement or the date such common stock may be sold by the holders thereof pursuant to rule 144(k) under the securities act of 1933. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, neither king, nor to king's knowledge, any of its directors or executive officers have any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer. -5- 6 item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit description ------- ----------- 1 convertible note of novavax, inc., dated december 19, 2000 2 note purchase agreement by and between novavax, inc. and king pharmaceuticals, inc., dated as of december 19, 2000 3 investor rights agreement by and between novavax, inc. and king pharmaceuticals, inc., dated as of december 19, 2000 4 registration rights agreement by and between novavax, inc. and king pharmaceuticals, inc., dated as of december 19, 2000 -6- 7 signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. date: december 29, 2000 king pharmaceuticals, inc. by: /s/ john m. gregory ---------------------------------------- john m. gregory chairman of the board and chief executive officer 8 annex a directors and executive officers king pharmaceuticals, inc. the names, business addresses and present principal occupations of the directors and executive officers of king pharmaceuticals, inc.

(d) if the shares of common stock issuable by reason of conversion of notes are convertible into or exchangeable for any other stock or securities of the company, the company shall, at the converting holder's option, upon surrender of the notes to be converted by such holder as provided herein together with any notice, statement or payment required to effect such conversion or exchange of common stock, deliver to such holder or as otherwise specified by such holder a certificate or certificates representing the stock or securities into which the shares of common stock issuable by reason of such conversion are so convertible or exchangeable, registered in such name or names and in such denomination or denominations as such holder has specified. 2.5 adjustments to conversion price.

(b) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or sells any convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the "price per share for which common stock is issuable" shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issue or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of -12- 15 additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. for the purposes of this section 2.6(b), the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities for such price per share. no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made when common stock is actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustments of the conversion price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 2.5, no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (c) change in option price or conversion rate. if (i) the purchase price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock changes at any time, the conversion price in effect at the time of such change shall be immediately adjusted to the conversion price which would have been in effect at such time had such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, occurred at the time such options or convertible securities were initially granted, issued or sold. for purposes of this section 2.6, if the terms of any option or convertible security which was outstanding as of the closing date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such option or convertible security and the common stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change; provided that no such change shall at any time cause the conversion price hereunder to be increased. (d) treatment of expired options and unexercised convertible securities. upon the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible security without the exercise of any such option or right, the conversion price then in effect hereunder shall be adjusted immediately to the conversion price which would have been in effect had such option or convertible security, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued; provided that the expiration or termination of any option or convertible security which was outstanding as of the closing date shall not cause the conversion price hereunder to be adjusted unless, and only to the extent that, a change in the terms of such option or convertible security causes such option or convertible security to be deemed to have been issued after the closing date. -13- 16 (e) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, option or convertible security is issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the aggregate amount of cash received by the company therefor (net of discounts, commissions and related expenses). if any common stock, option or convertible security is issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of such consideration received by the company shall be the market price thereof as of the date of receipt. if any common stock, option or convertible security is issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the company is the surviving corporation, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity which is attributable to such common stock, option or convertible security, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash and securities shall be determined jointly by the company and the holders of a majority of the notes. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time, the fair value of such consideration shall be determined by an independent appraiser experienced in valuing such type of consideration jointly selected by the company and the holders of a majority of the notes. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. (f) integrated transactions. in case any option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together constituting one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such option by the parties thereto, the option shall be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. (g) treasury shares. the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company or any subsidiary, and the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or sale of common stock. (h) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling such holders (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or in convertible securities or (ii) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or upon the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. -14- 17 2.7. subdivision or combination of common stock. if the company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and if the company at any time combines (by reverse stock split, reclassification or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. 2.8. reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets or other transaction, in each case which is effected in such a manner that the holders of common stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for common stock, is referred to herein as an "organic change". prior to the consummation of any organic change, the company shall make appropriate provisions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the notes) to insure that each of the holders of notes shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive, in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the shares of common stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the conversion of such holder's notes, such shares of stock, securities or assets as such holder would have received in connection with such organic change if such holder had converted its notes immediately prior to such organic change. in each such case, the company shall also make appropriate provisions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the notes) to insure that the provisions of this section 2 and section 4 and section 5 shall thereafter be applicable to the notes (including, in the case of any such consolidation, merger or sale in which the successor entity or purchasing entity is other than the company, an immediate adjustment of the conversion price to the value for the common stock reflected by the terms of such consolidation, merger or sale, and a corresponding immediate adjustment in the number of shares of common stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of notes, if the value so reflected is less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or sale). the company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the -15- 18 notes), the obligation to deliver to each such holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire. 2.9. certain events. if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 2 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the board of directors shall make an appropriate adjustment in the conversion price so as to protect the rights of the holders of the notes; provided that no such adjustment shall increase the conversion price as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 2 or decrease the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any note. 2.10. notices.

provided, however, that the liability of each holder hereunder shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds (after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by such holder) received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement. 6.3 indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification under section 6.1 or section 6.2 agrees to give prompt written notification to the indemnifying party after the receipt by such indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement; provided that failure to give such notification shall not affect the obligations of the indemnifying party pursuant to section 6.1, section 6.2 or section 6.4 except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure; provided, further, that if the indemnified party shall fail to provide such notice to the indemnifying party, then the -12- 15 indemnifying party shall not be required to pay the costs and expenses of such indemnified party incurred by such indemnified party during the period commencing on the date such indemnified party was required to provide such notice to the indemnifying party and ending on the date that the indemnifying party has knowledge of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under these indemnification provisions for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest is likely to exist, based on the written opinion of counsel, between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. in the event of such a conflict of interest, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of (a) more than one counsel for all holders of registrable securities who are indemnified parties, which counsel shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement who are indemnified parties (and which selection shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company), (b) more than one counsel for any underwriters or (c) more than one counsel for the company in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claims, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party, based on the written opinion of counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. in the event of such a conflict of interest, the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels, provided that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of (a) more than one counsel for all holders of registrable securities who are indemnified parties, which counsel shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement who are indemnified parties (and which selection shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company), (b) more than one counsel for any underwriters or (c) more than one counsel for the company in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions. no indemnifying party, in defense of any such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or entry into any settlement which does not include as an -13- 16 unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the extent the same is covered by the indemnity obligations set forth in section 6.1 or section 6.2. no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of each indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 6.4 contribution. if the indemnification from the indemnifying party provided for in section 6.1 or section 6.2 is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that the liability of each holder hereunder shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds (after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by such holder) received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by the applicable registration statement. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 6.3, any legal or other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 6.5 other liability. the provisions of sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 shall be in addition to any liability which any indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party and shall survive the termination of this agreement. 7. miscellaneous. ------------- 7.1 assignment. the registration rights contained in section 3 may be transferred by a holder in connection with the transfer by such holder of the registrable securities to which such registration rights relate. as a condition -14- 17 to the effectiveness of any such transfer of registration rights hereunder, the transferee shall execute a counterpart of, and shall become a party to, this agreement. 7.2 reports under the exchange act. the company agrees to: ------------------------------ (a) file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by the company under the exchange act;

prospectus and, to the extent permitted by their registration rights agreement with the company, by their donees or transferees and their other successors in interest. the selling stockholders may sell their shares at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices, or at fixed prices, which may be changed. each selling stockholder reserves the right to accept or reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of shares, whether the purchase is to be made directly or through agents. the selling stockholders may offer their shares at various times in one or more of the following transactions: o in ordinary brokers' transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; o in transactions involving cross or block trades or otherwise on the nasdaq national market or any national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed; o in transactions "at the market" to or through market makers in the common stock or into an existing market for the common stock; o in other ways not involving market makers or established trading markets, including direct sales of the shares to purchasers or sales of the shares effected through agents; o through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives which may or may not be listed on an exchange; o in privately negotiated transactions; or o in a combination of any of the foregoing transactions. the selling stockholders also may sell their shares in accordance with rule 144 under the securities act. from time to time, one or more of the selling stockholders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares owned by them. if the selling stockholders default in performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares from time to time by -i- 23 this prospectus. the selling stockholders also may transfer and donate shares in other circumstances. the number of shares beneficially owned by selling stockholders will decrease as and when the selling stockholders transfer or donate their shares or default in performing obligations secured by their shares. the plan of distribution for the shares offered and sold under this prospectus will otherwise remain unchanged, except that the transferees, donees, pledgees, other secured parties or other successors in interest will be selling stockholders for purposes of this prospectus. a selling stockholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers. a selling stockholder also may enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that involve the delivery of shares to the broker-dealers, who may then resell or otherwise transfer such shares. in addition, a selling stockholder may loan or pledge shares to a broker-dealer, which may sell the loaned shares or, upon a default by the selling stockholder of the secured obligation, may sell or otherwise transfer the pledged shares. the selling stockholders may use brokers, dealers, underwriters or agents to sell their shares. the persons acting as agents may receive compensation in the form of commissions, discounts or concessions. this compensation may be paid by the selling stockholders or the purchasers of the shares of whom such persons may act as agent, or to whom they may sell as principal, or both. the compensation as to a particular person may be less than or in excess of customary commissions. the selling stockholders and any agents or broker-dealers that participate with the selling stockholders in the offer and sale of the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the securities act. any commissions they receive and any profit they realize on the resale of the shares by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the securities act. neither we nor any selling stockholders can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. if a selling stockholder sells shares in an underwritten offering, the underwriters may acquire the shares for their own account and resell the shares from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. in such event, we will set forth in a supplement to this prospectus the names of the underwriters and the terms of the transactions, including any underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions and other items constituting compensation of the underwriters and broker-dealers. the underwriters from time to time may change any public offering price and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-dealers. unless otherwise set forth in a supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the shares specified in the supplement if they purchase any of the shares. exhibit a - page ii 24 we have informed the selling stockholders that during such time as they may be engaged in a distribution of the shares, they are required to comply with regulation m under the securities exchange act. with exceptions, regulation m prohibits any selling stockholder, any affiliated purchasers and other persons who participate in such a distribution from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase, any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. under the company's registration rights agreement with the selling stockholders, the company is required to bear the expenses relating to this offering, excluding any underwriting discounts or commissions, stock transfer taxes and fees and disbursements of counsel to the selling stockholders. the company has agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders and their respective controlling persons against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the securities act. the company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling stockholders of the shares offered by this document. this offering by any selling stockholder will terminate on the date specified in the selling stockholder's registration rights agreement with the company, or, if earlier, on the date on which the selling stockholder has sold all of such selling stockholder's shares. exhibit a - page iii -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
