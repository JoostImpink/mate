the holder would beneficially own in excess of the holder beneficial ownership limitation (as defined below) or (ii) the holder, together with the holder&rsquo;s affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder&rsquo;s affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of the affiliates beneficial ownership limitation (as defined below). for purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of common stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion

unconverted portion of any other securities of the company (including, without limitation, any other securities of the company which would entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time common stock, including, without limitation, any debt, preferred stock, right, option, warrant or other instrument that is at any time convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the holder thereof to receive, common stock, hereinafter &ldquo; common stock equivalents &rdquo;) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the holder or any of its affiliates. except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with section 13(d) of the 1934 act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the holder that the company is not representing to the holder that such calculation is in compliance with section 13(d) of the 1934 act and the holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. to the extent that the limitation contained in this section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the holder together with any affiliates) and of which portion of this warrant is exercisable shall be in the reasonable judgment of the holder, in each case subject to the holder beneficial ownership limitation or the affiliates beneficial ownership limitation, and the company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. in addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with section 13(d) of the 1934 act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. for purposes of this section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of common stock, a holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of common stock as reflected in (a) the company&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the commission, as the case may be, (b) a more recent public announcement by the company or (c) a more recent written notice by the company or the transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of common stock outstanding. upon the written or oral request of a holder, the company shall within one (1) trading day confirm orally and in writing to the holder the number of shares of common stock then outstanding. in any case, the number of outstanding shares of common stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the company, including this warrant, by the holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of common stock was reported. the &ldquo; holder beneficial ownership limitation &rdquo; shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant (including shares issuable upon conversion of warrant shares issued upon exercise). the &ldquo; affiliates beneficial ownership limitation &rdquo; shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant (including shares issuable upon conversion of warrant shares issued upon exercise). the holder beneficial ownership limitation together with the affiliates beneficial ownership limitation is collectively known as the &ldquo; beneficial ownership limitation .&rdquo; the provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. the limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this warrant and shall cease to apply only (x) upon sixty-one (61) days&rsquo; written notice from the holder to the company of an election to increase or decrease or remove one or both of the holder beneficial ownership limitation and the affiliate beneficial ownership limitation or (y) immediately upon written notice from the holder to the company at any time after the public announcement or other disclosure of a fundamental transaction (as defined in section 3(c)). 5 section 3. certain adjustments . a) stock dividends and splits . if the company, at any time while this warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions of shares of its common stock to the record holders of common stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of common stock issued by the company upon exercise of this warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the common stock any shares of capital stock of the company, then in each case the exercise price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate exercise price of this warrant shall remain unchanged in the case of an exercise for common stock only. in the event that any adjustment of the exercise price required herein results in a fraction of a cent, the exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest one hundredth of a cent. any adjustment made pursuant to this section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. 6 b) pro rata distributions . if the company, at any time while this warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of common stock (and not to the holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security of the company other than the common stock (which shall be subject to section 3(b)) (a &ldquo; distribution &rdquo;), then in each such case the holder shall be entitled to participate in such distribution to the same extent that the holder would have participated therein if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including, without limitation, the beneficial ownership limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock are to be determined for the participation in such distribution (provided, however, to the extent that the holder&rsquo;s right to participate in any such distribution would result in the holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation, then the holder shall not be entitled to participate in such distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock as a result of such distribution to such extent) and the portion of such distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation). to the extent that this warrant has not been exercised at the time of such distribution, such portion of the distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the holder until the holder has exercised this warrant. c) fundamental transaction . if, at any time while this warrant is outstanding, (i) the company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the company with or into another person pursuant to which the shares of capital stock of the company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation are converted into or exchanged for shares of another company or entity and represent, or are converted into or exchanged for equity securities that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, less than a majority, by voting power, of the equity securities of (1) the surviving or resulting party or (2) if the surviving or resulting party is a wholly owned subsidiary of another party immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent of such surviving or resulting party, (ii) the company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions and the consideration is distributed to holders of common stock, (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer by the company is completed pursuant to which holders of common stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock, (iv) the company effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement with another person or group of persons whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock (not including any shares of common stock held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement) (each a &ldquo; fundamental transaction &rdquo;), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this warrant, the holder shall have the right to receive, for each warrant share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such fundamental transaction, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring company or of the company, if it is the surviving company, and any additional consideration (the &ldquo; alternate consideration &rdquo;) receivable by holders of common stock as a result of such fundamental transaction by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. for purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the exercise price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such alternate consideration based on the amount of alternate consideration issuable in respect of one share of common stock in such fundamental transaction, and the company shall apportion the exercise price among the alternate consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the alternate consideration. if holders of common stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a fundamental transaction, then the holder shall be given the same choice as to the alternate consideration it receives upon any exercise of this warrant following such fundamental transaction. 7 d) calculations . all calculations under this section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. for purposes of this section 3, the number of shares of common stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. e) notice to holder . whenever the exercise price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this section 3, the company shall promptly mail to the holder a notice setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of warrant shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. f) adjustments . in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section 3, the holder shall, upon exercise of this warrant, become entitled to receive securities or assets (other than common stock) then, wherever appropriate, all references herein to shares of common stock shall be deemed to refer to and include such shares and/or other securities or assets; and thereafter the number of such shares and/or other securities or assets shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and upon terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions of this section 3. section 4. transfer of warrant . a) transferability . subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws, this warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any

prior notice to the company, may increase the beneficial ownership limitation provisions of this section 2(e), provided that the beneficial ownership limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant held by the holder and the provisions of this section 2(e) shall continue to apply. any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the company. the provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. the limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this warrant. 5 section 3. certain adjustments .
