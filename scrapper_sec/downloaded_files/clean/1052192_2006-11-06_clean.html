(iv) the preferred shares would have a &#147;face value&#148; per share equal to the transaction price and would entitle the holder to cumulative, compound dividends (accruing from the date of closing of the transaction) at a rate equal to 9.9% per annum. no dividends would be paid on the preferred shares until the end of the fifth year after the date of closing of the transaction (or, if later, the issuance of the preferred shares upon conversion of the series a vmvs), at which time dividends would begin to be paid on a current basis. one-third of the dividends accrued and compounded before the fifth anniversary of the date of closing of the transaction would be paid at the end of each of the fifth, sixth and seventh years after the date of closing of the transaction (with unpaid dividends continuing to compound to the date of such payment). the preferred shares would be redeemable for their face v alue and accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption (i) at the option of the holder or four seasons at any times beginning on the fifth anniversary of the date of closing the transaction, provided that at the end of the sixth and seventh years after the date of closing the transaction, respectively, no more than one-third and two-thirds of the maximum number of preferred shares into which the series a vmvs may be converted (regardless of the number of preferred shares actually issued) shall have been redeemed, (ii) at the option of the holder at any time if mr. sharp ceased to be either the chief executive officer or the chairman as a result of a breach by a party other than mr. sharp of agreements relating to mr. sharp&#146;s tenure in those positions, and (iii) in whole at the option of four seasons if, beginning on the fifth anniversary of the date of closing of the transaction, the holder did not consent to four seasons or its subsidiaries incurring indebtedness for borrowed money that had be en approved as a &#147;material decision&#148; (as provided in part c, below). while all or any portion of the preferred shares remain outstanding, no indebtedness for borrowed money that was not subordinated to the preferred shares could be incurred by four seasons or its subsidiaries without mr. sharp&#146;s consent. (mr. sharp would pre-approve the debt associated with the implementation of the transaction, up to us$750 million of acquisition financing and a us$200 million evergreen operating facility with one or more banks, as &#147;permitted senior debt&#148;.) the final structure would address the commercial and tax efficiencies associated with achieving the overall economic objective of the transaction. 3. commitment of chairman and chief executive officer: mr. sharp would agree to continue in his current capacity as chief executive officer for at least three years. thereafter, at his option, mr. sharp would advise the board of directors regarding further extensions of his service as chief executive officer. mr. sharp would continue as the chairman while he is chief executive officer and, at his option, after he ceases to be chief executive officer. mr. sharp would tender his resignation as chief executive officer and chairman if mr. sharp/triples disposed of all or substantially all of their equity interest in four seasons (other than pursuant to a pro rata secondary public offering or private placement by mr. sharp/triples and the lead investors participating in the offering). the continuing chief executive officer and chairman&#146;s roles contemplated for mr. sharp are outlined in part b, below. 4. governance: the governance structure for four seasons would be established pursuant to a shareholders agreement among four seasons, the lead investors, mr. sharp and triples. the basic terms of the shareholders agreement are outlined in part c, below. 5. mechanism for implementation: it is contemplated that the transaction would be implemented through a shareholder-approved corporate transaction, such as an amalgamation or a plan of arrangement approved by shareholders and the court. b. position description of chief executive officer and chairman of the board chief executive officer general as chief executive officer, mr. sharp would continue to have responsibility for providing the strategic and aesthetic vision for four seasons and overseeing the day-to-day management of the business of the company in accordance with its strategic plans and annual budgets as reviewed and, as necessary, approved by the board. specific responsibilities without limitation, as chief executive officer, mr. sharp would have responsibility, as currently is the case, to: &#149;
