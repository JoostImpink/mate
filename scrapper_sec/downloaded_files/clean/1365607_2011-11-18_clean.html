investors, &#148; and each, an &#147; investor &#148; ) has entered into a shareholder agreement (together, the &#147; shareholders agreements , &#148; and each, a &#147; shareholder agreement &#148; ) with the issuer on november 16, 2009. the shareholder agreements define the &#147; first restricted period &#148; as the period prior to january 2, 2011, the &#147; second restricted period &#148; as the period beginning on january 2, 2011 and ending three months thereafter, and the &#147; third restricted period &#148; as the period beginning on january 2, 2012 and ending three months thereafter. the first restricted period, the second restricted period, and the third restricted period are collectively known as the &#147; restricted period . &#148; pursuant to the shareholders agreements, without the prior written consent of the issuer, each investor agreed not to, (a) during the first restricted period, transfer any of its common shares constituting the initial share consideration received by an investor or beneficially owned by such investor, (b) during the second restricted period, transfer any of its common shares constituting the first deferred share consideration received by an investor or beneficially owned by such investor, and (c) during the third restricted period, transfer any of its common shares constituting the second deferred share consideration received by an investor or beneficially owned by such investor; provided, however, that after july 2, 2010, the transfer restriction in this paragraph shall not apply to any transfers of an investor &#146; s common shares pursuant to the exercise of such investor &#146; s &#147; piggyback registrations &#148; rights (as defined below under the registration rights agreement) to a registration of the issuer &#146; s common shares or american depositary shares ( &#147; adss &#148; ) effected by the issuer for its own account. in addition, during the restricted period, each investor agreed not to commence, make, engage in, encourage, facilitate, or in any way participate in, any proxy solicitation contrary to the management of the issuer (including by written consent), or agree or announce its intention to vote with any person engaging in any such proxy solicitation, or seek to influence, advise, encourage, or direct the vote of any person with respect to the voting of any of such investor &#146; s common shares in support of any such proxy solicitation. despite the expiration of the first restricted period and the demands of the investors, issuer has refused to remove the restrictive legend printed on the certificates representing the common shares held by the investors and to cooperate with the investors &#146; exercise of their rights to have the common shares held by the investors registered as adss tradeable on nasdaq. as a result, the investors currently hold common shares that cannot be sold or traded. the investors and the shareholder representative are pursuing a claim against the issuer to have the restricted legends removed from the certificates representing their common shares. registration rights agreement demand registrations the investors and the issuer have entered into a certain registration rights agreement on november 16, 2009 (the &#147; registration rights agreement &#148; ). pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the issuer agreed to prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on form f-3 pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the &#147; securities act &#148; ) covering the resale of the investors &#146; common shares and any other shares of capital stock issued as (or issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any warrant, right or other security which is issued as) a dividend or other distribution with respect to or in exchange for or in replacement of such common shares ( &#147; registrable securities &#148; ) equal to (i) the aggregate number of common shares issued on january 2, 2010 under the merger agreement and (ii) the number of shares of registrable securities that would be issuable following january 2, 2010 under the merger agreement if the investors elect to receive the first deferred share consideration and the second deferred share consideration under the merger agreement. in the event that form f-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of registrable securities, the issuer shall (x) register the resale of the registrable securities on another appropriate form reasonably acceptable to the required holders and (y) undertake to register the registrable securities on form f-3 as soon as such form is available, provided that the issuer shall maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement then in effect until such time as a registration statement on form f-3 covering the registrable securities has been declared effective by the commission or is no longer required to be maintained effective. piggyback registrations also pursuant to the registration rights agreement, subject to underwriting requirements and the shareholder agreements, if the issuer proposes to register (excluding for this purpose a registration effected by the issuer solely for shareholders other than the investors) any of its common shares or adss on a registration statement in connection with the public offering of such ordinary shares or adss, the issuer shall promptly give each investor written notice of such registration and, upon the written request of any investor given within ten days after delivery of such notice, the issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include in such registration any registrable securities thereby requested by such investor. if an investor decides not to include all or any of its registrable securities in such registration by the issuer, such investor shall continue to have the right to include any registrable securities in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by the issuer with respect to offerings of its ordinary shares or adss. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 99.1. joint filing agreement dated november 15, 2011, among the reporting persons. exhibit 99.2. power of attorney &#150;

s january 2010 acquisition of dmg. we are gravely concerned about the future of this company and believe that the board of directors needs to make major changes both in its direction and management, including the replacement of chairman li. it is our opinion that chairman li has consistently mismanaged the company in recent years. for example: &#183; in mid-2008, visionchina bought six smaller advertising companies, structuring the deals based on &#147; earnouts, &#148; which resulted in an $89.1 million impairment write-down in july 2010. &#183; after acquiring the dmg subway advertising business, visionchina inexplicably fired most of the key sales team and failed to devote the resources needed to successfully operate that business, resulting in a botched post-merger integration. &#183; since scott chen &#146; s resignation as cfo in august 2010, mr. li has not hired a cfo for a period that has now been 15 months. there is no one else on the management team at visionchina who has enough professional experience to stand up and question these poor decisions. &#183; under mr. li &#146; s stewardship, visionchina &#146; s share price has plummeted from $22.38 on august 1, 2008 to $1.52 on november 11, 2011,. our own direct experience with mr. li since the dmg acquisition provides further insight into how badly visionchina is being run today. as you know, our companies, oak investment partners and gobi partners (oak and gobi), sued visionchina for willfully reneging on the first of two $30 million payments (after making its initial $100 million payment) in connection with visionchina &#146; s $160 million acquisition of digital media group company limited (dmg) in 2009. visionchina filed a lawsuit against for fraud and sought to defend against oak and gobi &#146; s affirmative claims for payment based on the same purported fraud. (it is our belief that from the start, mr. li &#146; s goal has been to simply avoid or delay paying the additional $60 million in purchase price he agreed to pay the dmg shareholders at the time of the acquisition.) on november 4 th , after 11 months &#146; time, the new york state supreme court dismissed all fraud charges against oak and gobi, writing: &#147; &#133; it is plain that visonchina is not able to maintain a viable cause of action for fraud (against oak and gobi). &#148; we believe this ruling validates our assertion that visionchina &#146; s lawsuit was of no benefit to the company or its shareholders. to the contrary, we believe the facts will show that visionchina &#146; s lawsuit resulted in vast amounts of wasted time, energy and money that visionchina management should have been spending to build the business. the court also granted the dmg shareholders &#146; motion to attach $30 million of visionchina &#146; s assets because we &#147; have demonstrated that it is more likely than not [the dmg shareholders] will succeed on the merit of [their] claims. &#148; the final $30 million payment is due on november 16, 2011, and assuming visionchina fails to pay that as well, we will ask the court to expand the attachment of vision china &#146; s assets to include that amount. our total damages exceed $90 million and we intend to ask the court for an award consistent with that figure. we want to be clear: our request that the board replace chairman li is not being made because we are angry that he failed to honor the company &#146; s agreement with us with respect to its acquisition of dmg or, because we believe he filed what has been shown to be a frivolous lawsuit against our companies. rather it is being made because as shareholders, we believe mismanagement of the company, as detailed above, has become endemic to the company under his leadership. mr. li &#146; s actions with respect to the dmg acquisition are but one example. we strongly believe that visionchina has a very solid core business with a terrific foundation in the key tier-1 chinese subway and bus-based advertising markets upon which to build an exciting high-growth business. that &#146; s the vision for the combined company we believed in when we agreed to sell dmg to visionchina several years ago and to take a substantial amount of visionchina stock as part of the purchase consideration. that vision has gone largely unrealized in the last two years because of visionchina &#146; s inability to execute on that vision, even during this time of robust growth in the china advertising market. right now, it is manifestly obvious that the market no longer believes in mr. li &#146; s leadership of this company &#150; the visn stock price is trading, and has been trading for many months, at a level so low compared to its revenues that it clearly shows that investors have all but given up on this management team. it is now time for the visionchina board to step up and find new management for this company, starting with chairman li. we as shareholders of visionchina believe that you must exercise your fiduciary duties as a board of directors to prevent the company and its shareholders from suffering further damage. we look forward to hearing from you soon. sincerely, /s/ ren riley /s/ thomas g. tsao ren riley thomas g. tsao oak investment partners xii, l.p. gobi partners, inc.
