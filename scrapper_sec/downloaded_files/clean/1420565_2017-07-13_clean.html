provided that, in the event that such tender offer, merger, consolidation or other such transaction is not completed, such securities held by the undersigned shall remain subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this lock-up agreement (for purposes hereof, &#147;change of control&#148; shall mean the transfer (whether by tender offer, merger, consolidation or other similar transaction), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons, of shares of capital stock if, after such transfer, such person or group of affiliated persons would hold more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the company (or the surviving entity)). notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall prevent the undersigned from establishing a 10b5-l trading plan that complies with rule 10b5-l under the exchange act (&#147;10b5-l trading plan&#148;) or from amending an existing 10b5-l trading plan so long as there are no sales of lock-up securities under such plan during the lock-up period; and provided that, the establishment of a 10b5-1 trading plan or the amendment of a 10b5-l trading plan, in either case, providing for sales of lock-up securities shall only be permitted if (i) the establishment or amendment of such plan is not required to be reported in any public report or filing with the sec, or otherwise, and (ii) the undersigned does not otherwise voluntarily effect any public filing or report regarding the establishment or amendment of such plan. furthermore, during the lock-up period, the undersigned may sell shares of common stock of the company purchased by the undersigned in the offering from the underwriters (other than any issuer-directed shares of common stock purchased in the offering by an officer or director of the company) or on the open market following the offering if and only if (i) such sales are not required to be reported in any public report or filing with the sec, or otherwise and (ii) the undersigned does not otherwise voluntarily effect any public filing or report regarding such sales. the undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the company&#146;s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the lock-up securities except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions. in the event that during the lock-up period, the representatives waive any prohibition on the transfer of lock-up securities held by any record or beneficial holder of the shares of capital stock of the company, the representatives shall be deemed to have also waived for each major holder (as defined below), on the same terms, the prohibitions set forth in the lock-up agreement that would otherwise have applied to such major holder with respect to the same percentage of such major holder&#146;s lock-up securities as the relative percentage of aggregate lock-up securities held by such party receiving the waiver which are subject to such waiver. the provisions of this paragraph will not apply: (1) unless and until the representatives have first waived more than 1.0% of the company&#146;s total outstanding shares of common stock (determined as of the date of such waiver and assuming conversion, exercise and exchange of all securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock) from such prohibitions, (2) (a) if the waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer not involving a disposition for value and (b) the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same terms described in this lock-up agreement to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time of the transfer, or (3) if the waiver is granted to a holder of lock-up securities in connection with a follow-on public offering of the company&#146;s securities pursuant to a registration statement on form s-1 that is filed with the sec, provided that such waiver shall only apply with respect to such holder&#146;s participation in such follow-on public sale. in the event that, as a result of this paragraph, any lock-up securities held by the undersigned are released from the restrictions imposed by this lock-up agreement, the representatives shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the company within two business days of the effective date of such release, and the company, in turn, in consultation with the representatives, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the major holders within one business day thereafter that the same percentage of aggregate lock-up securities held by such major holders has been released; provided that the failure to give such notice to the company or the major holders shall not give rise to any claim or liability against the company or the underwriters, including the representatives. notwithstanding any other provisions of this lock-up agreement, if the representatives, in their reasonable judgment, after consultation with the company, determine that a record or beneficial owner of any lock-up securities should be granted an early release from a lock-up agreement due to circumstances of an emergency or hardship, then the major holders shall not have any right to be granted an cusip no. 00887a 105 page 15 of 16 pages early release pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. for purposes of this lock-up agreement, each of the following persons is a &#147;major holder&#148;: each record or beneficial owner, as of the date hereof, of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company on an as-converted to common stock basis (for purposes of determining record or beneficial ownership of a stockholder, all shares of capital stock held by investment funds affiliated with such stockholder shall be aggregated). the undersigned understands that, if (1) the execution of the underwriting agreement in connection with the offering shall not have occurred on or before december 31, 2017, (2) the company files an application to withdraw the registration statement relating to the offering, (3) the underwriting agreement (other than the provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the common stock to be sold thereunder or (4) the representatives, on behalf of the underwriters, advise the company, or the company advises the representatives, in writing, prior to the execution of the underwriting agreement, that they have determined not to proceed with the offering, the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this agreement.
