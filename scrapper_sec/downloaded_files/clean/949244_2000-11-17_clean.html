mirror company (&#147;tmc&#148;) on september 1, 1999 (the &#147;schedule 13d&#148;) and in order to file two agreements as exhibits. by virtue of the merger of tmc with and into tribune on june 12, 2000, tribune became the successor in interest to the securities of alternate marketing networks, inc., a michigan corporation (the &#147;issuer&#148;), to which this amendment relates. item 1. security and issuer . the title and class of the equity securities to which this amendment relates is the common stock, no par value (the &#147;common stock&#148;), of the issuer. the principal executive offices of the issuer are located at one ionia s.w., suite 300, grand rapids, mi 49503. item 2. identity and background . tribune is a media company. through its subsidiaries, tribune publishes newspapers in print and digital formats, and broadcasts, develops and distributes information and entertainment principally in metropolitan areas in the united states. the principal business and office address of tribune is tribune company, 435 north michigan avenue, chicago, illinois 60611. tribune&#146;s principal internet site is www.tribune.com. the names, addresses, offices and citizenship of the directors and executive officers of tribune are set forth on annex i hereto. neither tribune nor, to the knowledge of tribune, any of the its executive officers or directors, during the last five years, has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration . as described in the original schedule 13d, on august 20, 1999 (a) tmc and the issuer entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the issuance by the issuer to tmc of 350,000 shares of common stock (the &#147;issuer shares&#148;) in exchange for $1,050,000 and (b) tmc and edelson technology partners ii, l.p., a delaware limited partnership (&#147;edelson&#148;), entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the purchase by tmc of 339,552 shares of common stock held by edelson (the &#147;edelson shares,&#148; and together with the issuer shares, the &#147;shares&#148;) for a purchase price of $933,768. the source of funds used to purchase the shares was the working capital of tmc. cusip no. 01245p 13d page 4 of 9 pages item 4. purpose of transaction . on september 10, 1999, tmc and the issuer entered into a shareholder agreement (the &#147;shareholder agreement&#148;), a copy of which is filed herewith as exhibit 99.3. pursuant to the shareholder agreement, the number of seats on the issuer&#146;s board of directors was increased from four to five. tmc had the right to nominate a director to fill the newly created board seat and to nominate a director to fill a vacancy created by the resignation from the board of directors of harry edelson. tribune may purchase additional shares of common stock in the future through open- market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the statement in the prior sentence shall not be considered a tender offer to purchase any additional shares of common stock. other than as described above, tribune has no plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d (although it reserves the right to develop such plans). item 5. interest in securities of the issuer . see rows 7 through 11 and row 13 on page 2. the issuer&#146;s quarterly report on form 10-qsb for the quarterly period ended september 30, 2000 states that, as of october 31, 2000, there were 4,689,105 shares of common stock outstanding. the percentage ownership of tribune was derived using this number of shares of common stock outstanding. during the sixty-day period preceding the date of the filing of this amendment, tribune did not acquire any shares of common stock. no other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the common stock beneficially owned by tribune. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer . pursuant to the shareholder agreement, in the event that the issuer desires to issue and sell additional shares of common stock in a public or private offering for cash (an &#147;offering&#148;), tribune has the right to purchase such number of shares to maintain its then current percentage ownership interest in the issuer and to prevent any dilution of its percentage ownership interest in the issuer that would otherwise occur as a result of any such offering. in addition, tribune has a preemptive right to purchase additional shares of common stock, so long as the shares of common stock sold to tribune, when aggregated with the shares already held by tribune, do not result in tribune owning 45% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock. cusip no. 01245p 13d page 5 of 9 pages on september 10, 1999, tmc and the issuer also entered into a registration rights agreement (the &#147;registration rights agreement&#148;), a copy of which is filed herewith as exhibit 99.4. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, if tribune requests that the issuer register its shares of common stock in an underwritten offering, the issuer is required to register such shares under the securities act of 1933 (the &#147;securities act&#148;) as expeditiously as practicable. tribune has two such demand registration rights. the issuer must bear all expenses incident to any registration effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement, including the fees and expenses of a single counsel retained by tribune; however, tribune is responsible for the underwriting discounts and commissions in connection with any of the shares of common stock sold by tribune. tribune is entitled to customary indemnification from the issuer against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the securities act. in addition, the registration rights agreement grants tribune a &#147;piggyback&#148; registration right to include its shares of common stock on a pro rata basis in any registration effected for the account of the issuer or any other person. all fees, costs and expenses of such registration (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) will be borne by the issuer. tribune is entitled to customary indemnification from

company has not yet filed a registration statement pursuant to article iii at the time of a withdrawal by a holder, such registration right shall be restored to such holder and shall not be counted for purposes of section 3.1(a) so long as the holder reimburses the company for all registration expenses with respect to such withdrawn registration; provided , however, that the holder shall not be responsible for the payment of any other registration expenses for any subsequent registrations except as provided in this section 5.2. article vi indemnification and contribution 6.1. indemnification by the company . the company shall, notwithstanding termination of this agreement and without limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, each holder of eligible securities, the officers, directors, partners, agents, investment advisors and employees of each of them, each person who controls any such holder (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and the officers, directors, partners, agents and employees of each such controlling person, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection therewith) and expenses, including expenses of investigation (collectively, &#147; losses &#148;), as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the extent that (a) the untrue statement or omission in the form of a preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final prospectus or in a post-effective supplement or amendment thereto, or (b) such are based upon information regarding such holder furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use therein to the extent that such information was reasonably relied on by the company in the preparation thereof. the obligations of the company to each indemnified party shall be separate obligations, and the liability of the company to any indemnified party hereunder shall not be extinguished solely because any other indemnified party is not entitled to indemnity hereunder. 6.2. indemnification by holder of eligible securities . in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of eligible securities is participating, such holder of eligible securities shall furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any registration statement or prospectus and each holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of each such controlling person, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against all losses (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment not subject to appeal or review) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or form of prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus and that such information was reasonably relied upon by the company in preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or form of prospectus. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder of eligible securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the eligible securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 6.3. conduct of indemnification proceedings . if any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an &#147; indemnified party &#148;), such indemnified party promptly shall so notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the &#147; indemnifying party &#148;) in writing, and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith; provided , that the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations pursuant to this article vi, except to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to review or appeal) that such failure shall have materially prejudiced the indemnifying party, and provided further , that such failure to give notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than under this article vi. any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless: (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii) the indemnifying parties shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or parties in any such action, claim or proceeding; or (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party or parties and one or more of the indemnifying parties, and such indemnified parties shall have been advised in writing by counsel that a conflict of interest may exist if such counsel represents such indemnified party or parties and one or more of the indemnifying parties (in which case, if any such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying parties in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying parties, the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying parties), it being understood, however, that, the indemnifying parties shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding made without its written consent. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any proceeding unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or may be the subject matter of such proceeding. all fees and expenses of each indemnified party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this article vi) shall be paid to such indemnified party, as incurred, upon written notice thereof to the indemnifying parties (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). 6.4. contribution . if a claim by an indemnified party for indemnification under section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof is found unenforceable in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal or review) even though the express provisions hereof provide for indemnification in such case, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of each such indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 6.3 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 6.4, an indemnifying party that is a holder of eligible securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the securities sold by such indemnifying party and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 10(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article vii hold-back agreements 7.1. restrictions on sale by holders of eligible securities . each holder of eligible securities agrees, if requested (pursuant to a written notice received by such holder no more than 60 nor fewer than 10

or (ii) equity securities of the company having a fair market value, both at the time of receipt of the request and at the time of the filing of the registration statement, of at least $5 million, not

common stock during the period beginning ten (10) days prior to, and ending ninety (90) days after, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such registration statement ( provided , however , that such period shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of any notice pursuant to section 5.1(c) hereof to and including the date when each seller of eligible securities covered by such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5.1(g) hereof). article viii underwritten offerings 8.1. selection of underwriters . if any of the eligible securities covered by any registration statement filed pursuant to article iii hereof, or pursuant to article iv hereof in connection with a secondary offering, are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be selected by (i) in the case of any registration statement filed pursuant to article iii hereof, the holders of a majority of outstanding eligible securities included in such offering and (ii) in the case of any registration statement pursuant to article iv hereof, by the company or in such other manner as the company may agree. no person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person&#146;s eligible securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. article ix rule 144

is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any holder of eligible securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to rule 144. the company further covenants that it will take such further action as any holder of eligible securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell eligible securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144. upon the request of any holder of eligible securities, the company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. the company shall have no obligation to register any eligible securities at the request or demand of a holder if, at the time of the request or demand for registration, the holder could sell all of the eligible securities in a single transaction under rule 144. article x miscellaneous 10.1. remedies . in the event of a breach by the company, or by a holder of eligible securities, of any of its obligations under this agreement, each holder of eligible securities or the company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the company and each holder of eligible securities agree that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this agreement (including section 10.9) and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 10.2. no inconsistent agreements . the company neither has, nor shall, on or after the closing date, enter into any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of eligible securities in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. except as set forth on schedule 10.2 , the company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its equity securities to any person. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the written consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding eligible securities, the company shall not grant to any person the right to request the company to register any equity securities of the company under the securities act unless the rights so granted are subject in all respects to the prior rights of the holders of eligible securities set forth herein, and are not otherwise in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement. 10.3. piggyback on registrations . subject to the limitations imposed by sections 3.1(b) and 3.2, the company shall have the right to include any securities of the company and of its securityholders who have participatory registration rights in any registration effected under sections 3.1 or 3.2. 10.4. adjustments affecting the eligible securities . the company will not take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to the eligible securities which would (i) adversely affect the ability of any of the holders of eligible securities to include such eligible securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this agreement or (ii) adversely affect the marketability of the eligible securities in any such registration. 10.5. amendments and waivers . the provisions of this agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the company has obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding eligible securities; provided , however , that, for the purposes of this agreement, eligible securities that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the company or an affiliate of the company are not deemed outstanding. notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of holders of eligible securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a registration statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other holders of eligible securities may be given by holders of a majority of outstanding eligible securities being sold by such holders pursuant to such registration statement; provided , however , that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. the parties hereto agree to amend this agreement as necessary to provide the parties with substantially similar (and in any event, no less favorable) rights in the event of the
