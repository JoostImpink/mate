provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.10(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person or any such underwriter or holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection 1.10(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.10(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection 1.10(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 10 page 52 of 92 pages (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.10 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.10, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.10, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.10. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.10 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all registrable securities offered and sold by such holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(b) the holders of a majority of the outstanding series 1 preferred stock shall be entitled to elect one (1) class iii director of the corporation at each election of such directors. 6. conversion rights. the holders of the series 1 ------------------- preferred stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the "conversion rights"): (a) right to convert. each share of series 1 preferred ---------------- stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the series 1 purchase date and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding any purchase by the corporation of such share of series 1 preferred stock pursuant to section 4, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the series 1 original issue price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon by the series 1 conversion price applicable to such share (determined as hereafter provided) in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. the initial series 1 conversion price per share for shares of series 1 preferred stock shall be the series 1 original issue price. the series 1 conversion price for the series 1 preferred stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in section 6(d). 8 page 84 of 92 pages (b) automatic conversion. each share of series 1 --------------------- preferred stock shall automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the series 1 original issue price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon by the series 1 conversion price at the time in effect immediately upon the earlier of (i) the date, which shall be no sooner than one year from the date the series 1 preferred stock is first issued, on which the last sale price of the common stock traded through the nasdaq national market has been at least five times the series 1 conversion price in effect on such date for thirty (30) consecutive trading days, with a minimum average trading volume per day of two percent (2%) of the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock not held by affiliates of the corporation or (ii) the date immediately prior to the closing of any merger, consolidation, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets pursuant to which the then outstanding common stock is converted into or exchanged for cash and/or fully-registered marketable securities at a price per share at least equal to five times the series 1 conversion price (as defined in section 6 hereof) in effect immediately preceding such transaction. (c) mechanics of conversion. before any holder of ------------------------- series 1 preferred stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of common stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for the series 1 preferred stock, and shall give written notice by mail, postage prepaid, to the corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock are to be issued. the corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of series 1 preferred stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of series 1 preferred stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock as of such date. (d) adjustments to series 1 conversion price for -------------------------------------------------- certain dilutive issues; splits and combinations. the series 1 conversion price - ------------------------------------------------ shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (i) stock issuances. --------------- (a) if the corporation shall issue, after the series 1 purchase date, any series 1 additional stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than $1.70 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or other recapitalizations of the series 1 preferred stock) or the fair market value per share of such series 1 additional stock (as determined in accordance with section 3(c)) (the "fair market price") in effect immediately prior to the ------------------- issuance of such series 1 additional stock, then, and in each such case, the series 1 conversion price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith be adjusted as follows: 9 page 85 of 92 pages (1) if the issuance is for less than $1.70 per share, then the series 1 conversion price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such series 1 conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to sections 6(d)(i)(e)(1) or 6(d)(i)(e)(2)) plus (b) the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation for such issuance would purchase at 56.67% of the series 1 conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance (determined in accordance with section 6(d)(i)(e)); and the denominator of which shall be equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to sections 6(d)(i)(e)(1) or 6(d)(i)(e)(2)) plus (y) the number of shares of such series 1 additional stock. (2) if the issuance is for less than the fair market price immediately prior to such issuance, then such series 1 conversion price shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this section 6(d)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such series 1 conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to sections 6(d)(i)(e)(1) or 6(d)(i)(e)(2)) plus the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received by this corporation (determined in accordance with section 6(d)(i)(e)) for such issuance would purchase at the fair market price immediately prior to such issuance; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (including shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to sections 6(d)(i)(e)(1) or 6(d)(i)(e)(2)) plus the number of shares of such series 1 additional stock. (3) if the issuance is for less than $1.70 per share and the fair market price immediately prior to such issuance, then the adjustment paragraph resulting in the lower series 1 conversion price shall control. (b) no adjustment of the series 1 conversion price shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. except to the limited extent provided for in sections 6(d)(i)(e)(4) and 6(d)(i)(e)(5), no adjustment of such series 1 conversion price pursuant to this section 6(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the series 1 conversion price above the series 1 conversion price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 10 page 86 of 92 pages (c) in the case of the issuance of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the corporation in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. (d) in the case of the issuance of the common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as mutually determined by the board of directors and the holders of the majority of the shares of the series 1 preferred stock then outstanding or, if the board of directors and the holders of the majority of the shares of series 1 preferred stock then outstanding shall fail to agree, at the corporation's expense by an appraiser chosen by the board of directors of the corporation and reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of series 1 preferred stock then outstanding. (e) in the case of the issuance (whether before, on or after the series 1 purchase date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for common stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities (collectively, "other securities"), the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this section 6(d)(i) and section 6(d)(ii): (1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in sections 6(d)(i)(c) and 6(d)(i)(d)), if any, received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for the common stock covered thereby. (2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of, or in exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for, any such convertible or exchangeable or exercisable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable or exercisable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange or exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in sections 6(d)(i)(c) and 6(d)(i)(d)). 11 page 87 of 92 pages (3) in the event of any change in the number of shares of common stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the corporation upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable or exercisable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the series 1 conversion price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of common stock or any payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities. (4) upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert, exchange or exercise or the expiration of any options or rights related to such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities, the series 1 conversion price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities. (5) the number of shares of common stock deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to sections 6(d)(i)(e)(1) and 6(d)(i)(e)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in either section 6(d)(ii)(e)(3) or 6(d)(i)(e)(4). (ii) "series 1 additional stock" shall mean any --------------------------- shares of common stock or other securities issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 6(d)(i)(e)) by this corporation after the series 1 purchase date other than: (a) shares of common stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in section 6(d)(iii) hereof; (b) shares of common stock or other securities issuable or issued to employees, consultants or directors of this corporation pursuant to a stock option plan or stock purchase plan approved by the board of directors of the corporation on or prior to the series 1 purchase date; 12 page 88 of 92 pages (c) shares of common stock issued to baylor college of medicine or assignees in connection with the sale of software licenses by the corporation in the houston, texas market through december 31, 2002; (d) shares of common stock or other securities issuable or issued in consideration for services rendered to the corporation or its subsidiaries (other than shares issuable or issued pursuant to section 6(d)(ii)(b)), in an aggregate amount not to exceed 200,000 shares per annum; (e) shares of common stock or other securities issuable or issued in connection with acquisitions, business combinations or strategic alliances, including corporate partnering agreements, in each case not to exceed 500,000 shares in the aggregate; (f) shares of common stock or other securities the issuance of which has been approved in writing by the holders of at least the majority of the then outstanding shares of series 1 preferred stock; (g) shares of common stock issuable upon (i) the conversion of the series 1 preferred stock, (ii) the exercise of the warrants, dated the series 1 purchase date, issued to holders of series 1 preferred stock, (iii) the exercise of the warrant, dated february 15, 2000, issued to lazard frere & co. llc, not to exceed 32,300 shares in the aggregate (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits or combinations or other recapitalizations); (iv) the exercise of the warrants, dated september 3, 1999, issued to america online, inc., not to exceed 727,911 shares in the aggregate (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits or combinations or other recapitalizations) or (v) the exercise of the warrant, dated september 14, 1999, issued to stoel rives llp, not to exceed 10,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations or other recapitalizations); or (h) shares of common stock issued pursuant to sections 2.3 and 2.4 of the stock purchase agreement, dated april 17, 2000, between the corporation and the founders of anywheremd.com, inc.
