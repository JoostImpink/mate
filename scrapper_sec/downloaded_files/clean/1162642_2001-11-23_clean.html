--- -- item 1. security and yonkers the securities to which this schedule 13d relate are the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "shares"), of yonkers financial corporation ("yonkers"), a delaware corporation, having its principal executive offices at 6 executive plaza, yonkers, new york 10701. item 2. identity and background this schedule 13d is being filed by atlantic bank of new york, a new york state chartered commercial bank ("atlantic"). the principal business office of atlantic is located at 960 avenue of the americas, new york, new york 10001. the names of the directors and executive officers of atlantic and their respective business addresses, citizenship and present principal occupations or employment, as well as the names, principal businesses and addresses of any corporations or other organizations in which such employment is conducted, are set forth on schedule i hereto, which schedule is incorporated herein by reference. during the last five years, neither atlantic nor, to the best of its knowledge, any of the persons listed in schedule i hereto have been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or were a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction which resulted in his or her being subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration as more fully described in item 4, yonkers has granted to atlantic an option pursuant to which atlantic has the right, upon the occurrence of certain events (none of which has occurred), to purchase up to 443,519 of the shares (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) at a price of $24.45 per share (the "option"). certain terms of the option are summarized in item 4. if the option were exercisable and atlantic were to exercise the option on the date hereof, the funds required to purchase the shares issuable upon such exercise would be approximately $10,844,040. it is currently anticipated that such funds would be derived from working capital. item 4. purpose of transaction atlantic is seeking to acquire the entire equity interest in yonkers pursuant to the merger (as defined below). the transactions reported hereunder are intended to assist in the achievement of that purpose. the merger agreement. atlantic and yonkers have entered into an agreement and merger agreement of merger, dated as of november 13, 2001 (the "merger schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 5 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- agreement"), providing for, among other things, the acquisition of yonkers by atlantic, including the merger of yonkers' wholly owned subsidiary, yonkers savings & loan association, f.a., into atlantic (the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement being hereinafter referred to as the "merger"). at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each outstanding share shall be converted into the right to receive $29.00 in cash without interest. consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including approval of the shareholders of yonkers and approval of appropriate regulatory agencies. the option agreement. concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, atlantic and yonkers entered into a stock option agreement, dated as of november 13, 2001 (the "option agreement"). the option agreement is designed to enhance the likelihood that the merger will be successfully consummated in accordance with the terms contemplated by the merger agreement and to provide some measure of compensation to atlantic for loss of benefits expected from the merger and/or loss of the opportunity to explore other transactions while the merger is pending, in the event that a purchase event (as defined below) occurs. pursuant to the option agreement, yonkers granted atlantic the option, which provides for the purchase of authorized but unissued shares (the "option shares") of up to 19.9% of the then outstanding shares at a price of $24.45 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. subject to applicable law and regulatory restrictions, atlantic may exercise the option, in whole or in part, if, but only if, a purchase event (as defined below) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an exercise termination event (as defined below). as defined in the option agreement, "purchase event" means any of the following events: (i) without atlantic's prior written consent, yonkers shall have authorized, recommended, publicly proposed or publicly announced an intention to authorize, recommend or propose, or yonkers shall have entered into an agreement with any person (other than atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic) to effect (a) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving yonkers or any of its significant subsidiaries, (b) the disposition, by sale, lease, exchange or otherwise, of assets or deposits of yonkers or any of its significant subsidiaries representing in either case 25% or more of the consolidated assets or deposits of yonkers and its subsidiaries or (c) the issuance, sale or other disposition by yonkers of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 25% or more of the voting power of yonkers or any of its significant subsidiaries (each of (a), (b) or (c), an "acquisition transaction"); provided, however, that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only yonkers and one or more of its subsidiaries, or involving only any two or more of such subsidiaries be deemed to be an acquisition transaction, provided that any such transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the merger agreement; or schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 6 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- (ii) any person (other than atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic) shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) of, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act), other than a group of which atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic is a member, shall have been formed which beneficially owns, or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 25% or more of the voting power of yonkers or any of its significant subsidiaries. "exercise termination event" means the earliest to occur of (a) the effective time, (b) termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the terms thereof prior to the occurrence of a purchase event or a preliminary purchase event other than a termination thereof by atlantic pursuant to section 6.01(b)(ii) of the merger agreement (a termination of the merger agreement by atlantic pursuant to such section of the merger agreement, being referred to herein as a "default termination"), (c) 15 months after a default termination, or (d) 15 months after termination of the merger agreement (other than a default termination) following the occurrence of a purchase event or a preliminary purchase event. "preliminary purchase event" means any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date of the option agreement: (i) any person (other than atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic) shall have commenced (as such term is defined in rule 14d-2, promulgated under the exchange act) or shall have filed a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any shares such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would own or control 20% or more of the then outstanding shares (such an offer being referred to herein as a "tender offer" or an "exchange offer," respectively); or (ii) the stockholders of yonkers shall not have approved the merger agreement by the requisite vote at the meeting of the stockholders of yonkers called for that purpose ("yonkers meeting"), the yonkers meeting shall not have been held or shall have been canceled prior to termination of the merger agreement, or yonkers' board of directors shall have publicly withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to atlantic the recommendation of yonkers' board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, in each case after it shall have been publicly announced that any person (other than atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic) shall have (a) made, or disclosed an intention to make, a bona fide proposal to engage in an acquisition transaction, (b) commenced a tender offer or filed a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an exchange offer or (c) filed an application (or given a notice), whether in draft or final form, under the home owners' loan act of 1933, as amended, the bank holding company act, as amended, the bank merger act, as amended, or the change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, for approval to engage in an acquisition transaction; or (iii) any person (other than atlantic or any subsidiary of atlantic) shall have made a bona fide proposal to yonkers or its stockholders by public announcement, or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure, to engage in an acquisition transaction; or schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 7 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- (iv) after a proposal is made by a third party to yonkers or its stockholders to engage in an acquisition transaction, or such third party states its intention to yonkers to make such a proposal if the merger agreement terminates, yonkers shall breach any covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement and such breach would entitle atlantic to terminate the merger agreement under section 6.01(b)(ii) thereof (without regard to the cure period provided for therein unless such cure is promptly effected without jeopardizing consummation of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement). as provided in the option agreement, in the event atlantic wishes to exercise the option, it shall send to yonkers a written notice (the "option exercise notice," the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of option shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 15 business days from the notice date for the closing (the "closing") of such purchase (such date as it may be extended pursuant to the next sentence, the "closing date"). if prior notification to or approval of any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over insured depositary institutions or their holding companies, the securities and exchange commission, the nasd or any other self-regulatory organization (each, a "regulatory authority") is required in connection with any such purchase, yonkers shall cooperate with holder in the filing of the required notice or application for approval and the obtaining of such approval, and, in the event that such regulatory approvals must be obtained or mandatory waiting periods must expire prior to closing, the closing shall occur promptly following receipt of any such required regulatory approvals and the expiration of any such mandatory waiting periods. any exercise of the option shall be deemed to occur on the notice date relating thereto. under applicable law and in connection with the option agreement, atlantic may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board, the new york state banking department, the federal deposit insurance corporation or other governmental authority prior to acquiring 5% or more of the shares. neither the option agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder or under the option shall be assigned by any of the parties thereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, except that atlantic may assign the option agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of atlantic and atlantic may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in part after the occurrence of a purchase event. subject to the preceding sentence, the option agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. the option may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part, by atlantic except after the occurrence of a purchase event, and then only as follows. if atlantic shall determine to accept a bona fide offer to purchase any portion of the option then held by it or to sell any such portion of the option, atlantic shall give written notice thereof to yonkers specifying (i) the portion of the option to be sold and (ii) the purchase price therefor and any other significant terms of the proposed transaction. upon receipt of such notice, yonkers shall, for a period of five business days immediately following such receipt, have the schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 8 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- right of first refusal to cancel the portion of the option then held by atlantic that is proposed to be sold upon the payment of a cancellation fee equal to the purchase price set forth in such notice. payment for such portion of the option to be cancelled shall be made to atlantic in immediately available funds within five business days immediately following receipt of the notice of the proposed sale. in addition, any shares purchased under the exercise of the option may be resold by atlantic pursuant to registration rights under the option agreement. in the event of any change in yonkers common stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, split-up, recapitalization, combination, conversion, subdivision, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, and the purchase price (as defined in the option agreement) therefore, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreement or instrument governing any such transaction so that holder shall receive, upon exercise of the option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that holder would have received in respect of yonkers common stock if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefore, as applicable. if any additional shares of yonkers common stock are issued after the date of this agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in the first sentence of this section 7(a), upon exercise of any option to purchase yonkers common stock outstanding on the date hereof or upon conversion into yonkers common stock of any convertible security of yonkers outstanding on the date hereof), the number of shares of yonkers common stock subject to the option shall be adjusted so that, after such issuance, exercise or conversion, the option, together with any shares of yonkers common stock previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 19.9% of the number of shares of yonkers common stock then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the option. no provision of this section 7 shall be deemed to affect or change, or constitute authorization for any violation of, any of the covenants or representations in the option agreement. except as otherwise provided in the option agreement, at the request of atlantic at any time commencing upon the first occurrence of a repurchase event (as defined in section 8(d) of the option agreement) and ending 12 months immediately thereafter, yonkers shall repurchase from atlantic (i) the option and (ii) all shares purchased by atlantic pursuant to the option agreement with respect to which atlantic then has beneficial ownership. the date on which atlantic exercises its rights under section 8 of the option agreement is referred to as the "section 8 request date." such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "section 8 repurchase consideration") equal to the sum of: (i) the aggregate purchase price paid by atlantic for any shares acquired pursuant to the option with respect to which atlantic then has beneficial ownership; (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the applicable price (as defined below) for each share over (b) the purchase price therefore (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7 of the option agreement), multiplied by the number of shares with respect to which the option has not been exercised; and schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 9 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- (iii) the excess, if any, of the applicable price over the purchase price therefore (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7 of the option agreement) paid (or, in the case of option shares with respect to which the option has been exercised but the closing date has not occurred, payable) by atlantic for each share with respect to which the option has been exercised and with respect to which atlantic then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is or becomes required for any reason in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration, atlantic shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to section 8 of the option agreement, in whole or in part, or to require that yonkers deliver from time to time that portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval). if any regulatory authority disapproves of any part of yonkers' proposed repurchase pursuant to section 8 of the option agreement, yonkers shall promptly give notice of such fact to atlantic, and atlantic shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such regulatory authority, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the option and/or option shares and to what extent to each, and atlantic shall thereupon have the right to exercise the option as to the number of option shares for which the option was exercisable at the section 8 request date less the number of shares covered by the option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to section 8(a)(ii) of the option agreement. atlantic shall notify yonkers of its determination under the preceding sentence within five business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase. notwithstanding anything therein to the contrary, in the event that yonkers delivers to atlantic written notice accompanied by a certification of yonkers' independent auditor each stating that a requested repurchase of the option or shares would result in the recapture of yonkers' bad debt reserves under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, atlantic's repurchase request shall be deemed to be automatically revoked. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all of holder's rights under this section 8 shall terminate on the date of termination of this option pursuant to section 3(a) of the option agreement. for purposes of the option agreement, the "applicable price" means the highest of (i) the highest price per share paid for any such share by the person or groups described in section 8(d)(i) of the option agreement, (ii) the price per share received by holders of the shares in connection with any merger, sale or other business combination transaction described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) of the option agreement, or (iii) the highest closing sales price per share quoted on the nasdaq stock market ("nasdaq") (or if the shares are not quoted on nasdaq, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by atlantic) during the 40 business days preceding the section 8 request date; provided, however, that in the event of a sale of less than all of yonkers' assets, the applicable price shall be the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 10 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- yonkers as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by atlantic, divided by the number of shares outstanding at the time of such sale; provided further, that in no event shall the applicable price be greater than the market price (as defined in, and determined at the time specified in, article tenth, section b of yonkers' certificate of incorporation). if the consideration to be offered, paid or received pursuant to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be other than in cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by atlantic and reasonably acceptable to yonkers, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes of the option agreement. as used in the option agreement, "repurchase event" shall occur if (i) any person (other than yonkers or any subsidiary of yonkers) shall have acquired beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the exchange act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares, or (ii) any of the transactions described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) of the option agreement shall be consummated. in the event that yonkers shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than atlantic or one of its subsidiaries, and yonkers shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than atlantic or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into yonkers and yonkers shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of yonkers or any other person or cash or any other property, or the outstanding shares immediately prior to such merger shall, after such merger, represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any person, other than atlantic or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of atlantic, to purchase shares of either (a) the acquiring corporation (as defined in the option agreement), (b) any person that controls the acquiring corporation or (c) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), yonkers. as more fully described in the option agreement, the substitute option shall have substantially the same terms as the option, including the ability to be repurchased, with adjustments in the exercise price as set forth in the option agreement. notwithstanding any other provisions in the option agreement, in no event shall atlantic's total profit (as defined in the option agreement) exceed $4.0 million, and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, atlantic, at its sole election, shall either (i) deliver to yonkers for cancellation option shares previously purchased by atlantic, (ii) pay cash or other consideration to yonkers or (iii) undertake any combination thereof, so that atlantic's total profit shall not exceed $4.0 million after taking into account the foregoing actions. schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 11 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in the event that atlantic receives a total profit of $4.0 million, atlantic shall deliver (x) to yonkers for cancellation all option shares previously purchased by atlantic and yonkers shall pay atlantic the exercise price paid by atlantic for such option shares, and (y) deliver for cancellation the option or any remaining portion thereof. notwithstanding any other provision of the option agreement, the option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the notice date, result in a notional total profit (as defined in the option agreement) of more than $4.0 million, and, if exercise of the option otherwise would exceed such amount, atlantic, at its discretion, may increase the purchase price for that number of shares set forth in the option exercise notice so that the notional total profit shall not exceed $4.0 million; provided, that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the option permitted hereby on any subsequent date at the purchase price set forth in section 2 of the option agreement. other than as indicated above, and as set forth in the option agreement and the merger agreement, atlantic does not have any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of yonkers, or the disposition of securities of yonkers; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving yonkers or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of yonkers or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of yonkers, including any plans or proposals to change the number or terms of directors or to fill any vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of yonkers; (f) any other material change in yonkers' business or corporate structure; (g) any change in yonkers' organization certificate, bylaws, or other instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of yonkers by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of yonkers to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of yonkers becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended; or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. copies of the option agreement and the merger agreement are filed as exhibits to this schedule 13d and are incorporated herein by reference. the foregoing summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits. item 5. interest in securities of yonkers (a) (i) atlantic is the beneficial owner of 0 shares; (ii) the option. atlantic also may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the option shares. as provided in the option agreement, atlantic may exercise the option only upon the happening of one or more events, none of which has occurred. see item 4 hereof. since the option is not presently exercisable, atlantic expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any of the option shares. if the option were exercised in full, the option shares would represent approximately 16.6% of the currently outstanding shares (after giving effect to schedule 13d cusip no. 986 073 104 page 12 of 21 pages ----------- --- -- the issuance of such option shares). atlantic has no right to vote or dispose of the shares subject to the option unless and until such time as the option is exercised. to the best knowledge of atlantic, none of the persons listed on schedule i hereto beneficially owns any shares. (b) (i) atlantic has sole or shared voting or dispositive power over 0 shares; (ii) the option. if atlantic were to exercise the option, it would have sole power to vote and, subject to the terms of the option agreement, sole power to direct the disposition of the shares covered thereby. (c) the option. atlantic acquired the option in connection with the execution of the merger agreement. see item 4 hereof. to the best knowledge of atlantic, none of the persons listed on schedule i hereto has effected any transactions in the shares during the past 60 days. (d) no person other than atlantic has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, any shares that may be deemed beneficially owned by atlantic.

provided, however, that no such payment shall be made to such holder unless and until such holder has agreed to -4- such payment and has executed and delivered to seller an instrument in such form prescribed by purchaser and reasonably satisfactory to seller accepting such payment in full settlement of his or her rights relative to seller option. prior to the date hereof (in the case of the individuals listed in section 1.06 of seller disclosure schedule) and within thirty (30) days thereafter (in the case of all others) seller shall obtain the written consent to the provisions of this section 1.06 on the form prescribed by the purchaser of each person who is the holder of options outstanding under the 1996 stock option and incentive plan (the "seller option plan") that will not, by their terms, expire prior to the effective time. article ii representations and warranties section 2.01 disclosure letter. on or prior to the date hereof, seller has delivered to purchaser a letter (its "disclosure letter") setting forth, among other things, facts, circumstances and events the disclosure of which is required or appropriate in relation to any or all of its covenants, representations and warranties (and making specific reference to the section of this agreement to which they relate), other than section 2.03(h);

(b) in the event that issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, and issuer shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of issuer common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of issuer or any other person or cash or any other property, or the outstanding shares of issuer common stock immediately prior to such merger shall, after such merger, represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of holder, -7- to purchase shares of either (a) the acquiring corporation (as hereinafter defined), (b) any person that controls the acquiring corporation or (c) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), issuer (such person being referred to as "substitute option issuer"). (c) the substitute option shall have the same terms as the option; provided, that, if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to holder. substitute option issuer shall also enter into an agreement with holder in substantially the same form as this agreement, which shall be applicable to the substitute option. (d) the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of substitute common stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the assigned value (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares of issuer common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable, divided by the average price (as hereinafter defined). the exercise price of the substitute option per share of substitute common stock (the "substitute option price") shall be equal to the purchase price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of issuer common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares of the substitute common stock for which the substitute option is exercisable. (e) the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) "acquiring corporation" shall mean (a) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with issuer (if other than issuer), (b) issuer in a merger in which issuer is the continuing or surviving person or (c) the transferee of all or substantially all of issuer's assets (or a substantial part of the assets of its subsidiaries taken as a whole).

(iii) "assigned value" shall mean the highest of (a) the price per share of issuer common stock at which a tender offer or an exchange offer therefor has been made, (b) the price per share of issuer common stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with issuer, (c) the highest closing price for shares of issuer common stock within the 60-day period immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question and (d) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of issuer's assets or deposits, an amount equal to (x) the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets (and/or deposits) and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer, as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder, divided by (y) the number of shares of issuer common stock outstanding at such time. in the event that a tender offer or an exchange offer is made for issuer common stock or an agreement is entered into for a merger or consolidation involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities -8- or other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for issuer common stock shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder. (iv) "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of substitute common stock for the one year period immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided, that, if issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by issuer, the person merging into issuer or by any company which controls such person, as holder may elect. (f) in no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the number of shares of substitute common stock for which the substitute option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of substitute common stock immediately prior to exercise of the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of substitute common stock but for the limitation in the first sentence of this section 7(f), substitute option issuer shall make a cash payment to holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this section 7(f) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this section 7(f). this difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder. (g) issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in section 7(b) of this agreement unless the acquiring corporation and any person that controls the acquiring corporation assume in writing all the obligations of issuer hereunder and take all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this section 7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action that may be necessary so that the holders of the other shares of common stock issued by substitute option issuer are not entitled to exercise any rights by reason of the issuance or exercise of the substitute option and the shares of substitute common stock do not have lesser economic value (other than any diminution in value resulting from the fact that the shares of substitute common stock may be restricted securities, as defined in rule 144, promulgated under the securities act ("rule 144"), or any successor provision) than other shares of common stock issued by substitute option issuer). 8. repurchase at the option of holder.

(b) if holder exercises its rights under this section 8, issuer shall, within 10 business days after the section 8 request date, pay the section 8 repurchase consideration to holder in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, holder shall surrender to issuer the option and the certificates evidencing the option shares purchased thereunder with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, and holder shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all liens. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is or becomes required for any reason in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration, holder shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to this section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval). if any regulatory authority disapproves of any part of issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this section 8, issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to holder, and holder shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such regulatory authority, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the option and/or option shares and to what extent to each, and holder shall thereupon have the right to exercise the option as to the number of option shares for which the option was exercisable at the section 8 request date less the number of shares covered by the option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to section 8(a)(ii) of this agreement. holder shall notify issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within five business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that issuer delivers to holder written notice accompanied by a certification of issuer's independent auditor each stating that a requested repurchase of issuer common stock would result in the recapture of issuer's bad debt reserves under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), holder's repurchase request shall be deemed to be automatically revoked. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all of holder's rights -10- under this section 8 shall terminate on the date of termination of this option pursuant to section 3(a) of this agreement. (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "applicable price" means the highest of (i) the highest price per share of issuer common stock paid for any such share by the person or groups described in section 8(d)(i) hereof, (ii) the price per share of issuer common stock received by holders of issuer common stock in connection with any merger, sale or other business combination transaction described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) of this agreement, or (iii) the highest closing sales price per share of issuer common stock quoted on the nasdaq stock market ("nasdaq") (or if issuer common stock is not quoted on nasdaq, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by holder) during the 40 business days preceding the section 8 request date; provided, however that in the event of a sale of less than all of issuer's assets, the applicable price shall be the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder, divided by the number of shares of the issuer common stock outstanding at the time of such sale; provided further, that in no event shall the applicable price be greater than the market price (as defined in, and determined at the time specified in, article tenth, section b of issuer's certificate of incorporation). if the consideration to be offered, paid or received pursuant to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be other than in cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes of this agreement. (d) as used herein, "repurchase event" shall occur if (i) any person (other than grantee or any subsidiary of grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the exchange act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of issuer common stock, or (ii) any of the transactions described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) of this agreement shall be consummated. 9. repurchase of substitute option. (a) subject to the last sentence of section 3(a) of this agreement, at the request of holder at any time commencing upon the first occurrence of a repurchase event (as defined in section 8(d) hereof) and ending 12 months immediately thereafter, substitute option issuer (or any successor entity thereof) shall repurchase from holder (i) the substitute option and (ii) all shares of substitute common stock purchased by holder pursuant hereto with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership. the date on which holder exercises its rights under this section 9 is referred to as the "section 9 request date." such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "section 9 repurchase consideration") equal to the sum of: -11- (i) the aggregate purchase price paid by holder for any shares of substitute common stock acquired pursuant to the substitute option with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership; (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the highest closing price (as defined below) for each share of substitute common stock over (b) the purchase price (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7 of this agreement), multiplied by the number of shares of substitute common stock with respect to which the substitute option has not been exercised; and (iii) the excess, if any, of the highest closing price over the purchase price (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7 of this agreement) paid (or, in the case of substitute option shares with respect to which the substitute option has been exercised but the closing date has not occurred, payable) by holder for each share of substitute common stock with respect to which the substitute option has been exercised and with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares. (b) if holder exercises its rights under this section 9, substitute option issuer shall, within 10 business days after the section 9 request date, pay the section 9 repurchase consideration to holder in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, holder shall surrender to substitute option issuer the substitute option and the certificates evidencing the shares of substitute common stock purchased thereunder with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, and holder shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all liens. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the section 9 repurchase consideration, holder shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to this section 9, in whole or in part, or to require that substitute option issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the section 9 repurchase consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval). if any regulatory authority disapproves of any part of substitute option issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this section 9, substitute option issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to holder, and holder shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such regulatory authority, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the substitute option and/or substitute option shares and to what extent to each, and holder shall thereupon have the right to exercise the substitute option as to the number of substitute option shares for which the substitute option was exercisable at the section 9 request date less the number of shares covered by the substitute option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to section 9(a)(ii) of this agreement. holder shall notify substitute option issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within five business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that substitute option issuer delivers to holder written notice accompanied by a certification of substitute option issuer's independent auditor each stating that a requested repurchase of issuer common stock would result in the recapture of substitute option issuer's bad debt reserves under the code, holder's repurchase request shall be deemed to be automatically revoked. -12- notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all of holder's rights under this section 9 shall terminate on the date of termination of this substitute option pursuant to section 3(a) of this agreement. (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "highest closing price" means the highest of closing sales price for shares of substitute common stock quoted on nasdaq (or if the substitute common stock is not quoted on nasdaq, on the principal trading market on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source) during the six-month period preceding the section 9 request date. 10. registration rights. (a) demand registration right. issuer shall, subject to the conditions of section 10(c) of this agreement, if requested by any holder, including grantee and any permitted transferee ("selling shareholder"), promptly prepare and file a registration statement under applicable laws and regulations, if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of issuer common stock or other securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the selling shareholder upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the selling shareholder in such request, including without limitation a "shelf" registration statement under applicable laws and regulations, and issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares or other securities for sale under any applicable state securities laws. (b) additional registration rights. if issuer, at any time after the exercise of the option, proposes to register any shares of issuer common stock under applicable laws and regulations in connection with an underwritten public offering of such issuer common stock, issuer will promptly give written notice to the selling shareholders of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any selling shareholder given within 30 days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of issuer common stock intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by the selling shareholder), issuer will cause all such shares for which a selling shareholder requests participation in such registration, to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if the underwriters in good faith object for valid business reasons, or (ii) in the case of a registration solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on form s-4 of the securities act or any equivalent or successor form. if some, but not all the shares of issuer common stock, with respect to which issuer shall have received requests for registration pursuant to this section 10(b), shall be excluded from such registration, issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be registered among the selling shareholders desiring to register their shares pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be registered by each such selling shareholder bears to the total number of shares requested to be registered by all such selling shareholders then desiring to have issuer common stock registered for sale. (c) conditions to required registration. issuer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each registration statement referred to in section 10(a) of this agreement to become effective -13- and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective, provided, however, that issuer may delay any registration of option shares required pursuant to section 10(a) of this agreement for a period not exceeding 90 days provided issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would adversely affect an offering or contemplated offering of other securities by issuer, and issuer shall not be required to register option shares under the securities act pursuant to section 10(a) hereof: (i) prior to a purchase event; (ii) on more than three occasions; (iii) within 180 days after the effective date of a registration referred to in section 10(b) of this agreement pursuant to which the selling shareholder or selling shareholders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register such shares under the securities act and such shares were registered as requested; and (iv) unless a request therefor is made to issuer by selling shareholders that hold at least 25% or more of the aggregate number of option shares (including shares of issuer common stock issuable upon exercise of the option) then outstanding. in addition to the foregoing, issuer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement after the expiration of nine months from the effective date of such registration statement. issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of the option shares so registered in accordance with the intended method of distribution for such shares; provided, however, that issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. (d) expenses. except where applicable state law prohibits such payments, issuer shall pay all expenses (including, without limitation, registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel), legal expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose option shares are being registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions directly relating to the sale of the option shares, but including liability insurance if issuer so desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to section 10(a) or 10(b) of this agreement (including the related offerings and sales by holders of option shares) and all other qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to section 10(a) or 10(b) of this agreement. (e) indemnification. in connection with any registration under section 10(a) or 10(b) of this agreement, issuer hereby indemnifies the selling shareholders, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any -14- untrue, or alleged untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or notification or offering circular, or caused by any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and issuer and each officer, director and controlling person of issuer shall be indemnified by such selling shareholders, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement, that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such holder or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use. promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this section 10(e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this section 10(e), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this section 10(e). in case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees and expenses of such counsel. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnification provided for in this section 10(e) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by issuer, the selling shareholders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of issuer, the selling shareholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, -15- claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall any selling shareholder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its option shares included in the offering. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. any obligation by any holder to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other holders. in connection with any registration pursuant to section 10(a) or 10(b) of this agreement, issuer and each selling shareholder (other than grantee) shall enter into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of section 10(e) of this agreement.
