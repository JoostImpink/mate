(a)-(c) and parent, the company and purchaser have entered into the merger (j) agreement, pursuant to which purchaser will offer to purchase the shares, at the per share amount net to the seller in cash, less any required withholding of taxes (the "offer"). the merger agreement provides that purchaser will be merged with and into the company (the "merger") as soon as practicable following the purchase by purchaser of 90% or more of the issued and outstanding shares in the offer or any requisite stockholder meeting. following the merger, the company will continue as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") and a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of parent, and the separate corporate existence of purchaser will cease. pursuant to the merger agreement, each share, together with any associated rights, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the "effective time") (other than shares held by any of the company's subsidiaries and shares held by parent, purchaser or any other subsidiary of parent), will be converted into and shall become the right to receive the per share amount in cash, without interest. the foregoing summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the merger agreement. the purpose of the offer is to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. the purpose of the merger is to acquire all outstanding shares 5 6 schedule 13d - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cusip no. 74264q 10 8 page 6 of 20 pages - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- not tendered and purchased pursuant to the offer. if the offer is successful, purchaser intends to consummate the merger as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement. except as described in the merger agreement and in this item 4, neither parent nor purchaser has any present plans or proposals that would relate to or result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company or the disposition of securities of the company; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the board of directors of the company (the "company board") or management of the company; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (vi) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (vii) changes in the charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions that might impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; or (ix) a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "act"). (d) the merger agreement provides that promptly after the tender offer purchase time, and from time to time thereafter, purchaser shall be entitled to designate that number (but no more than that number) of directors of the company constituting a majority of the company board, and the company shall use its best efforts to, upon request by purchaser, promptly, at the company's election, either increase the size of the company board (subject to the provisions of article fifth of the company's certificate of incorporation) or secure the resignation of such number of directors as is necessary to enable purchaser's designees to be elected to the company board and to cause purchaser's designees to be so elected and to constitute at all times after the tender offer purchase time a majority of the company board. at such times, the company will use its best efforts to cause persons designated by purchaser to constitute the same percentage as is on the company board of (i) each committee of the company board (other than any committee of the company board established to take action under this agreement), (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary of the company and (iii) each committee of each such board. notwithstanding the foregoing, until the effective time, the company shall retain at least three directors who are directors of the company on the date of the merger agreement and parent and purchaser will not, and will cause their affiliates not to, (a) initiate, propose, vote for or solicit others to vote for, any change in the number of directors of prism mortgage company, an illinois 6 7 schedule 13d - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cusip no. 74264q 10 8 page 7 of 20 pages - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, as of the date of the merger agreement or (b) take any action that would be reasonably likely to result in any change described in the foregoing clause (a). the company's obligation to appoint designees to the board is subject to section 14(f) of the act and rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. the directors of purchaser at the effective time will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation and will hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. the officers of the company at the effective time will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation and will hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(f) it is expected that, initially following the merger, the business operations of the company will be continued by the surviving corporation substantially as they are currently being conducted. upon completion of the offer and the merger, parent intends to conduct a detailed review of the company and its assets, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, policies, management and personnel. after such review, parent will determine what actions or changes, if any, would be desirable in light of the circumstances which then exist. (g) the certificate of incorporation of purchaser in effect at the effective time will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law. the bylaws of purchaser in effect at the effective time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law. (h) it is parent's current intention to cause the company to terminate the inclusion of the shares on the nasdaq national market following the tender offer purchase time and the record date of the stockholders' meeting. inclusion of the shares on the nasdaq national market is voluntary, so the company may terminate that inclusion at any time. in addition, depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares may no longer meet the standards for continued inclusion in the nasdaq national market.
