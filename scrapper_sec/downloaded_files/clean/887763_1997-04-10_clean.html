----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 043491 10 9 page 6 of 14 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- termination fee or post-termination fee to become payable to cascade by the issuer under the merger agreement. a trigger event will be deemed to have occurred and the ascend stock option will become exercisable under the following circumstances: (1) upon the termination of the merger agreement by cascade if (a)(i) the board of directors of the issuer shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse to cascade; (ii) an alternative transaction (as defined below) involving the issuer shall have taken place or the board of directors of the issuer shall have recommended such an alternative transaction (or a proposal or offer therefor) to the stockholders of the issuer or shall have publicly announced its intention to recommend such an alternative transaction (or a proposal or offer therefor) or to engage in an alternative transaction; or (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer for twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of the common stock shall have been commenced or a registration statement with respect thereto shall have been filed (other than by cascade or an affiliate thereof) and the board of directors of the issuer shall have (x) recommended that the stockholders of the issuer tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or (y) publicly announced its intention to take no position with respect to such tender offer, and (b) at the time of the event giving rise to the right of cascade to terminate, an alternative transaction involving the issuer shall have been announced or proposed which shall not have been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned; or (2) upon the termination of the merger agreement by cascade if the issuer shall have willfully or intentionally breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the issuer set forth in the merger agreement, which breach, if uncured, would cause any of the conditions to the closing of the merger not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days following receipt by the issuer of written notice of such breach from cascade, and at the time of the event giving rise to the right of cascade to terminate, an alternative transaction involving the issuer shall have been announced or proposed which shall not have been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned; or (3) upon the termination of the merger agreement by the issuer as a result of the failure to receive the requisite vote for the approval of the issuance of issuer common stock in the merger by the stockholders of the issuer, and at the time of the event giving rise to the right of the issuer to terminate, an alternative transaction involving the issuer shall have been announced or proposed which shall not have been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned. (4) after termination of the merger agreement by cascade as a result of the failure to receive the requisite vote for the issuance of shares of issuer common stock pursuant to the merger agreement by the stockholders of the issuer, if cascade delivers written notice of such termination to the issuer within twenty (20) days after the applicable meeting of stockholders of the issuer, and, at the time of the event giving rise to the right of cascade to terminate the merger agreement, an alternative transaction involving the issuer shall have been announced or proposed which shall not have been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned, and the issuer within one hundred eighty (180) days after such termination enters into a definitive written merger or other business combination agreement with the offeror in such alternative transaction (or any affiliate thereof) or recommends that the stockholders of the issuer tender their shares of the issuer's capital stock in response to a tender or exchange offer providing for an alternative transaction by such offeror (or any affiliate thereof) . an "alternative transaction" involving the issuer means (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person or group (as such term is defined under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended), other than cascade, or any affiliate thereof (a "third party"), - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 043491 10 9 page 7 of 14 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- acquires (or would acquire upon completion of such transaction or series of transactions) more than twenty percent (20%) of the equity securities or voting power of the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries, pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries pursuant to which any third party acquires ownership (or would acquire ownership upon consummation of such merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination) of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding equity securities or voting power of the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries or of the entity surviving such merger or business combination or resulting from such consolidation, (iii) any other transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any third party acquires (or would acquire upon completion of such transaction or series of transactions) control of assets of the issuer or any of its material subsidiaries (including, for this purpose, outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of such party) having a fair market value equal to more than twenty percent (20%) of the fair market value of all the consolidated assets of the issuer immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions, or (iv) any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any third party acquires (or would acquire upon completion of such transaction or series of transactions) control of the board of directors of the issuer or by which nominees of any third party are (or would be) elected or appointed to a majority of the seats on the board of directors of the issuer. with certain exceptions, the ascend stock option terminates upon the occurrence of the earlier of the following: (i) the effective time of the merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement under circumstances which do not constitute a trigger event, and (iii) 270 days after the issuer receives written notice of the occurrence of a trigger event. notwithstanding the foregoing, the ascend stock option will remain exercisable for a period of 180 days after the date on which it becomes exercisable after a termination of the merger agreement by cascade as described in the paragraph (4) of this item 4. in addition, the ascend stock option exercise period is automatically extended if exercise of the ascend stock option is prohibited or restrained for certain legal reasons. the ascend stock option may not be exercised if cascade is in material breach of its material representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the ascend stock option agreement or the merger agreement. at any time when the ascend stock option is exercisable, cascade has the right to "put" the ascend stock option back to the issuer. under these "put" provisions, cascade has the right to require the issuer to repurchase the ascend stock option, either in whole or in part. in addition, cascade has certain rights under the ascend stock option agreement to "put" any or all shares purchased under the ascend stock option back to the issuer. under these stock "put" provisions, cascade has the right to require the issuer to repurchase any or all shares purchased by cascade under the ascend stock option. at the issuer's discretion, or as specified by cascade, all or part of the share repurchase price will be paid by redelivery of the shares of cascade previously issued to the issuer as payment of the purchase price under the ascend stock option. after any exercise of the ascend stock option by cascade, the issuer would have certain "first refusal" rights with respect to the shares of common stock acquired by cascade under the ascend stock option. under these "first refusal" rights, the issuer has the right to repurchase all (but not less than all) of common stock acquired by cascade under the ascend stock option. the aggregate amount payable by issuer under the ascend stock option agreement is capped, as are the aggregate net proceeds receivable by cascade from sales of shares received upon exercise of the ascend stock option. the maximum amount payable by the issuer to cascade under the merger agreement and the "put" provisions of the ascend stock option agreement may not exceed $85 million. in addition, if cascade would receive net proceeds of more than $85 million (over and above the aggregate - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 043491 10 9 page 8 of 14 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- exercise price) from third party sales or dispositions of the shares of common stock acquired under the ascend stock option, all net proceeds in excess of such amount will be remitted to the issuer. under the ascend stock option agreement, cascade's right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer shares of the issuer is subject to certain restrictions and first-refusal rights in favor of the issuer. in addition, the ascend stock option agreement gives cascade certain rights to have the shares acquired upon exercise of the ascend stock option be registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, for sale in a public offering. the registration rights take effect after the termination of the merger agreement and are subject to conditions and limitations. in lieu of registration, the ascend stock option agreement gives the issuer the option to agree to purchase, for cash, all or part of the securities covered by the registration request, at a price equal to the average last sale price of the common stock for the preceding ten trading days. the ascend stock option agreement allows cascade to demand two registrations, and allows the issuer to defer the requested registrations for certain periods in the following circumstances: (i) for up to 40 days when the issuer is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes is would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and which, in the opinion of counsel to the issuer, would be required to be disclosed in the registration statement, and (ii) for up to 90 days when required audited financial statements are not yet available or the issuer reasonably determines that registration would interfere with a material financing, acquisition or other transaction. the foregoing summary of the ascend stock option is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the ascend stock option agreement included as exhibit 2 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein in its entirety by --------- reference. if the merger is consummated pursuant to the merger agreement, the ascend stock option will not be exercised. as an inducement to the issuer to enter into the merger agreement, issuer and cascade have also entered into a cascade stock option agreement, which entitles the issuer to purchase up to 18,765,939 shares of cascade common stock under the circumstances specified in the cascade stock option agreement between cascade and the issuer. the foregoing summary of the cascade stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the cascade stock option agreement included as exhibit 1 to this schedule 13d and --------- incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. if the merger is consummated pursuant to the merger agreement, the cascade stock option will not be exercised. also as an inducement to issuer to enter into the merger agreement, the directors and executive officers (the "voting agreement stockholders") of cascade have entered into a cascade director and officer stock voting agreement (collectively the "cascade voting agreements") with issuer. pursuant to each voting agreement, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed to vote the shares of cascade common stock owned by them (i) in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger and (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to or competition with consummation of the merger. the voting agreement stockholders have also irrevocably appointed the issuer as their lawful attorney and proxy to vote the shares of cascade common stock owned by the voting agreement stockholders in the manner described in the previous sentence. the voting agreements each terminates upon the earlier to occur of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement. the foregoing summary of each of the cascade voting agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the form of cascade voting agreement included as exhibit 3 of this schedule 13d and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. inasmuch as the issuer's voting rights under the voting agreements are limited solely to certain matters related to the merger, and the issuer has no economic interest in or dispositive power over the shares of the issuer's common stock covered thereby, and such shares may be sold by the holders thereof, the - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 043491 10 9 page 9 of 14 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- issuer expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock of the issuer covered by the cascade voting agreements. as an inducement to cascade to enter into the merger agreement, all of the directors and executive officers of the issuer have entered into an ascend director and officer stock voting agreement dated as of march 30, 1997 with the issuer, the substance of which is substantially similar to the substance of the cascade voting agreements. a copy of the form of ascend director and officer stock voting agreement is included as exhibit 4 of this schedule 13d and incorporated herein in its entirety by - --------- reference. also in connection with the merger agreement, the voting agreement stockholders and the directors and executive officers of cascade have each entered into a director, officer and stockholder agreement with ascend (collectively, the "agreements") pursuant to which each person has agreed not to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, dispose or otherwise reduce its risk relative to any shares of issuer common stock or other equity securities of issuer (and cascade common stock with respect to its directors and executive officers) owned by it during the period beginning on the date 30 days prior to the closing date (as defined in the merger agreement) and ending on the day after ascend has published financial results covering at least 30 days of combined operations of ascend and cascade in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission ("commission"), a report to the commission on form 10-k, 10-q or 8-k, or any other public filing or announcement which includes the combined results of operations. the foregoing summary of the agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of the agreements included as exhibits 5 and 6 of this ---------------- schedule 13d and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. upon consummation of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of the issuer, as in effect immediately prior to the merger, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the issuer until thereafter amended. other than as described above, cascade currently has no plan or proposals which relate to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a) - (j) of schedule 13d (although cascade reserves the right to develop such plans). item 5. interest in securities

and such shares constitute approximately 5.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of issuer common stock as of march 24, 1997. if the ascend stock option is exercised, cascade will have the right to acquire 24,025,741 shares of issuer common stock. if acquired, cascade would have sole voting and dispositive power over such shares, and such shares would constitute approximately 16.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of the issuer common stock as of march 24, 1997. to cascade's knowledge, no shares of issuer common stock are beneficially owned by any of the persons named in schedule a, except for 245,011 shares held by matrix partners iii, l.p., of which matrix iii management company is a general partner of which paul j. ferri, a current director of cascade, is a general partner.

cascade stock option agreement (the "agreement") is made and entered into as of march 30, 1997 by and between cascade communications corp., a delaware corporation ("cascade"), and ascend communications, inc., a delaware corporation ("ascend"). recitals concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, cascade, ascend, and catskill merger corporation, a delaware corporation and a wholly- owned subsidiary of ascend ("sub"), are entering into an agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of march 30, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), which provides for the merger of sub with and into cascade in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and the laws of the state of delaware (the "merger"). as a condition and inducement to ascend's willingness to enter into the merger agreement, ascend has requested that cascade agree, and cascade has agreed, to grant to ascend an option to acquire certain shares of cascade's authorized but unissued common stock, par value $.001 per share (together with any associated rights, "cascade common stock"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. now, therefore, to induce ascend to enter into the merger agreement and in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and in the merger agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows. capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the merger agreement. agreement section 1. grant of option. cascade hereby grants to ascend an irrevocable option (the "cascade option") to purchase a number of shares of cascade common stock equal to the option number (as defined in section 2(d)), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below. section 2. exercise and termination of the cascade option. (a) exercise. the cascade option may be exercised by ascend, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time prior to the termination of ascend's right to exercise the cascade option by the terms of this agreement and upon and after the occurrence of the earliest event which causes (i) the cascade termination fee or (ii) the cascade post-termination fee (in each case as defined in the merger agreement) to become payable (a "trigger event"). notwithstanding the foregoing, the cascade option may not be exercised if ascend is in breach in any material respect of any of its material representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this agreement or the merger agreement. (b) exercise procedure. in the event that ascend wishes to exercise the cascade option, ascend shall deliver to cascade written notice (an "exercise notice") specifying the total number of shares of cascade common stock that ascend wishes to purchase. to the extent permitted by law and the certificate of incorporation, as amended, of cascade (the "cascade charter"), and provided that the conditions set forth in section 3 to cascade's obligation to issue the shares of cascade common stock to ascend hereunder have been satisfied or waived, ascend shall, upon delivery of the exercise notice and tender of the applicable aggregate exercise price, immediately be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of cascade common stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of cascade shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of cascade common stock shall not theretofore have been delivered to ascend. each closing of a purchase of shares of cascade common stock hereunder (a "closing") shall occur at a place, on a date, and at a time designated by ascend in an exercise notice delivered at least two (2) business days prior to the date of such closing. b-1 (c) termination of the cascade option. ascend's right to exercise the cascade option shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the effective time of the merger; (ii) the date on which the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to article viii thereof other than under circumstances which also constitute a trigger event under this agreement; and (iii) (a) in the event the cascade option becomes exercisable pursuant to clause (i) of section 2(a), the date two hundred seventy (270) days after the date on which the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to article viii thereof under circumstances which also constitute a trigger event under clause (i) of section 2(a), or (b) in the event the cascade option becomes exercisable pursuant to clause (ii) of section 2(a), the later of (i) the date two hundred seventy (270) days after the date on which the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to article viii thereof under circumstances which also constitute a trigger event under clause (ii) of section 2(a) and (ii) the date one hundred eighty (180) days after the date on which the cascade option becomes exercisable pursuant to clause (ii) of section 2(a). notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to clause (iii) in the immediately preceding sentence, if the cascade option cannot be exercised by reason of any applicable judicial or governmental judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, the cascade option shall remain exercisable and shall not terminate until the earlier of (x) the date on which such impediment shall become final and not subject to appeal and (y) 5:00 p.m., pacific standard time, on the tenth (10th) business day after such impediment shall have been removed; provided, however, that if such judgment, decree, or order shall have been obtained at the request of cascade or any of its affiliates or a party that has made or is proposing to make a competing offer (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) for cascade, and such judgment, decree or order is vacated, set aside, withdrawn, reversed or otherwise nullified, the time during which the cascade option shall remain exercisable shall be extended for as long as such judgment, decree, or order shall be in effect. the rights of ascend set forth in sections 7 and 9 shall not terminate upon termination of ascend's right to exercise the cascade option with respect to shares acquired prior to such termination, but shall extend to the time provided in such sections. notwithstanding the termination of the cascade option, ascend shall be entitled to purchase the shares of cascade common stock with respect to which ascend had exercised the cascade option prior to such termination. (d) option number. the aggregate number of shares of cascade common stock issuable upon exercise of this cascade option (the "option number") shall initially be the number of shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to nineteen and nine-tenths percent (19.9%) of the total number of shares of cascade common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this agreement, and shall be adjusted hereafter to reflect changes in cascade's capitalization occurring after the date hereof in accordance with section 10. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in no event shall the option number exceed nineteen and nine-tenths percent (19.9%) of the total number of shares of cascade common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this agreement, adjusted in accordance with section 10. (e) exercise price. the purchase price per share of cascade common stock pursuant to the cascade option (the "exercise price") shall be payable, at ascend's election, in cash (a "cash exercise") or in shares (a "stock exercise") of ascend common stock, $.001 par value per share ("ascend common stock"). the exercise price per share of cascade common stock, (i) in the case of a cash exercise, shall be a cash amount equal to $36.40 (the "cash exercise price"), and (ii) in the case of a stock exercise, shall be seven tenths (.7) of a share of ascend common stock (the "stock exercise price"). (f) certain limitations. in the event ascend would receive aggregate, cumulative net proceeds (as defined below) of more than eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000) in connection with the sale (or other disposition) to any third party of the shares of cascade common stock acquired pursuant to the cascade option (other than a sale of such shares pursuant to section 7), all net proceeds in excess of such amount shall be remitted to cascade promptly upon receipt. "net proceeds" shall mean the aggregate proceeds of such sale or disposition in excess of the product of the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares of cascade common b-2 stock included in such sale or disposition. notwithstanding anything in this agreement or in the merger agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate amount payable by cascade to ascend and its affiliates pursuant to section 7 of this agreement and the provisions of section 8.3(b) of the merger agreement shall not exceed the sum of eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000) plus, in the case of payments pursuant to sections 7(a)(ii) and 7(b)(ii) of this agreement, the aggregate exercise price for the shares of cascade common stock repurchased by cascade from ascend pursuant to section 7 of this agreement, it being understood that the limitation contained in this sentence shall not limit the amounts receivable by ascend from persons other than cascade, including without limitation amounts receivable pursuant to a tender offer or other purchase and sale transaction. section 3. conditions to closing. the obligation of cascade to issue the shares of cascade common stock to ascend hereunder is subject to the conditions that (a) all waiting periods, if any, under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1975, as amended (the "hsr act"), applicable to the issuance of the shares of cascade common stock by cascade and the acquisition of such shares by ascend hereunder (and, in the case of a stock exercise, the issuance of shares of ascend common stock by ascend and the acquisition of such shares by cascade) shall have expired or have been terminated; (b) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise restraining such issuance shall be in effect; and (c) all consents, approvals, orders, authorizations and permits of any federal, state, local or foreign governmental authority, if any, required in connection with the issuance of the shares of cascade common stock and the acquisition of such shares by ascend hereunder (and, in the case of a stock exercise, the issuance of shares of ascend common stock and the acquisition of such shares by cascade) shall have been obtained. section 4. closing. at any closing: (a) cascade shall deliver to ascend or its designee a single certificate in definitive form representing the number of shares of cascade common stock designated by ascend in its exercise notice, such certificate to be registered in the name of ascend and to bear the legend set forth in section 11; and (b) ascend shall deliver to cascade the aggregate exercise price for the shares of cascade common stock so designated and being purchased by (i) wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified in writing by cascade (in the case of a cash exercise), or (ii) subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions, delivery of a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of ascend common stock being issued by ascend in consideration thereof (in the case of a stock exercise). effective at or prior to the closing, cascade shall cause the shares of cascade common stock being delivered at the closing to be approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market, and ascend shall cause the shares of ascend common stock being delivered at the closing pursuant to a stock exercise to be approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market. section 5. representations and warranties of cascade. cascade represents and warrants to ascend as follows: (a) organization and standing. cascade is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and has all corporate power and authority required to enter into this agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder.

(a) ascend "put". at any time during which the cascade option is exercisable pursuant to section 2 (the "purchase period"), upon written notice to cascade by ascend (the "repurchase notice"): (i) cascade and its successors in interest shall repurchase from ascend all or any portion of the cascade option, as specified by ascend, to the extent not previously exercised, at the option repurchase price set forth in section 7(b)(i), subject to and as limited by section 2(f) above; and (ii) cascade and its successors in interest shall repurchase from ascend all or any portion of the shares of cascade common stock purchased by ascend pursuant to the cascade option, as specified by ascend, at the share repurchase price set forth in section 7(b)(ii) subject to and as limited by section 2(f) above. b-5 (b) certain definitions. for purposes of this section 7, the following definitions shall apply: (i) option repurchase price. "option repurchase price" shall mean (a) the amount (if any) by which the fair market value (as defined in section 7(b)(iii)) of a single share of cascade common stock as of the date of the applicable repurchase notice exceeds the per share exercise price, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of cascade common stock purchasable pursuant to the cascade option or the portion thereof covered by the applicable repurchase notice. (ii) share repurchase price. "share repurchase price" shall mean the product of (a) the greater of (i) the exercise price paid by ascend per share of cascade common stock acquired pursuant to the cascade option and (ii) the fair market value (as defined in section 7(b)(iii)) of a single share of cascade common stock as of the date of the applicable repurchase notice, and (b) the number of shares of cascade common stock to be repurchased pursuant to this section 7 as covered by the applicable repurchase notice. (iii) fair market value. as used in this agreement, "fair market value" shall mean, with respect to any security, the per share average of the last reported sale prices on the nasdaq national market (or such other national stock exchange or national market system as shall then be the primary trading market for such security) for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the applicable date. (c) redelivery of shares of ascend common stock. in cascade's discretion or if specified by ascend in the repurchase notice, all or a portion of the share repurchase price shall be paid by cascade in shares of ascend common stock, by redelivery to ascend of the shares of ascend common stock (and the certificate(s) representing such shares) previously delivered by ascend to cascade pursuant to a stock exercise. for purposes of this section 7(c), each share of ascend common stock redelivered to ascend shall be valued at and exchanged for 1.428 shares of cascade common stock. if fewer than all of the shares of cascade common stock purchased by ascend pursuant to a stock exercise are to be repurchased by cascade pursuant to section 7(a)(ii), ascend shall issue to cascade new certificates representing those shares of ascend common stock which are not due to be redelivered to ascend pursuant to this section 7(c) to the extent that excess shares of ascend common stock are included in the certificates redelivered to ascend by cascade. all shares of ascend common stock redelivered to ascend hereunder shall be free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any nature whatsoever. (d) payment and redelivery of cascade options or shares. in the event that ascend exercises its rights under section 7(a), cascade shall, within ten (10) business days thereafter, pay the required amount to ascend in immediately available funds (or shares of ascend common stock, if applicable) and ascend shall surrender to cascade the cascade option or the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of cascade common stock purchased by ascend pursuant hereto, and ascend shall warrant that it has sole beneficial ownership of the cascade option or such shares and that the cascade option or such shares are then free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any nature whatsoever. (e) repurchase price reduced at ascend's option. in the event that payment of the repurchase price specified in section 7(a) would subject the repurchase of the cascade option or the shares of cascade common stock purchased by ascend pursuant to the cascade option to a vote of the stockholders of cascade pursuant to applicable law, regulations, or requirements of a national securities exchange or national market system or the cascade charter, then ascend may, at its election, reduce the repurchase price or the number of shares covered by the ascend repurchase request to an amount which would permit such repurchase without the necessity for such a vote. section 8. restrictions on transfer. (a) restrictions on transfer. prior to the fifth anniversary of the date hereof (the "expiration date"), neither party shall, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, sell, assign, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of capital stock of the other party acquired by such party pursuant to this agreement, including any shares of ascend common stock issued pursuant to a stock exercise ("restricted b-6 shares"), or otherwise beneficially owned (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act) by such other party, other than (i) pursuant to section 7 or (ii) in accordance with sections 8(b) or 9. (b) permitted sales. following the termination of the merger agreement, a party shall be permitted to sell any restricted shares beneficially owned by it if such sale is made (i) pursuant to a tender or exchange offer or other business combination transaction that has been approved or recommended, or otherwise determined to be fair to and in the best interests of the holders of common stock of the other party, by a majority of the members of the board of directors of such other party, or (ii) subject to section 8(c) or (d) as the case may be, to a person who, immediately following such sale, would beneficially own (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act), either alone or as part of a "group" (as used in rule 13d-5 under the exchange act), not more than ten percent (10%) of such party's outstanding voting securities, which person is a passive institutional investor who would be eligible under rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the exchange act to report such holdings of restricted shares on schedule 13g under the exchange act. (c) cascade's right of first refusal. at any time after the first occurrence of a trigger event and prior to the expiration date if ascend shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of cascade common stock or other securities acquired by it pursuant to the cascade option, it shall give cascade written notice of the proposed transaction (an "ascend offer notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. an ascend offer notice shall be deemed an offer by ascend to cascade, which may be accepted within five (5) business days of the receipt of such ascend offer notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which ascend is proposing to transfer such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of any such shares or other securities by cascade shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to ascend in immediately available funds. in the event of the failure or refusal of cascade to purchase all the shares or other securities covered by a ascend offer notice, ascend may sell all, but not less than all, of such shares or other securities to the proposed transferee at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the transferee than those set forth in the ascend offer notice as long as such sale is completed within ninety (90) days of the receipt by cascade of the applicable ascend offer notice; provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not limit the rights ascend may otherwise have in the event cascade has accepted the offer contained in the ascend offer notice and wrongfully refuses to purchase the shares or other securities subject thereto. the requirements of this section 8(c) shall not apply to (i) any disposition as a result of which the proposed transferee would own beneficially not more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding voting power of cascade, (ii) any disposition of cascade common stock or other securities by a person to whom ascend has assigned its rights under the cascade option with the consent of cascade, (iii) any sale by means of a public offering registered under the securities act, or (iv) any transfer to a wholly-owned subsidiary of ascend which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. (d) ascend's right of first refusal. at any time after the first occurrence of a trigger event and prior to the expiration date, if cascade shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of ascend common stock or other securities acquired by it pursuant to a stock exercise of the cascade option by ascend, it shall give ascend written notice of the proposed transaction (a "cascade offer notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. a cascade offer notice shall be deemed an offer by cascade to ascend, which may be accepted within five (5) business days of the receipt of such cascade offer notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which cascade is proposing to transfer such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of any such shares or other securities by ascend shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to cascade in immediately available funds. in the event of the failure or refusal of ascend to purchase all the shares or other securities covered by a cascade offer notice, cascade may sell all, but not less than all, of such shares or other securities to the proposed transferee at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the transferee than those set forth in the cascade b-7 offer notice as long as such sale is completed within ninety (90) days of the receipt by ascend of the applicable cascade offer notice; provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not limit the rights cascade may otherwise have in the event ascend has accepted the offer contained in the cascade offer notice and wrongfully refuses to purchase the shares or other securities subject thereto. the requirements of this section 8(d) shall not apply to (i) any disposition as a result of which the proposed transferee would own beneficially not more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding voting power of ascend, (ii) any sale by means of a public offering registered under the securities act, or (iii) any transfer to a wholly-owned subsidiary of cascade which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. (e) additional restrictions. prior to any permitted sales of any restricted shares under of section 8(b)(ii), the holder thereof shall give written notice to the issuer of such restricted shares of its intention to effect such transfer. each such notice shall describe the manner of the proposed transfer and, if requested by the issuer of such restricted shares, shall be accompanied by an opinion of counsel satisfactory to such issuer (it being agreed that each of gray cary ware & freidenrich, a professional corporation, and testa, hurwitz & thibeault, llp shall be satisfactory) to the effect that such sale may be effected without registration under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. each certificate for restricted shares transferred as above provided shall bear the legend set forth in section 11, except that such certificate shall not bear such legend if (i) such transfer is in accordance with the provisions of rule 144 (or any other rule permitting public sale without registration under the securities act) or (ii) the opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that the transferee and any subsequent transferee would be entitled to transfer such securities in a public sale without registration under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. the restrictions provided for in this section 8(e) shall not apply to securities which are not required to bear the legend prescribed by section 11 in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the foregoing restrictions on transferability shall terminate as to any particular shares when such shares shall have been effectively registered under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws and sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the registration statement covering such shares. section 9. registration rights. (a) procedure. following the termination of the merger agreement, either party hereto that owns restricted shares (a "holder") may by written notice (the "registration notice") to the other party (the "registrant") request the registrant to register under the securities act all or any part of the restricted shares acquired by such holder pursuant to this agreement (the "registrable securities") in order to permit the sale or other disposition of such shares pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment underwritten public offering, in which the holder and the underwriters shall effect as wide a distribution of such registrable securities as is reasonably practicable and shall use their best efforts to prevent any person (including any "group" as used in rule 13d-5 under the exchange act)) and its affiliates from purchasing through such offering restricted shares representing more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the registrant on a fully diluted basis (a "permitted offering"). any rights to require registration hereunder shall terminate with respect to any shares that may be sold pursuant to rule 144(k) under the securities act. (b) manager's certificate. the managing underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing, and shall be selected by (i) the registrant within ten (10) business days after receipt of a registration notice, subject to approval of the holder (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), or (ii) if registrant fails to deliver notice (the "registrant's designation notice") to holder of such selection within ten (10) business days after receipt of a registration notice, then by holder subject to the reasonable approval of registrant (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the "manager"), and holder shall deliver written notice (the "holder's designation notice") of such selection within ten (10) business days after expiration of the ten (10) day period in which registrant is entitled to give notice. the registrant's designation notice or the holder's designation notice, as the case may be, shall state that (i) the party delivering such notice and its proposed manager have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering, and (ii) such proposed manager in good faith believes that, based on the then-prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities to the public in a permitted b-8 offering within one hundred twenty (120) days at a per share price equal to at least eighty percent (80%) of the then fair market value of such shares. (c) first refusal right. the registrant (and/or any person designated by the registrant) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to the holder within five (5) business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all or any part of the registrable securities proposed to be so sold for cash at a price equal to the product of (i) the number of registrable securities to be so purchased by the registrant and (ii) the then fair market value of such shares. (d) closing. any purchase of registrable securities by the registrant (or its designee) under section 9(c) shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the registrant or at the offices of its counsel at any reasonable date and time designated by the registrant and/or such designee in such notice within twenty (20) business days after delivery of such notice, and any payment for the shares to be so purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing in immediately available funds. (e) certain limitations. if the registrant does not elect to exercise its option pursuant to section 9(c) with respect to all registrable securities, it shall use its best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities proposed to be so sold; provided, however, that (i) neither party shall be entitled to demand more than an aggregate of two (2) effective registration statements hereunder, and (ii) the registrant will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed sixty (60) days after such request in the case of clause (a) below or ninety (90) days after such request in the case of clauses (b) and (c) below) when (a) the registrant is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, in the opinion of counsel to the registrant, such information would be required to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time; (b) the registrant is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) the registrant determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other transaction involving the registrant or any of its material subsidiaries and that such transaction is material to the registrant and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. if consummation of the sale of any registrable securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effectiveness of the initial registration statement, the provisions of this section 9 shall again be applicable to any proposed registration. (f) state securities laws. the registrant shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 9 to be qualified for sale under the securities laws of such states as the holder may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that the registrant shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. (g) obligations of registrant. the registrant shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as is customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. the registration rights set forth in this section 9 are subject to the condition that the holder shall provide the registrant with such information with respect to its registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to the holder as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the registrant, is necessary to enable the registrant to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. (h) indemnification. in connection with any registration effected under this section 9, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner, (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary for transactions of such type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering, and (iii) to take all further actions which shall be reasonably b-9 necessary to effect such registration and sale (including, if the manager deems it necessary, participating in road-show presentations). (i) inclusion of additional shares of registrant. the registrant shall be entitled to include (at its expense) additional shares of its common stock in a registration effected pursuant to this section 9 only if and to the extent the manager determines that such inclusion will not adversely affect the prospects for success of such offering. section 10. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. (a) without limiting any restriction on cascade contained in this agreement or in the merger agreement, in the event of any change in cascade common stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, merger (other than the merger), recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or any similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the cascade option, and the exercise price per share provided herein, shall be adjusted appropriately and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that ascend shall receive, upon exercise of the cascade option, the number and class of securities or property that ascend would have received in respect of the shares of cascade common stock issuable to ascend if the cascade option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable. in addition, without limiting any restriction on ascend or cascade contained in this agreement or the merger agreement, in the event of any change in ascend common stock or cascade common stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, merger (other than the merger), recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, equitable adjustment shall be made to the other provisions hereof to carry out the original intent of this agreement. (b) in the event that cascade shall enter into an agreement: (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than ascend or one of its subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger; (ii) to permit any person, other than ascend or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into cascade and cascade shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then- outstanding shares of cascade common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of cascade or any other person or cash or any other property; or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than ascend or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that upon the consummation of such transaction and upon the subsequent exercise of the cascade option, ascend shall be entitled to receive, for each share of cascade common stock with respect to which the cascade option has not theretofore been exercised, an amount of consideration in the form of and equal to the per share amount of consideration that would be received by the holder of one share of cascade common stock (and, in the event of an election or similar arrangement with respect to the type of consideration to be received by the holders of cascade common stock, subject to the foregoing, proper provision shall be made so that the holder of the cascade option would have the same election or similar rights as would the holder of the number of shares of cascade common stock for which the cascade option is then exercisable). section 11. restrictive legends. each certificate representing shares of cascade common stock issued to ascend hereunder, and shares of ascend common stock, if any, delivered to cascade pursuant to a stock exercise, shall include a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities or blue sky laws, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the cascade stock option agreement dated as of march 30, 1997, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer upon request. it is understood and agreed that (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the securities act and state securities or blue sky laws in the foregoing legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such b-10 reference if ascend or cascade, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the other party a copy of a letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act or such laws; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this agreement in the foregoing legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 9 shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in this section 11. section 12. binding effect; no assignment; no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. except as expressly provided for in this agreement, neither this agreement nor the rights or obligations of either party hereto are assignable, except by operation of law, or with the written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment in violation of this agreement shall be void and of no force or effect. nothing contained in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted assigns any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever. any restricted shares sold by a party in compliance with the provisions of section 9 shall, upon consummation of such sale, be free of the restrictions imposed and the benefits provided with respect to such shares by this agreement. section 13. specific performance. the parties hereto recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, whether at law or in equity, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent or restrain any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this agreement, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any court of the state of delaware or of the united states of america located in the state of delaware. in the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of delaware and of the united states of america located in the city of wilmington in the state of delaware for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and waives any objection to venue in any such court therein. section 14. validity. (a) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. (b) in the event any court or other governmental or regulatory authority holds any provisions of this agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith the execution and delivery of an amendment to this agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision and the economic effects thereof. (c) if for any reason any such court or other governmental or regulatory authority determines that ascend is not permitted to acquire, or cascade is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to section 7, the full number of shares of cascade common stock provided in this agreement (as the same may be adjusted), it is the express intention of cascade to allow ascend to acquire or to require cascade to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any other amendment or modification hereof. (d) each party agrees that, should any court or other governmental or regulatory authority hold any provision of this agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action b-11 inconsistent herewith, or not take any action required herein, the other party shall not be entitled to specific performance of such provision or part hereof or to any other remedy, including but not limited to money damages, for breach hereof or of any other provision of this agreement or part hereof as the result of such holding or order. section 15. notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if (a) delivered personally, or (b) if sent by overnight courier service (receipt confirmed in writing), or (c) if delivered by facsimile transmission (with receipt confirmed), or (d) five (5) days after being mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) to the parties in each case to the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice): if to cascade, to: cascade communications corp. 5 carlisle road westford, ma 01886 facsimile no.: (508) 692-1221 attention: president and corporate counsel with a copy to: testa, hurwitz & thibeault, llp high street tower 125 high street boston, ma 02110 fax number: (617) 248-7100 attention: john a. meltaus, esq. if to ascend, to: ascend communications, inc. one ascend plaza 1701 harbor bay parkway alameda, ca 94502 facsimile no.: (510) 769-6001 attention: president with a copy to: gray cary ware & freidenrich a professional corporation 400 hamilton avenue palo alto, ca 94301 fax number: (415) 327-3699 attention: gregory m. gallo, esq. & rod j. howard, esq. section 16. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed, and any controversy arising out of or otherwise relating to this agreement shall be determined, in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state and without regard to its choice of law principles. each party hereto consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the state of delaware and the courts of the united states located in such state for the adjudication of any action, suit, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of or otherwise relating to this agreement. section 17. interpretation. the headings contained in this agreement are for reference purposes and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the agreement. when reference is made in this agreement to a section, such reference shall be to a section of this agreement, unless otherwise indicated. whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this agreement, they shall be deemed b-12 to be followed by the words "without limitation." whenever "or" is used in this agreement it shall be construed in the nonexclusive sense. the words "herein," "hereby," "hereof," "hereto," "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this agreement. section 18. counterparts;

ascend stock option agreement (the "agreement") is made and entered into as of march 30, 1997 by and between ascend communications, inc., a delaware corporation ("ascend"), and cascade communications corp., a delaware corporation ("cascade"). recitals concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, ascend, cascade, and cascade merger corporation, a delaware corporation and a wholly- owned subsidiary of ascend ("sub"), are entering into an agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of march 30, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), which provides for the merger of sub with and into cascade in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and the laws of the state of delaware (the "merger"). as a condition and inducement to cascade's willingness to enter into the

(ii) share repurchase price. "share repurchase price" shall mean the product of (a) the greater of (i) the exercise price paid by cascade per share of ascend common stock acquired pursuant to the ascend option and (ii) the fair market value (as defined in section 7(b)(iii)) of a single share of ascend common stock as of the date of the applicable repurchase notice, and (b) the number of shares of ascend common stock to be repurchased pursuant to this section 7 as covered by the applicable repurchase notice.

(c) ascend's right of first refusal. at any time after the first occurrence of a trigger event and prior to the expiration date, if cascade shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of ascend common stock or other securities acquired by it pursuant to the ascend option, it shall give ascend written notice of the proposed transaction (a "cascade offer notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. a cascade offer notice shall be deemed an offer by cascade to ascend, which may be accepted within five (5) business days of the receipt of such cascade offer notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which cascade is proposing to transfer such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of any such shares or other securities by ascend shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to cascade in immediately available funds. in the event of the failure or refusal of ascend to purchase all the shares or other securities covered by a cascade offer notice, cascade may sell all, but not less than all, of such shares or other securities to the proposed transferee at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the transferee than those set forth in the cascade offer notice as long as such sale is completed within ninety (90) days of the receipt by ascend of the applicable cascade offer notice; provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not limit the rights cascade may otherwise have in the event ascend has accepted the offer contained in the cascade offer notice and wrongfully refuses to purchase the shares or other securities subject thereto. the requirements of this section 8(c) shall not apply to (i) any disposition as a result of which the proposed transferee would own beneficially not more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding voting power of ascend, (ii) any disposition of ascend common stock or other securities by a person to whom cascade has assigned its rights under the ascend option with the consent of ascend, (iii) any sale by means of a public offering registered under the securities act, or (iv) any transfer to a wholly-owned subsidiary of cascade which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. (d) cascade's right of first refusal. at any time after the first occurrence of a trigger event and prior to the expiration date, if ascend shall desire to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares of cascade common stock or other securities acquired by it pursuant to a stock exercise of the ascend option by cascade, it shall give cascade written notice of the proposed transaction (a "ascend offer notice"), identifying the proposed transferee, accompanied by a copy of a binding offer to purchase such shares or other securities signed by such transferee and setting forth the terms of the proposed transaction. an ascend offer notice shall be deemed an offer by ascend to cascade, which may be accepted within five (5) business days of the receipt of such ascend offer notice, on the same terms and conditions and at the same price at which ascend is proposing to transfer such shares or other securities to such transferee. the purchase of any such shares or other securities by cascade shall be settled within five (5) business days of the date of the acceptance of the offer and the purchase price shall be paid to ascend in immediately available funds. in the event of the failure or refusal of cascade to purchase all the shares or other securities covered by a ascend offer notice, ascend may sell all, but not less than all, of such shares or other securities to the proposed transferee at no less than the price specified and on terms no more favorable to the transferee than those set forth in the ascend offer notice as long as such sale is completed within ninety (90) days of the receipt by cascade of the applicable ascend offer notice; provided that the c-7 provisions of this sentence shall not limit the rights ascend may otherwise have in the event cascade has accepted the offer contained in the ascend offer notice and wrongfully refuses to purchase the shares or other securities subject thereto. the requirements of this section 8(d) shall not apply to (i) any disposition as a result of which the proposed transferee would own beneficially not more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding voting power of cascade, (ii) any sale by means of a public offering registered under the securities act, or (iii) any transfer to a wholly- owned subsidiary of ascend which agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof. (e) additional restrictions. prior to any permitted sales of any restricted shares under section 8(b)(ii), the holder thereof shall give written notice to the issuer of such restricted shares of its intention to effect such transfer. each such notice shall describe the manner of the proposed transfer and, if requested by the issuer of such restricted shares, shall be accompanied by an opinion of counsel satisfactory to such issuer (it being agreed that each of gray cary ware & freidenrich and testa, hurwitz & thibeault, llp shall be satisfactory) to the effect that such sale may be effected without registration under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. each certificate for restricted shares transferred as above provided shall bear the legend set forth in section 11, except that such certificate shall not bear such legend if (i) such transfer is in accordance with the provisions of rule 144 (or any other rule permitting public sale without registration under the securities act) or (ii) the opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that the transferee and any subsequent transferee would be entitled to transfer such securities in a public sale without registration under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. the restrictions provided for in this section 8(e) shall not apply to securities which are not required to bear the legend prescribed by section 11 in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the foregoing restrictions on transferability shall terminate as to any particular shares when such shares shall have been effectively registered under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws and sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the registration statement covering such shares. section 9. registration rights.

(b) manager's certificate. the managing underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing, and shall be selected by (i) the registrant within ten (10) business days after receipt of a registration notice, subject to approval of the holder (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), or (ii) if registrant fails to deliver notice (the "registrant's designation notice") to holder of such selection within ten (10) business days after receipt of a registration notice, then by holder subject to the reasonable approval of registrant (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the "manager"), and holder shall deliver written notice (the "holder's designation notice") of such selection within ten (10) business days after expiration of the ten (10) day period in which registrant is entitled to give notice. the registrant's designation notice or the holder's designation notice, as the case may be, shall state that (i) the party delivering such notice and its proposed manager have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering, and (ii) such proposed manager in good faith believes that, based on the then-prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities to the public in a permitted offering within one hundred twenty (120) days at a per share price equal to at least eighty percent (80%) of the then fair market value of such shares. c-8 (c) first refusal right. the registrant (and/or any person designated by the registrant) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to the holder within five (5) business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all or any part of the registrable securities proposed to be so sold for cash at a price equal to the product of (i) the number of registrable securities to be so purchased by the registrant and (ii) the then fair market value of such shares. (d) closing. any purchase of registrable securities by the registrant (or its designee) under section 9(c) shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the registrant or at the offices of its counsel at any reasonable date and time designated by the registrant and/or such designee in such notice within twenty (20) business days after delivery of such notice, and any payment for the shares to be so purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing in immediately available funds.

(ii) the reference to the provisions of this agreement in the foregoing legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 9 shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in this section 11. section 12. binding effect;
