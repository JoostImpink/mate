(e) &#150; not applicable. (f) &#150; all individual reporting persons are u.s. citizens. times 11 llc is a delaware limited liability company that was formed on march 23, 2011. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration not applicable. item 4. purpose of transaction on february 28, 2017, a person representing the reporting persons (&#147;investors&#148;), informed the issuer that, if investor commitments for at least $8 million were obtained, the investors proposed to purchase for between $8 million and $20 million units consisting of common stock and a new preferred stock of the issuer. the communication included a draft term sheet relating to the proposed investment. as the issuer was told that at that time, the investor commitments were less than the minimum amount necessary to cause agreements regarding the commitments that had been made to be effective. therefore, the investors&#146; commitments were not at the time effective. one of the conditions to the proposed financing was that all the officers and directors of the issuer resign and persons designated by the investors be elected to the board. on march 4, 2017, the issuer issued a press release in which it announced that it had received a proposal from two investor groups, one of which was the investors. on the same day, the issuer&#146;s lawyers sent a lawyer for representatives of the investors a brief comparison of the two financing proposals and said that the issuer&#146;s board had deemed the investor proposal to be far inferior to the other proposal. on march 8, a representative of the investors responded, through lawyers, that the investors had no interest in investing on the terms of the other proposal, and in view of the board&#146;s belief that the investor proposal was far inferior to the other proposal, the investors were withdrawing their proposal. however, the representative of the investors said that if the other group is not able to provide the described financing, or for any other reason the issuer&#146;s board decides that it would like to pursue a financing by the investors on the terms they had proposed, the principal investors would try to revive that proposal. despite the fact that the investors had withdrawn their proposal, in order to be prepared to provide funds they believe are critical to the issuer if the issuer asked them to revive their proposal, by march 19, 2017, all the investors agreed that they would commit to invest even though there were only $6 million in commitments. therefore, their commitments became effective. on march 20, 2017, the issuer announced that it had entered into a definitive financing commitment term sheet with a group of its shareholders. the press release containing that announcement said that the issuer had previously received two unsolicited proposals relating to potential equity financings and that its board of directors had rejected the investors&#146; proposal because, among other reasons, &#147;the financial terms of [the proposal] were determined to be detrimental to the future of the company as an ongoing concern.&#148; on march 23, 2017, the issuer filed a report on form 8-k with the securities and exchange commission in which it described the terms of an amended and restated definitive commitment term sheet. what it described was a financing in the form of a secured convertible loan, secured by a first priority security interest in the issuer&#146;s intellectual property. on march 24, 2017, a representative of the investors sent a letter to the directors of the issuer in which he said that the transaction described in the form 8-k would constitute a waste of corporate assets and that unless the investors receive assurance by march 27, 2017 that the issuer will not enter into the transaction described in the form 8-k, they are going to institute litigation in the delaware courts to prevent the issuer from entering into that transaction and to hold the directors personally liable for the costs the issuer has incurred in connection with that transaction and in connection with a recently terminated rights offering. on march 27, a lawyer for the issuer responded by stating that if the investors made a proposal that did not involve peter r. culpepper, the issuer&#146;s board would consider it. on march 28, 2017, the representative of the investors responded that they would accept that condition and stated that the investors would like to begin right away working on the documents regarding the financing transaction they have proposed. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a)&#151;the aggregate number of shares to which this schedule 13d relates is 28,806,558 shares, representing 7.90% of the 364,773,297 shares outstanding as reported by the issuer in its form 10-q filed with the securities exchange commission on november 9, 2016, adjusted to take account of a reset which resulted in the issuance of additional shares. the reporting persons own those shares as follows: name shares of common stock (1) % of class of common charles littlejohn 1,956,790 * jeffrey a. morris 17,000,000 4.66% james f boyle jr credit shelter trust 15,000 * john g. gazonas 2,350,000 * james d. watson 100,000 * times 11, llc 1,330,000 * steve smith 780,000 * al schwenck 45,000 * marta schwenck 45,000 * jean stack 1,000,000 * bill reinhard 0 0.00% scott webber 60,000 * hugh g. nolan 250,000 * courtlandt g. miller 396,370 * peter r. culpepper 3,474,998 * robert taurosa 0 0.00% marc kelley 31,150 * (1) includes shares issuable upon exercise of warrants, which are currently exercisable. * indicates less than 1% ownership.

proposal to acquire units or any agreement with provectus relating to the purchase of units by the investors, except to the extent that information has been disclosed in filings with the sec or has otherwise been disclosed to the public, and except that nothing in this section 8.1 will prevent any investor from including all required information in all filings the investor is required to make with the sec or any other governmental agency. the investor acknowledges that the investor is aware that it may be unlawful for the investor to purchase or sell securities of provectus while in possession of information regarding the investors&#146;
