(the "nyse") of lucent common stock (as reported on the nyse composite transactions tape as such tape is reported in the wall street journal or another recognized business -3- 5 publication) on the date immediately preceding the date on which the effective time shall occur (or, if the lucent common stock did not trade on the nyse on such prior date, the last day of trading in lucent common stock on the nyse prior to the effective time) by (ii) the fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. lucent shall make available to the exchange agent the cash necessary for this purpose. 1.8. exchange procedures; distributions with respect to unexchanged shares; stock transfer books. (a) as of the effective time, lucent shall deposit with the exchange agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of company common stock, certificates representing shares of the lucent common stock to be issued pursuant to section 1.5(c) in exchange for the shares of company common stock. such shares of lucent common stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to sections 1.7 and 1.8(c), are referred to herein as the "exchange fund". (b) as soon as practicable after the effective time, lucent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the exchange agent to send to each person who was, at the effective time, a holder of record of certificates which represented outstanding company common stock (the "certificates") which shares were converted into the right to receive lucent common stock pursuant to section 1.5(c), a letter of transmittal which (i) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to such certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery thereof to the exchange agent and (ii) shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates. upon surrender to the exchange agent of certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as the exchange agent may reasonably require, such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of lucent common stock into which the company common stock represented by the surrendered certificate shall have been converted at the effective time, (b) cash in lieu of any fractional share of lucent common stock in accordance with section 1.7 and (c) certain dividends and distributions in accordance with section 1.8(c), and the certificates so surrendered shall then be canceled. subject to section 1.7 and section 1.8(c), until surrendered as contemplated by this section 1.8(b), each certificate, from and after the effective time shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the number of shares of lucent common stock into which such company common stock shall have been converted. (c) no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the effective time with respect to the lucent common stock with a record date after the effective time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of the merger to receive certificates representing lucent common stock and no cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of lucent common stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to section 1.7 until such holder shall have surrendered its certificates pursuant to this section 1.8. subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such certificate, such holder shall be paid, in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of lucent common stock represented by the certificate received by such holder and having a record date on or after the effective time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of lucent common stock and having a record date on or -4- 6 after the effective time but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or after such surrender. (d) if any certificate representing shares of lucent common stock or any cash is to be issued or paid to any person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such exchange that such surrendered certificate shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such person either (i) shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance of such certificates of lucent common stock and the distribution of such cash payment to such person or (ii) shall establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. lucent or the exchange agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of shares of company common stock such amounts as lucent or the exchange agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by lucent or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of company common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by lucent or the exchange agent. all amounts in respect of taxes received or withheld by lucent shall be disposed of by lucent in accordance with the code or such state, local or foreign tax law, as applicable. (e) if any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other conditions as the board of directors of the surviving corporation may impose, the exchange agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the shares of lucent common stock as determined under section 1.5(c) and pay any cash, dividends or other distributions as determined in accordance with sections 1.7 and 1.8(c) in respect of such certificate; provided, that lucent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against lucent, the surviving corporation or the exchange agent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. 1.9. no further ownership rights in company common stock. all certificates representing shares of lucent common stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of the certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to section 1.7) shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the company common stock previously represented by such certificates. -5- 7 1.10. return of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the former holders of company common stock for six months after the effective time shall be delivered to lucent, upon its request, and any such former holders who have not theretofore surrendered to the exchange agent their certificates in compliance herewith shall thereafter look only to lucent for payment of their claim for shares of lucent common stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of lucent common stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of lucent common stock. none of lucent, acquisition, the exchange agent or the company shall be liable to any former holder of company common stock for any such shares of lucent common stock held in the exchange fund (and any cash, dividends and distributions payable in respect thereof) which are delivered to a public official pursuant to an official request under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 1.11. further assurances. if at any time after the effective time the surviving corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the surviving corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either the company or acquisition or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this agreement, the surviving corporation and its proper officers and directors or

any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, stock split, combination, stock or other dividend or any other change in the company's capital structure. to
