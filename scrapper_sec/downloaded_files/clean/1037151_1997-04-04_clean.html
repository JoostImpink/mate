(a)-(c) this schedule 13d is being filed by the hearst corporation, a delaware corporation ("hearst"), and the hearst family trust, a testamentary trust (the "trust," and together with hearst, the "reporting persons"). the agreement between the reporting persons relating to the joint filing of this schedule is attached as exhibit 7.1 hereto. hearst is one of the world's largest diversified communications companies, with interests in newspaper, magazine, book, and business publishing, television and radio broadcasting, cable network programming, newspaper features distribution, television production and distribution, and new media activities. all of hearst's issued and outstanding common stock is owned by the trust. hearst's principal executive offices are located at, and the address of the trust is, 959 eighth avenue, new york, new york 10019. schedule i hereto sets forth the name, business address and present principal occupation or employment and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted, for each of hearst's directors and executive officers and the trustees of the trust. (d)-(e) during the last five years, none of the reporting persons, nor, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the persons listed on schedule i hereto: (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors); or (ii) was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining further violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. (f) schedule i hereto sets forth the citizenship of each of hearst's directors and executive officers and the trustees of the trust. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. hearst and the persons set forth on schedule iii hereof (collectively referred to herein as the "stockholders"), have entered into the voting agreements described in item 4 below. as a result, hearst and the trust may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of approximately 67.8% of the issuer's series a common stock, on a fully diluted basis. 5 page 5 of 14 item 4. purpose of the transaction. on march 26, 1997, hearst, hat merger sub, inc. ("merger sub"), hat contribution sub, inc. ("contribution sub") and the issuer entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), providing for the contribution of certain assets by hearst and contribution sub to the issuer and the merger of merger sub with and into the issuer in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware (the "dgcl") (the "merger"). the issuer will be the surviving corporation in the merger (the "surviving corporation"), and the outstanding shares of capital stock of merger sub and the issuer will be converted or cancelled in the manner described below. prior to the effective time of the merger, the issuer will execute and file an amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "restated charter"), with the secretary of state of delaware, as provided in section 245 of the dgcl, in order to reclassify the issuer's capital stock. in such reclassification, the issuer's existing series b common stock and series c common stock will become series a common stock and a new series b common stock will be authorized which may only be held by hearst or entities controlled by hearst. the existing series a common stock will be entitled to elect two directors and the new series b common stock will be entitled to elect the remaining directors, but not less than a majority. in addition, the issuer's existing series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock will be given voting rights and will vote with the series a common stock as a single class. immediately thereafter and prior to the merger, hearst will contribute certain assets used in its television broadcast business to the issuer in exchange for 38,611,000 shares of issuer series b common stock. at the effective time of the merger, (i) each issued and outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of merger sub ("merger sub common stock") will be converted into and become one share of surviving corporation series b common stock; (ii) each share of issuer series a common stock, and issuer series b common stock, and each share of the issuer series a preferred stock and issuer series b preferred stock that is owned by the issuer as treasury stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist and no stock of the issuer or other consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor; (iii) each issued and outstanding share of issuer series b common stock will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of surviving corporation series b common stock; and (iv) each issued and outstanding share of issuer series a preferred stock will be converted into one share of surviving corporation series a preferred stock, and each issued and outstanding share of issuer series b preferred stock will be converted into one share of surviving corporation series b preferred stock. . at the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of issuer series a common stock will be converted into, at the election of each holder (i) the right to receive one share of surviving corporation series a common stock; (ii) the right to receive cash, without interest, in an amount equal to $26.50; or (iii) the right to receive 0.50 shares of surviving corporation series a common stock and cash, without interest, in the amount of $13.25. in addition, options outstanding with respect to issuer series a common stock, at the election of each optionholder, will (i) continue to represent options for an equal number of surviving corporation series a common stock (a "rollover election") or (ii) will be converted into the same consideration as a share of issuer series a common stock (subject to reduction for the option exercise price). stockholders and optionholders who elect all cash or all stock will be subject to proration to the extent that less than $100 million or more than approximately $160 million in cash consideration is elected by all stockholders. 6 page 6 of 14 if the merger is completed as planned, hearst will own between approximately 82% and 86% of the surviving corporation's series a common stock, on a fully diluted basis. the directors and officers of the surviving corporation will include the individuals listed on schedule ii, plus the eight additional directors that hearst is entitled to designate, and intends to designate, prior to the effective time of the merger. because approval of the issuer's stockholders is required by applicable law in order to adopt the restated charter and consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the issuer will submit the restated charter, the merger and the merger agreement to its stockholders for approval. concurrently with and as a further condition of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, each person set forth on schedule iii hereto (a "stockholder"), entered into a voting agreement with hearst (collectively, the "voting agreements"), relating to shares of the issuer's existing series a common stock, series b common stock and series c common stock currently owned by the stockholders, which represent an aggregate of 7,565,000 shares of series a common stock, on a fully diluted basis (the "subject shares"). the voting agreements provide that (i) if applicable, shares of series c common stock owned by a stockholder shall be converted to series a common stock, (i) the stockholders shall vote the subject shares in favor of (x) the restated charter, (y) the merger, and (z) the merger agreement, and (iii) the stockholders shall vote against certain other enumerated actions and agreements which include competing business combination transactions. the voting agreements also address the disposition of the subject shares by restricting the transfer of the subject shares until after the issuer's stockholders have approved the restated charter, the merger and the merger agreement when submitted to a vote as described above. furthermore, transfers of subject shares represented by shares of series b common stock will be restricted so that at least one such share is held by a permitted transferee specified in the issuer's existing certificate of incorporation (thereby entitling such permitted transferee to elect a majority of the issuer's directors until the restated charter becomes effective). concurrently with and as a further condition of the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, certain executive officers of the issuer agreed separately to waive their right to make a rollover election pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to options for issuer series a common stock currently held by each of them. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the voting agreements, the merger agreement and other agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, conformed copies of which are filed as exhibits 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5. 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 and 7.9 hereto, and which are incorporated herein for reference. other than as described above, the reporting persons have no plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d (although subject to the provisions of the merger agreement and the voting agreements, they reserve the right to develop such plans). item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b) as of march 26, 1997, the reporting persons owned no shares of series a common stock. however, as of march 26, 1997, under the definition of "beneficial ownership" as set forth in rule 13d-3 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, (the "exchange act"), hearst and the trust may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the subject shares pursuant to the voting agreements, which require the stockholders to vote in favor of the restated charter, the merger and the merger agreement. the trust, as the owner of all of hearst's issued and outstanding common stock, may be deemed to have the power to direct the voting of and disposition of the subject shares. as a result, hearst and the trust may be deemed to share the power to direct the voting of and the disposition of the subject shares. the subject shares constitute approximately 68.7% of the shares of series a common stock outstanding, on a fully diluted basis. 7 page 7 of 14 neither the filing of this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that hearst or the trust is the beneficial owner of the series a common stock referred to in this paragraph for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. (c) except as set forth in this item 5, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, none of the reporting persons or any other person described in item 2 hereof has beneficial ownership of, or has engaged in any transaction during the past 60 days in, any shares of series a common stock. (d) the reporting persons have no right to receive or power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the subject shares. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except as described herein, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) between the reporting persons and any other person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any securities of the issuer, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the securities of the issuer. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 7.1 joint filing agreement, dated april 3, 1997, between the hearst corporation and the hearst family trust relating to the filing of a joint statement on schedule 13d. exhibit 7.2 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and among the hearst corporation, argyle television investors, l.p. and ati general partner, l.p. exhibit 7.3 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and among the hearst corporation, television investment partners, l.p. and argyle television partners, l.p. exhibit 7.4 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and among the hearst corporation, argyle television partners, l.p. and argyle communications, inc. exhibit 7.5 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and between the hearst corporation and argyle foundation 8 page 8 of 14 exhibit 7.6 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and between the hearst corporation and the skylark foundation exhibit 7.7 voting agreement, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and between the hearst corporation and robin (a/k/a) robert hernreich. exhibit 7.8 agreement and plan of merger, dated as of march 26, 1997, by and among the hearst corporation, hat merger sub., inc., hat contribution sub, inc. and argyle television, inc. exhibit 7.9 waiver of rollover election, dated march 26, 1997, delivered to the issuer by bob marbut, blake byrne, ibra morales and harry hawks. 9 page 9 of 14 schedule i information regarding the directors and executive officers of hearst set forth in the table below is the name and the present principal occupation or employment of each director and executive officer of hearst. unless otherwise indicated, each person identified below is employed by hearst or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. the principal business address of hearst, the trust and, unless otherwise indicated, each person identified below, is 959 eighth avenue, new york, new york 10019. trustees of the trust are identified by an asterisk. unless otherwise indicated, all persons identified below are united states citizens. present office/principal name occupation or employment ---- ------------------------ george r. hearst, jr.* chairman of the board, chairman of executive committee, director frank a. bennack, jr.* president and chief executive officer, director gilbert c. maurer* executive vice president and chief operating officer, director victor f. ganzi* executive vice president, chief financial and legal officer, director david j. barrett vice president, director john g. conomikes* vice president, director robert j. danzig vice president, director george b. irish vice president, director raymond e. joslin vice president, director cathleen p. black director;

all shares of common stock previously designated as "series b common stock" or "series c common stock" which are then issued or outstanding automatically shall be reclassified as and changed into an equal number of shares of series a common stock without any action by the holders thereof. any such holder of a certificate representing shares of series b common stock or series c common stock which

entitled to vote separately as a class in order to elect five directors, and the holders of the shares of series a common stock -3- 84 shall be entitled to vote separately as a class in order to elect the remaining two directors. the designation of directors as the initial series a directors and series b directors, respectively, as of the time this amended and restated certificate of incorporation

and (i) the dividends payable on shares of series a common stock shall be payable only in series a common stock; and (ii) the dividends payable on shares of series b common stock shall be payable only in series b common stock. if the corporation shall in any manner split, divide, or combine the outstanding shares of series a or series b common stock, the -4- 85 outstanding shares of the other such series of common stock shall be proportionally split, divided, or combined in the same manner and on the same basis as the outstanding shares of series a or series b common stock, as the case may be,

shares of series a common stock represented thereby on such conversion date. 3. as promptly as practicable after the presentation and surrender for conversion, as herein provided, of any certificate for shares of series b common stock, the corporation shall issue and deliver at such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, certificates for the number of shares of series a common stock issuable upon such conversion. the issuance of certificates for shares of series a common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of series b common stock by the registered holder thereof shall be made without charge to the converting holder except for any tax that may be payable with respect to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the registered holder of the shares being converted, and the corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate unless and until the person requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the corporation the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the corporation that such tax has been paid. 4. upon any conversion of shares of series b common stock into shares of series a common stock pursuant to this subsection d, no adjustment with respect to dividends shall be made; only those dividends as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series b common stock on a date prior to the conversion date shall be payable on the shares so converted; and only those dividends as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series a common stock on or after such conversion date shall be payable on shares of series a common stock issued upon such conversion. 5. shares of the series b common stock converted into series a common stock shall be retired and shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of series b common stock. 6. such number of shares of series a common stock as may from time to time be required for such purpose shall be reserved for issuance upon conversion of (i) outstanding shares of series b common stock and (ii) shares of series b common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. -6- 87 7. notwithstanding any of the foregoing, subject to obtaining any fcc approvals required under subsection i below, at the time at which all permitted transferees (as defined in subsection e.1 below) first hold less than 20% of all shares of common stock which are then issued and outstanding, all shares of series b common stock which are issued and outstanding shall automatically be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of the series a common stock, on a share-for-share basis, and the corporation shall not be authorized to issue any additional shares of series b common stock. any holder of a certificate representing shares of series b common stock which are so converted may surrender such certificate to the corporation and receive in exchange therefor a new certificate representing an equal number of shares of series a common stock. any such certificates that formerly represented shares of series b common stock and that have not been so exchanged shall be deemed to represent the same number of shares of series a common stock. e. limitations on transfer of series b common stock 1. no holder of shares of series b common stock may transfer, and the corporation shall not register the transfer of, such shares of series b common stock, whether by sale, assignment, gift, bequest, appointment, or otherwise, unless (a) all fcc approvals required under subsection i below have been obtained and (b) the transfer is to a "permitted transferee" as provided herein. permitted transferees shall include the following: (i) the hearst corporation, which is a delaware corporation, or any other corporation into which the hearst corporation shall be merged or consolidated or to which all or substantially all of the assets of the hearst corporation shall be transferred (collectively, "hearst"); and (ii) any corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company or other entity a majority of the equity securities of which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by hearst. 2. any purported transfer of shares of series b common stock not permitted hereunder shall result in the conversion of the transferee's shares of series b common stock into shares of series a common stock, effective on the date on which certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer on the stock transfer record books of the corporation; provided, however, that if the corporation determines that such shares were not so presented for transfer within -7- 88 20 days after the date of such sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition, the transfer date shall be the actual date of such sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition as determined in good faith by the board of directors or its appointed agent. the corporation may, as a condition to the transfer or the registration of transfer of shares of series b common stock to a purported permitted transferee, require the furnishing of such affidavits or other proof as it deems necessary to establish that such transferee is a permitted transferee. if no indication to the contrary is supplied at or within 10 days of the date shares of series b common stock are presented for transfer, the transfer shall be presumed by the corporation to be a transfer to a person other than a permitted transferee. 3. if shares of series b common stock are transferred to a party who was a permitted transferee at the time of such transfer but subsequent thereto no longer qualifies as a permitted transferee, then such transferee's shares of series b common stock shall be automatically converted into series a common stock, effective on the date that such transferee first failed to qualify as a permitted transferee. f. priority of preferred stock all of the common stock is subject to all the powers, rights, privileges, preferences, and priorities of the preferred stock as stated herein and as may be stated and expressed in any resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors providing for the issuance of any additional class or series of preferred stock, pursuant to authority expressly granted to and vested in it by the provisions of this article four. g. liquidation, dissolution or winding up in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (sometimes referred to as "liquidation"), after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the corporation and the preferential amounts to which the holders of any stock ranking prior to the common stock in the distribution of assets shall be entitled upon liquidation, the holders of the issued and outstanding common stock and the holders of any other stock issued and outstanding that ranks on a parity with the common stock shall be entitled to share pro rata in the remaining assets of the corporation according to their respective interests. -8- 89 h. merger or consolidation in case of any consolidation or merger of the corporation as a result of which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive cash, stock, other securities, or other property with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the corporation as an entirety, each holder of a share of any series of common stock shall have the right to convert such share into the same kind and amount of cash, shares or stock, and other securities and properties receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, or conveyance as any other holder of one share of common stock (regardless of series) and shall have no other conversion rights with regard to such share. notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of one share of common stock that does not elect to exercise its right to receive such consideration (the "elective consideration") for such share shall only be entitled to such other consideration therefor (if any) that any other holder of one share of common stock would be entitled to receive if such holder did not elect to receive the elective consideration. the provisions of this subsection h shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, or conveyances. i. fcc approvals for certain actions by holders of series b common stock notwithstanding any provision of this amended and restated certificate of incorporation to the contrary, no holder of series b common stock shall (i) transfer any shares of series b common stock; (ii) convert any shares of series b common stock; or, (iii) be entitled to receive any cash, stock, other securities, or other property with respect to or in exchange for any shares of series b common stock in connection with any merger or consolidation of the corporation or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the corporation as an entirety, unless all necessary approvals ("fcc approvals") of the federal communications commission (the "fcc") as required by the communications act of 1934, as amended from time to time and the rules, regulations and policies promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time (collectively, the "communications act") shall have been obtained or waived. section 2. power to designate preferred stock the board of directors is hereby empowered to authorize, from time to time by resolution or resolutions, the issuance of one or more classes or -9- 90 series of preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, voting or other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, if any, with respect to each such class or series of preferred stock and the number of shares constituting each such class or series, and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such class or series to the extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law, as amended from time to time. any classes or series so designated shall be in addition to the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock designated in sections 3 and 4 below. section 3. series a preferred stock a. designation. 12,500 shares of the preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the corporation are hereby constituted as a series of the preferred stock designated as "series a preferred stock" (the "series a preferred stock"). b. dividends. 1. dividends on series a preferred stock. an annual, cumulative cash dividend of $65 accruing from and after june 1, 1996 shall be declared and paid on each share of the series a preferred stock, payable at the end of each calendar quarter in equal quarterly amounts, provided that at such times (i) there are assets of the corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends and (ii) the payment of such dividends is permitted under the terms of the governing documents for the corporation's then existing borrowing arrangements with third-party lenders. any such dividend that cannot be paid when due shall be paid to the extent permissible at the time that the payment of such dividend becomes permissible. 2. limitation on dividends, repurchases and redemptions. so long as any shares of series a preferred stock shall be outstanding, the corporation shall not declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions on any junior securities (as defined below), whether in cash, property or otherwise (other than dividends or distributions payable in shares of the class or series upon which such dividends or distributions are declared or paid), nor shall the corporation or any of its subsidiaries purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for any consideration or make payment on account of the purchase, redemption, or other retirement of any parity securities (as defined below) or junior securities, nor shall any monies be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of any parity securities or junior securities, unless with -10- 91 respect to all of the foregoing all dividends or other distributions to which the holders of series a preferred stock shall have been entitled, pursuant to subsection b.1 above, shall have been paid or declared and a sum of money has been set apart for the full payment thereof. 3. pro rata payments. in the event that full dividends are not paid or made available to the holders of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and of any parity securities and funds available for a payment of dividends shall be insufficient to permit payment in full to holders of all such stock of the full preferential amounts to which they are then entitled, then the entire amount available for payment of dividends shall be distributed ratably among all such holders of series a preferred stock and of any parity securities in proportion to the full amount to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. c. preference on liquidation. 1. liquidation preference for series a preferred stock. in the event that the corporation shall commence a voluntary case under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under such law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or if a decree or order for relief in respect of the corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on account of any such event the corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, or if the corporation shall otherwise liquidate, dissolve or wind up, no distribution of the assets of the corporation shall be made to the holders of shares of common stock or other junior securities (and no monies shall be set apart for such purpose) unless prior thereto, the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall have received from the assets of the corporation an amount per share equal to the sum of (x) $1,000, plus (y) all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon through the date of -11- 92 distribution, whether or not earned or declared (collectively, the "series a liquidation preference"). 2. pro rata payments. if, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the corporation, the assets of the corporation shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the series a liquidation preference for each share of series a preferred stock then outstanding and the full liquidating payments on all parity securities, then the assets of the corporation remaining after the distribution to holders of any senior securities (as defined below) of the full amounts to which they may be entitled shall be ratably distributed among the holders of series a preferred stock and of any parity securities in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled if all amounts thereon were paid in full. the corporation shall not issue any senior securities without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock issued and outstanding. 3. sale not a liquidation. neither the voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the property or assets of the corporation nor the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the corporation with or into one or more corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary or involuntary, of the corporation. 4. notice of liquidation. written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, stating the payment date or dates when and the place or places where amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to any payment date specified therein, to the holders of record of the series a preferred stock at their respective addresses as shall appear on the records of the corporation. d. voting. 1. general. notwithstanding any provision of this amended restated certificate of incorporation to the contrary, each issued and outstanding share of series a preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the number of votes determined under the following sentence on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of the series a common stock, with such shares of series a preferred stock voting together as a single class with such shares of series a common stock. -12- 93 each share of series a preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the number of votes (rounded up to the next whole number) equal to the number of shares of series a common stock into which one share of series a preferred stock would be convertible under subsection f below as of the record date for the stockholder meeting at which such votes are to be cast. except as set forth in subsection d.2 below or as otherwise provided by applicable law, the shares of series a preferred stock shall not entitle the holders thereof to vote separately as a class. 2. class vote. at any time when shares of series a preferred stock are outstanding, without the approval of the holders representing at least a majority of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be) separately as a class, the corporation shall not amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, this amended and restated certificate of incorporation if such action would alter, change or affect adversely the rights, preferences, privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of, the series a preferred stock. e. redemption 1. redemption price. any redemption of the series a preferred stock pursuant to this subsection e shall be at a price equal to $1,000 per share, plus in each case an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to (and including) the redemption date, whether or not earned or declared (the "series a redemption price"). 2. redemption at corporation's option. at any time after june 11, 2001 (the "first redemption date"), the corporation may, at its option (subject to the other provisions of this subsection e), redeem all, or any portion of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. 3. procedures for redemption. in the event the corporation shall elect to redeem shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to subsection e.2 above, the corporation shall give written notice of such redemption by facsimile, hand delivery, overnight courier, or first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed or transmitted not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed, at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock records of the corporation. each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number -13- 94 of shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the series a redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the series a redemption price; (v) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such series a preferred stock; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue following such redemption date; (vii) that such redemption is mandatory; and, (viii) that dividends accrued to and including the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice. notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the redemption date, unless the corporation shall be in default in the payment of the series a redemption price (including any accrued and unpaid dividends to (and including) the date fixed for redemption, (a) dividends on the shares of the series a preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue; (b) such shares shall be deemed no longer outstanding; and, (c) all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the corporation (except the right to receive from the corporation any moneys payable upon redemption without interest thereon) shall cease. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the average of the closing price for the corporation's series a common stock as reported by nasdaq (or such other principal exchange on which the series a common stock is then listed) for the 10 trading days prior to the date of the redemption notice equals or exceeds the series a conversion price (defined in subsection f.1 below) on such date, any holder that has received such a redemption notice shall have the right to convert the shares of series a preferred stock subject to redemption by complying with the conversion procedures set forth in subsection f below at any time prior to 20 days after the date of receipt of such redemption notice. notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder that has received such a redemption notice shall have the right by providing written notification to the corporation not less than 20 days after receipt of the redemption notice from the corporation, to specify up to three redemption dates, the latest of which shall be january 1 of the second year following the date the corporation specified for redemption, on which the redemption shall occur. such notice shall specify the date or dates on which the redemption shall occur, and, if more than one redemption date is specified, the number of shares to be redeemed on each such date; provided, however, that the total of the number of shares specified by such holder to be redeemed must equal the number of shares originally specified by the corporation for redemption. in the event the holder exercises the right outlined above to specify a -14- 95 different date or dates for redemption than stated in the redemption notice from the corporation, dividends shall continue to accrue and be paid as provided herein until such time as the shares are redeemed. upon surrender in accordance with such notice of the certificates for any such shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the board of directors shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the corporation at the applicable series a redemption price. if fewer than all the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock are to be redeemed, shares to be redeemed shall be selected by the corporation from holders of outstanding shares of series a preferred stock not previously called for redemption in proportion to the respective number of shares held by each holder. if fewer than all the shares represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof. 4. repurchases of series a preferred stock by the corporation. neither the corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall repurchase any outstanding shares of series a preferred stock unless the corporation on the same terms either (i) offers to purchase all of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock or (ii) offers to purchase shares of series a preferred stock from the holders in proportion to the respective number of shares of series a preferred stock held by each holder. in any such repurchase by the corporation, if all shares of series a preferred stock are not being repurchased, then the number of shares of series a preferred stock to be repurchased shall be allocated among all shares of series a preferred stock held by holders that accept the corporation's repurchase offer so that the shares of series a preferred stock are repurchased from such holders in proportion to the respective number of shares of series a preferred stock held by each such holder that accepts the corporation's offer (or in such other proportion as agreed by all such holders who accept the corporation's offer). nothing in this subsection e.4 shall (i) obligate a holder of shares of series a preferred stock to accept the corporation's repurchase offer or (ii) prevent the corporation from redeeming shares of series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of subsections e.1 through e.3 above. -15- 96 f. conversion. 1. right to convert. the holder of each share of series a preferred stock shall have the right at any time, or from time to time, at such holder's option, to convert such share into a number of shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of series a common stock equal to a quotient determined by dividing $1,000 by the "series a conversion price" (defined below), on and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. the "series a conversion price" shall be (i) on or before december 31, 2000, $35; and (ii) during each calendar year after december 31, 2000, the product of 1.1 times the series a conversion price for the immediately preceding calendar year. (for example, during 2001, the series a conversion price shall be $38.50; during 2002 the series a conversion price shall be $42.35; etc.) notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the first redemption date a holder elects to exercise its conversion right under this subsection f.1, and, (i) the corporation has not given written notice of redemption and (ii) the average of the closing price for the corporation's series a common stock as reported by nasdaq (or such other principal exchange on which the series a common stock is then listed) for the 10 trading days prior to the series a conversion date (defined in subsection f.2 below) (the "10 day average price") is less than the series a conversion price on the series a conversion date, then the series a conversion price shall be equal to the 10 day average price. a. if the series a common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise, then and in each such event the holder of each share of series a preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of series a common stock into which such shares of series a preferred stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change. b. if at any time or from time to time there shall be a merger or consolidation of the corporation with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the -16- 97 corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the series a preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or properties of the corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation or sale, to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had converted its shares of series a preferred stock immediately prior to such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this subsection f with respect to the rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock after the merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this subsection f shall be applicable after that event in as nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable. 2. method of conversion. in order to exercise the conversion privilege, the holder of any shares of series a preferred stock to be converted shall present and surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares during usual business hours at any office or agency of the corporation maintained for the transfer of series a preferred stock and shall deliver a written notice of the election of the holder to convert the shares represented by such certificate or any portion thereof specified in such notice. such notice shall also state the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of series a common stock issuable on such conversion shall be registered. if required by the corporation, any certificate for shares surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder of such shares or its duly authorized representative. each conversion of shares of series a preferred stock shall be deemed to have been effected on the date (the "series a conversion date") on which the certificate or certificates representing such shares shall have been surrendered and such notice and any required instruments of transfer shall have been received as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of series a common stock shall be issuable on such conversion shall be, for the purpose of receiving dividends and for all other corporate purposes whatsoever, deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of series a common stock represented thereby on the series a conversion date. -17- 98 3. issuance of certificates upon conversion. as promptly as practicable after the presentation and surrender for conversion, as herein provided, of any certificate for shares of series a preferred stock, the corporation shall issue and deliver at such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, certificates for the number of whole shares of series a common stock issuable upon such conversion and cash for any fractional shares. in case any certificate for shares of series a preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion of only a part of the shares represented thereby, the corporation shall deliver at such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of series a preferred stock represented by such surrendered certificate that are not being converted. the issuance of certificates for shares of series a common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of series a preferred stock by the registered holder thereof shall be made without charge to the converting holder for any tax imposed on the corporation in respect of the issue thereof. the corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable with respect to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the registered holder of the shares being converted, and the corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate unless and until the person requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the corporation the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the corporation that such tax has been paid. 4. payment of dividends on converted shares. upon any conversion of shares of series a preferred stock into shares of series a common stock pursuant hereto, no adjustment with respect to dividends shall be made; only those dividends shall be payable on the shares so converted as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series a preferred stock on a date prior to the series a conversion date with respect to the shares so converted; and only those dividends shall be payable on shares of series a common stock issued upon such conversion as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series a common stock on or after such series a conversion date. 5. reservation of shares. such number of shares of series a common stock as may from time to time be required for such purpose shall be reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. -18- 99 g. shares to be retired. any share of series a preferred stock redeemed, repurchased, converted or otherwise acquired by the corporation shall be retired and canceled and shall upon cancellation be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, subject to reissuance by the board of directors as shares of preferred stock of one or more other series but not as shares of series a preferred stock. h. definitions. as used in this section 3 (and with respect to the definitions of "business day," "common stock" and "person," as also used in section 4 below), the following terms

the corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends and (ii) the payment of such dividends is permitted under the terms of the governing documents for the corporation's then existing borrowing arrangements with third-party lenders. any such dividend that cannot be paid when due shall be paid to the extent permissible at the time that the payment of such dividend becomes permissible. 2. limitation on dividends, repurchases and redemptions. so long as any shares of series b preferred stock shall be outstanding, the corporation shall not declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions on any junior securities (as defined below), whether in cash, property or otherwise (other than dividends or distributions payable in shares of the class or series upon which such dividends or distributions are declared or paid), nor shall the corporation or any of its subsidiaries purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for any consideration or make payment on account of the purchase, redemption, or other retirement of any parity securities or junior securities, nor shall any monies be paid or made -20- 101 available for a sinking fund

payments. in the event that full dividends are not paid or made available to the holders of all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock and of any parity securities and funds available for a payment of dividends shall be insufficient to permit payment in full to holders of all such stock of the full preferential amounts to which they are then entitled, then the entire amount available for payment of dividends shall be distributed ratably among all such holders of series b preferred stock and of any parity securities in proportion to the full amount to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. c. preference on liquidation. 1. liquidation preference for series b preferred stock. in the event that the corporation shall commence a voluntary case under the federal

series b preferred stock shall have received from the assets of the corporation an amount per share equal to the sum of (x) $1,000, plus -21- 102 (y) all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon through

they would otherwise be respectively entitled if all amounts thereon were paid in full. the corporation shall not issue any senior securities without the written consent of the holders of a majority

being repurchased, then the number of shares of series b preferred stock to be repurchased shall be allocated among all shares of series b preferred stock held by holders that accept the corporation's repurchase offer so that the shares of series b preferred stock are repurchased from such holders in proportion to the respective number of shares of series b preferred stock held by each such holder that accepts the corporation's offer (or in such other proportion as agreed by all such holders who accept the corporation's offer). nothing in this subsection e.4 shall (i) obligate a holder of

is then listed or traded) for each of the 10 trading days prior to the conversion date, on and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. a. if the series a common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or

securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of series a common stock into which such shares of series b preferred stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change. b. if at any time or from time to time there shall be a merger or consolidation of the corporation with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the series b preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the series b preferred stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or properties of the corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation or sale, to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had converted its shares of series b preferred stock immediately prior to such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this subsection f with respect to the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock after the merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of

portion thereof specified in such notice. such notice shall also state the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of series a common stock issuable on such conversion shall be registered. if required by the corporation, any certificate for shares surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the corporation, duly executed by the holder of such shares or its duly authorized representative. each conversion of shares of series b preferred stock shall be deemed to have been effected on the date (the "series b conversion date") on which the certificate or certificates representing such shares shall have been surrendered and such notice and any required instruments of transfer shall have been received as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of series a common stock shall be issuable on such conversion shall be, for the purpose of receiving dividends and for all other corporate purposes whatsoever, deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of series a common stock represented thereby on the series b conversion date. 3. issuance of certificates upon conversion. as promptly as practicable after the presentation and surrender for conversion, as herein provided, of any certificate for shares of series b preferred stock, the corporation shall issue and deliver at such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, certificates for the number of whole shares of series a common stock issuable upon such conversion and cash for any fractional shares. in case any certificate for shares of series b preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion of only a part of the shares represented thereby, the corporation shall deliver at such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of series b preferred stock represented by such surrendered certificate that are not being converted. the issuance of certificates for shares of series a common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of series b preferred stock by the registered holder thereof shall be made without charge to the converting holder for any tax imposed on the corporation in respect of the issue thereof. the corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable with respect to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the registered holder of the shares being converted, and the corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate unless and until the -27- 108 person requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the corporation the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the corporation that such tax has been paid. 4. payment of dividends on converted shares. upon any conversion of shares of series b preferred stock into shares of series a common stock pursuant hereto, no adjustment with respect to dividends shall be made; only those dividends shall be payable on the shares so converted as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series b preferred stock on a date prior to the series b conversion date with respect to the shares so converted; and only those dividends shall be payable on shares of series a common stock issued upon such conversion as have been declared and are payable to holders of record of shares of series a common stock on or after such series b conversion date. 5. reservation of shares. such number of shares of series a common stock as may from time to time be required for such purpose shall be reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock. g. shares to be retired. any share of series b preferred stock redeemed, repurchased, converted or otherwise acquired by the corporation shall be retired and canceled and shall upon cancellation be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, subject to reissuance by the board of

(b) the company, within ninety (90) days of the date on which the company receives a demand notice given by holders in accordance with section 2(a) hereof, shall file with the sec, and the company shall thereafter use its best efforts to cause to be declared effective, a registration statement on the appropriate form for the registration and sale, in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution, of the total number of registrable shares specified by the holders in such demand notice (a "demand registration"). (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not have any obligation to effect a demand registration pursuant to this section 2 unless (i) the gross proceeds from the sale of the registrable shares included in the demand registration are expected to be at least $45 million , and (ii) at the date of the demand notice, the average daily trading volume of the common stock for the prior sixty (60) trading days as reported by the national securities exchange or automated interdealer quotation system on which the common stock is so listed or quoted is less than 150,000 shares. (d) the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep each registration statement filed pursuant to this section 2 continuously effective and usable for the resale of the registrable shares covered thereby until the earlier of (i) one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date on which the sec declares such registration statement effective and (ii) until all the registrable shares covered by such registration statement have been sold pursuant to such registration statement. (e) the company shall be entitled to postpone the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the company pursuant to this section 4 120 2, or suspend the use of any effective registration statement under this section 2, for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of ninety (90) days (a "delay period"), if the board of the company determines that in its reasonable judgment and good faith the registration and distribution of the registrable shares covered or to be covered by such registration statement would materially impede, delay or interfere with any pending material financing, acquisition or corporate reorganization or other material corporate development involving the company or any of its subsidiaries or would require premature disclosure thereof and promptly gives the holders written notice of such determination, containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the period of the anticipated delay; provided, however, that (i) the aggregate number of days included in all delay periods during any consecutive 12 months shall not exceed the aggregate of (x) one hundred and eighty (180) days minus (y) the number of days occurring during all hold back periods and interruption periods during such consecutive 12 months and (ii) a period of at least sixty (60) days shall elapse between the termination of any delay period, hold back period or interruption period and the commencement of the immediately succeeding delay period. if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, the holders of registrable shares to be registered shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice from the holders of a majority of the registrable shares that were to be registered to the company within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the notice of postponement or, if earlier, the termination of such delay period (and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration to which the holders of registrable shares are entitled pursuant to this section 2). the time period for which the company is required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement shall be extended by the aggregate number of days of all delay periods, all hold back periods and all interruption periods occurring during such registration and such period and any extension thereof is hereinafter referred to as the "effectiveness period." the company shall not be entitled to initiate a delay period unless it shall (a) to the extent permitted by agreements with other security holders of the company, concurrently prohibit sales by such other security holders under registration statements covering securities held by such other security holders and (b) in accordance with the company's policies from time to time in effect, forbid purchases and sales in the open market by senior executives of the company. (f) the company shall have the right in its sole discretion to include any securities that are not registrable shares ("non-registrable securities") in any registration statement filed pursuant to this section 2; provided, however, that in the event the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advises the company in writing that the total number of non-registrable securities to be included in such offering exceeds the amount that can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying or jeopardizing the success of such offering (including the price per share of the registrable shares to be sold), then the amount of non- registrable securities to be offered for the account of the company shall be reduced to an amount that the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in the offering reasonably determine can be sold in such offering without materially delaying or jeopardizing the success of such offering. 5 121 (g) holders of a majority in number of the registrable shares to be included in a registration statement pursuant to this section 2 may, at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating to such registration, revoke such request by providing a written notice to the company revoking such request. the holders of registrable shares who revoke such request shall reimburse the company for all of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing and processing of the registration statement; provided, however, that, if such revocation was based on the company's failure to comply in any material respect with its obligations hereunder, such reimbursement shall not be required. section 3. piggyback registration. (a) right to piggyback. if at any time during the period commencing on the date of this agreement and ending on the date which is five hundred and forty (540) days after the effective time the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to a public offering of securities of the same type as the registrable shares pursuant to a firm commitment underwritten public offering solely for cash for its own account (other than a registration statement (i) on form s-8 or any successor forms thereto, or (ii) filed solely in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan or employee benefit plan covering officers or directors of the company or its affiliates) or for the account of any holder of securities of the same type as the registrable shares (to the extent that the company has the right to include registrable shares in any registration statement to be filed by the company on behalf of such holder but excluding a demand registration), then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders at least fifteen (15) days before the anticipated filing date. such notice shall offer the holders the opportunity to register such amount of registrable shares as they may request (a "piggyback registration"). subject to section 3(b) hereof, the company shall include in each such piggyback registration all registrable shares with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after notice has been given to the holders. each holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or any portion of the registrable shares of such holder from a piggyback registration at any time prior to the effective date of such piggyback registration; provided, however, that if such withdrawal occurs after the filing of the registration statement with respect to such piggyback registration, the withdrawing holders shall reimburse the company for the portion of the registration expenses payable with respect to the registrable shares so withdrawn. (b) priority on piggyback registrations. the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter of an underwritten public offering to permit the holders to include all such registrable shares on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities, if any, of the company included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company or the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advise the holders in writing that the total amount of securities requested to be included in such piggyback registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying, jeopardizing or otherwise adversely affecting the success of the offering (including the price per share of the securities to be sold), then the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the holders and other holders of securities who have piggyback registration rights with respect thereto shall be reduced (to zero if necessary) pro rata on the 6 122 basis of the number of common stock equivalents requested to be registered by each such holder or holder participating in such offering. (c) right to abandon. nothing in this section 3 shall create any liability on the part of the company to the holders if the company in its sole discretion should decide not to file a registration statement proposed to be filed pursuant to section 3(a) hereof or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that a holder may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance by the company of any notice hereunder or otherwise. section 4. holdback agreement. if (i) the company shall file a registration statement (other than in connection with the registration of securities issuable pursuant to an employee stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or pursuant to a merger, exchange offer or a transaction of the type specified in rule 145(a) under the securities act) with respect to the common stock or similar securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, such securities and (ii) with reasonable prior notice, the company (in the case of a nonunderwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the holders in writing that a public sale or distribution of such registrable shares would materially adversely affect such offering or the managing underwriter or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the company in writing (in which case the company shall notify the holders) that a public sale or distribution of registrable shares would materially adversely impact such offering, then each holder shall, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, refrain from effecting any public sale or distribution of registrable shares during the ten days prior to the effective date of such registration statement and until the earliest of (a) the abandonment of such offering, (b) one hundred and twenty (120) days from the effective date of such registration statement and (c) if such offering is an underwritten offering, the termination in whole or in part of any "hold back" period obtained by the underwriter or underwriters in such offering from the company in connection therewith (each such period, a "hold back period"). section 5. registration procedures. in connection with the registration obligations of the company pursuant to and in accordance with sections 2 and 3 hereof (and subject to sections 2 and 3 hereof), the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of such registrable shares in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the company shall as expeditiously as practicable (but subject to sections 2 and 3 hereof): (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement for the sale of the registrable shares on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate in accordance with such holders' intended method or methods of distribution thereof, subject to section 2(b) hereof, and, subject to the company's right to terminate or abandon a registration pursuant to section 3(c) hereof, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; 7 123 (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments (including post-effective amendments) to such registration statement, and such supplements to the related prospectus, as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the securities act during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition specified by the holders of the registrable shares covered by such registration statement, make generally available earnings statements satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act (provided that the company shall be deemed to have complied with this clause if it has complied with rule 158 under the securities act), and cause the related prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to rule 424 under the securities act; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto (other than reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act), the company shall furnish to the holders of registrable shares covered by such registration statement and their counsel for review and comment, copies of all documents required to be filed; (c) notify the holders of any registrable shares covered by such registration statement promptly and (if requested) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the sec for amendments or supplements to such registration statement or the related prospectus or for additional information regarding such holders, (iii) of the issuance by the sec of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by the company of any notifications with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the registrable shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (v) of the happening of any event that requires the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (d) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any registrable shares for sale in any jurisdiction in the united states; (e) furnish to the holder of any registrable shares covered by such registration statement, each counsel for such holders and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of such registration statement, as declared effective by the sec, and of each post-effective amendment thereto, in each case including financial statements and schedules and all exhibits and reports incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference; and deliver, without charge, such number of copies of the preliminary prospectus, any amended preliminary prospectus, each final prospectus and any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto, as such 8 124 holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable shares of such holder covered by such registration statement in conformity with the requirements of the securities act; (f) prior to any public offering of registrable shares covered by such registration statement, use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such registrable shares for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the holders of such registrable shares shall reasonably request in writing; provided, however, that the company shall in no event be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in any jurisdiction where it is not at the time so qualified or to execute or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction where it has not theretofore done so or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then subject; (g) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraph 5(c)(v) above, prepare a supplement or post- effective amendment to such registration statement or the related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the registrable shares being sold thereunder (including upon the termination of any delay period), such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (h) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all registrable shares covered by such registration statement to be listed on each securities exchange or automated interdealer quotation system, if any, on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed or quoted; (i) on or before the effective date of such registration statement, provide the transfer agent of the company for the registrable shares with printed certificates for the registrable shares covered by such registration statement, which are in a form eligible for deposit with the depository trust company; (j) make available for inspection by any holder of registrable shares included in such registration statement, any underwriter participating in any offering pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such holder or underwriter (collectively, the "inspectors"), all financial and other records and other information, pertinent corporate documents and properties of any of the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the "records"), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibilities; provided, however, that the records that the company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the inspectors in writing are confidential shall not be disclosed to any inspector unless such inspector signs a 9 125 confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the company but in any event permitting disclosure by an inspector if either (i) the disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such registration statement or (ii) the release of such records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction; provided further, however, that (a) any decision regarding the disclosure of information pursuant to subclause (i) shall be made only after consultation with counsel for the applicable inspectors and the company and (b) with respect to any release of records pursuant to subclause (ii), each holder of registrable shares agrees that it shall, promptly after learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court having jurisdiction, give notice to the company so that the company, at the company's expense, may undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of such records; and (k) enter into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such other appropriate and reasonable actions requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable shares being sold in connection therewith (including those reasonably requested by the managing underwriters) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable shares, and in such connection (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain opinions of counsel to the company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriters and counsel to the holders of the registrable shares being sold), addressed to each selling holder of registrable shares covered by such registration statement and each of the underwriters as to the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such counsel and underwriters, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the company or of any business acquired by the company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the registration statement), addressed to each selling holder of registrable shares covered by the registration statement (unless such accountants shall be prohibited from so addressing such letters by applicable standards of the accounting profession) and each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, (iii) if requested and if an underwriting agreement is entered into, provide indemnification provisions and procedures substantially to the effect set forth in section 8 hereof with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said section. the above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting or similar agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. the company may require each holder of registrable shares covered by a registration statement to furnish such information regarding such holder and such holder's intended method of disposition of such registrable shares as it may from time to time reasonably request in writing. if any such information is not furnished within a reasonable period of time 10 126 after receipt of such request, the company may exclude such holder's registrable shares from such registration statement. each holder of registrable shares covered by a registration statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 5(c)(ii), 5(c)(iii), 5(c)(iv) or 5(c)(v) hereof, that such holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of any registrable shares covered by such registration statement or the related prospectus until receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 5(g) hereof, or until such holder is advised in writing (the "advice") by the company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amended or supplemented prospectus or any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference in such prospectus (such period during which disposition is discontinued being an "interruption period") and, if requested by the company, the holder shall deliver to the company (at the expense of the company) all copies then in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable shares at the time of receipt of such request. each holder of registrable shares covered by a registration statement further agrees not to utilize any material other than the applicable current preliminary prospectus or prospectus in connection with the offering of such registrable shares. section 6. registration expenses. whether or not any registration statement is filed or becomes effective, the company shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incident to the company's performance of or compliance with this agreement, including (i) all registration and filing fees, including nasd filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection therewith, (iii) printing expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for registrable shares and of printing prospectuses if the printing of prospectuses is requested by the holders or the managing underwriter, if any), (iv) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (v) fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, (vi) fees and disbursements of all independent certified public accountants of the company (including expenses of any "cold comfort" letters required in connection with this agreement) and all other persons retained by the company in connection with such registration statement, (vii) reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel, other than the company's counsel, selected by holders of a majority of the registrable shares being registered, to represent all such holders, (viii) fees and disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by the issuers or sellers of securities and (ix) all other costs, fees and expenses incident to the company's performance or compliance with this agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees and expenses of any persons retained by any holder, other than one counsel for all such holders, and any discounts, commissions or brokers' fees or fees of similar securities industry professionals and any transfer taxes relating to the disposition of the registrable shares by a holder, will be payable by such holder and the company will have no obligation to pay any such amounts. section 7. underwriting requirements. in the case of any underwritten offering pursuant to either a demand registration or a piggyback registration, the 11 127 company shall select the institution or institutions that shall manage or lead such offering. no holder shall be entitled to participate in an underwritten offering unless and until such holder has entered into an underwriting or other agreement with such institution or institutions for such offering in such form as the company and such institution or institutions shall determine and has completed and executed all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. section 8. indemnification. (a) indemnification by the company. the company shall, without limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable shares whose registrable shares are covered by a registration statement or prospectus, the officers, directors and agents and employees of each of them, each person who controls each such holder (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act) and the officers, directors, agents and employees of each such controlling person, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgment, costs (including, without limitation, costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively, "losses"), as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are based upon information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable to any such holder to the extent that any such losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (i) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the company with copies of the prospectus, such holder failed to send or deliver a copy of the prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale of registrable shares by such holder to the person asserting the claim from which such losses arise and (ii) the prospectus would have corrected in all material respects such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged omission; and provided further, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the prospectus, if (x) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission is corrected in all material respects in an amendment or supplement to the prospectus and (y) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the company with copies of the prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such holder thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented, prior to or concurrently with the sale of registrable shares. (b) indemnification by holder of registrable shares. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder is participating, such holder shall furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with such registration statement or the related prospectus and agrees to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, the company, its directors, officers, agents or employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 12 128 20 of the exchange act) and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or the related prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is based upon any information so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party from which such indemnify is sought (the "indemnifying party") of any claim or of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced by such delay or failure. the indemnifying party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such claim or proceeding, to assume, at the indemnifying party's expense, the defense of any such claim or proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that (i) an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless: (1) the indemnifying party agrees to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the indemnifying party fails promptly to assume the defense of such claim or proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; or (3) the named parties to any proceeding (including impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are inconsistent with those available to the indemnifying party or that a conflict of interest is likely to exist among such indemnified party and any other indemnified parties (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party); and (ii) subject to clause (3) above, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all of the indemnified parties, or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. whether or not such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party, such indemnified party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent. the indemnifying party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 13 129 (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses (other than in accordance with its terms), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provision of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a holder shall not be required to contribute any amount which is in excess of the amount by which the total proceeds received by such holder from the sale of the registrable shares sold by such holder (net of all underwriting discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required by pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 9. reports under the exchange act. the company agrees to: (a) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by the company under the exchange act;
