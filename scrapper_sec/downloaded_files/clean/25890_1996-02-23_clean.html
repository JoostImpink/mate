(whether now owned or hereafter acquired) having crown voting power (as defined below) representing, in the aggregate, less than 3.5% of the total voting power of crown (as defined below); (2) the date the crown board of directors agrees to recommend (or ceases to oppose) the consummation of a specified event (as defined below), or takes certain actions designed to induce or materially facilitate such specified event; (3) the date that voting securities representing 25% of the total voting power of crown have been acquired by any "person" (as defined in the shareholders agreement) or "group" as such term is used in section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act (a "group") other than cgip, its controlled affiliates (as defined below) or any group of which cgip or any such controlled affiliate is a member; (4) the date that crown has entered into an agreement with respect to the merger or consolidation of crown or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of crown, or any tender or exchange offer for voting securities representing 25% or more of the total voting power of crown, after which the surviving 10 company in any such transaction would have a board of directors of which the majority of its members would not be continuing directors (as defined below) (and in addition, in respect of an asset sale, in which the shareholders of crown do not receive capital stock of the successor company), or crown takes material steps to solicit any such transaction; (5) the date that crown materially breaches the provisions of the shareholders agreement regarding representation of cgip on the board of directors of crown (as discussed under "-- board representation" below) and the breach remains uncured for 15 days, or the provisions of the shareholders agreement regarding cgip's registration rights with respect to crown stock and the breach remains uncured for 30 days, after written notice of the breach has been given by cgip to crown (a "designated crown breach"); (6) the date that any cgip designee fails to be elected to the board of directors, unless crown has not taken appropriate action within 30 days thereafter to cause another cgip designee to become a director, or to otherwise adjust the size of the board of directors to preserve the proportionate representation to which cgip is then entitled to under the shareholders agreement; (7) the date that crown breaches the dividend payment requirements of the shareholders agreement (as discussed under "-- dividend policy" below) (if such payment is not excused by the shareholders agreement), unless crown has elected to its board of directors one cgip designee in excess of the number of such cgip designees provided for in the shareholders agreement, in which case crown will have an additional period of one year to cure such dividend payment breach (it being understood that cgip will cause such cgip designee to resign from the board of directors promptly after the earlier of (x) the date of such cure and (y) the date of termination of the standstill period); or (8) the date that crown breaches the debt rating maintenance provisions of the shareholders agreement (as discussed under "-- debt rating" below). notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties have agreed that the standstill period will not terminate if, at the time the standstill period would otherwise have terminated in accordance with clauses (1) through (8) above, cgip is in material breach of provisions of the shareholders agreement regarding the restriction on certain actions by cgip

directors of crown (as discussed under 11 "-- board representation" below), the obligations of cgip with respect to the presence of cgip at all shareholder meetings of crown and the voting of the

securities (as discussed under "-- transfer restrictions on crown common stock and crown preferred stock" below) (each, a "designated shareholder breach"). as used above, "specified event" means any

"voting securities" means, subject to certain limitations set out in the shareholders agreement, (x) any securities entitled, or which may be entitled, to vote generally in the election of directors of crown, (y) any securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable for such securities (whether or not the right to convert, exercise or exchange is subject to the passage of time or contingencies or both) (including the crown preferred stock), or (z) any direct or indirect rights or options to acquire any such securities. "crown voting power" means the voting power in the general election of directors of crown, and shall be calculated for each voting security by reference to the maximum number of votes such voting security is or would be entitled to cast in the general election of directors, and, in the case of convertible (or exercisable or exchangeable) securities, by reference to the maximum number of votes such voting security is entitled to cast in unconverted or converted (or exercised, unexercised, exchanged or unexchanged) status. for purposes of determining crown voting power under the shareholders agreement, a voting security which is convertible into or exchangeable for a voting security will be counted as having 12 the greater of (1) the number of votes to which such voting security is entitled prior to conversion or exchange and (2) the number of votes to which the voting security into which such voting security is convertible or exchangeable is entitled. crown voting power does not include any votes which a person would have upon the non-payment of dividends on the crown preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the crown preferred stock. the term "total voting power" means the total combined crown voting power, on a fully diluted basis, of all the voting securities then outstanding. restriction of certain actions by cgip. during the standstill period, cgip has agreed that none of cgip, any of its controlled affiliates, or any group of which cgip or any such controlled affiliate is a member, will in any manner, directly or indirectly, effect or seek, initiate or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way induce, assist or encourage any other person to effect, seek, offer, initiate or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in any takeover proposal (which is defined in the shareholders agreement to include, among other things, (1) any specified event, (2) any other proposal to take over control of crown or for a merger or other similar transaction involving crown or any of its material subsidiaries, or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner voting securities representing more than 20% of the total voting power of crown or any of its material subsidiaries, a substantial equity interest in any of crown's material subsidiaries or a substantial portion of the assets of crown or any of its material subsidiaries and (3) any request to invite any person to effect any of the actions specified below or any request to challenge the validity of, waive the benefit of, opt out of, or amend any provision of, the shareholder rights plan of crown contemplated by the shareholders agreement or any rights plan approved by the strategic committee of the board of directors or any anti-takeover statutes or other anti-takeover provisions applicable to crown), or any action described in (a) through (c) below, unless in any such case invited in writing to do so by the board of directors of crown as specifically expressed in a resolution adopted by a majority of the continuing directors who are not cgip designees: (a) acquire, offer or propose to acquire, or agree to acquire, whether by purchase, tender or exchange offer, gift or otherwise (any such act, to "acquire"), beneficial ownership of any voting securities or any rights to acquire any voting securities except for (x) the acquisition of voting securities which would not, after giving effect to such acquisition, result in beneficial ownership of voting securities representing crown voting power in excess of 19.95% of the total 13 voting power of crown, (y) pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, rights offering, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction made available to holders of any voting securities generally or (z) upon conversion of the crown preferred stock;

november 13, 1995, between crown cork & seal company, inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania, u.s.a. ("crown"), and compagnie generale d'industrie et de participations, a societe anonyme (registre du commerce et des societes no. b 308 389 519) organized under the laws of the republic of france ("shareholder"). background a. shareholder, directly and through its subsidiaries, is the record and beneficial owner of 26,188,956 shares of common stock, ff10 par value per share (the "common stock") of carnaudmetalbox, a societe anonyme (registre du commerce et des societes no. b 775 721 996) organized under the laws of the republic of france (the "company"). crown and shareholder desire that, as part of a business combination of crown and the company, crown (or a wholly-owned subsidiary of crown) make a public exchange offer with a secondary cash offer as an offre publique d'echange a titre principal et d'achat a titre subsidiaire (jointly, the "offer", which term shall include any subsequent public exchange offer made by crown (or such subsidiary) on the same terms as the original offer or such modified terms as would be permitted pursuant to this agreement in the case of a modification of the terms of the original offer), for all of the outstanding common stock. shareholders of the company will be offered a choice in the offer for each then outstanding share of common stock between (i) 1.065 units (each, a "unit"), each consisting of (x) .75 shares of crown's common stock, $5.00 par value per share (the "crown common stock"), and (y) .25 shares of crown's 4.5% cumulative convertible preferred stock, with a par value per share equal to the average of the market closing price per share of crown common stock for the most recent 20 business days on which trading of crown common stock has occurred prior to the measurement date (in each case, as defined below), the terms of which are set forth in annex 1 hereto and authorized as set forth in annex 2 hereto (the "crown preferred stock"), and (ii) cash in an amount of ff 225 per share of common stock (the "cash election price"). the crown common stock and the crown preferred stock making up each unit will be separately transferrable. the ratio of 1.065 units for each share of common stock, as such ratio shall be adjusted pursuant to the terms of this agreement, is hereinafter referred to as the "exchange ratio". b. in addition to the offer, crown has undertaken, subject to the terms of this agreement, to launch an exchange offer in the united kingdom (the "u.k. exchange offer") which, to the extent permitted by law, shall be on terms identical to the offer (the offer and the u.k. exchange offer are together referred to as the "exchange offers"). c. as of the date hereof, shareholder beneficially owns, directly and through its indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary camebo b.v. ("camebo"), the number of shares of common stock set forth in section a above (such shares of common stock together with any other shares of common stock acquired after the date hereof and prior to the termination hereof, whether arising from exercise of options, receipt of dividends, conversion of convertible securities or otherwise, and as adjusted by any stock split or similar event, being collectively referred to herein as the "shares"). d. as a condition to its willingness to make the offer, crown has asked that shareholder agree, and shareholder has agreed, all as more fully set forth herein and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to (i) validly tender its shares, and cause its subsidiaries to validly tender their shares, in the offer and elect to receive only units and (ii) enter into a shareholders' agreement with crown with respect to shareholder's relationship with crown. a-7 terms in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, crown and shareholder agree as follows: 1. agreement to make offer. (a) agreement to make offer. subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in section 10.1 hereof, crown or a wholly-owned subsidiary of crown shall undertake the offer in accordance with articles 5-1-1 to 5-2-27 of the reglement general of the conseil des bourses de valeurs and all other applicable provisions of french and united states law and regulation for all of the outstanding common stock. the offer shall remain open for the minimum number of days required by applicable french law and regulation. the offer shall provide that the acceptance by crown of common stock tendered in the offer shall be conditioned only upon the number of shares of common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer being at least equal to a majority of the voting power based on the number of shares of outstanding common stock on the date prior to the filing date, assuming loss of all double voting rights with respect to the shares of common stock acquired by crown or its subsidiaries (the "minimum condition"). (b) terms; exchange ratio. (i) the terms of the offer shall provide that all of the outstanding common stock may be tendered by the holder thereof and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer, shall entitle such tendering holder to receive for each share of common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn, at such holder's election, (x) a number of units equal to the exchange ratio as adjusted pursuant to this section 1(b) or (y) the cash election price in cash, in french francs and without interest. (ii) if the average crown common stock price is greater than ff 211.27 per share (the "initial price") but less than ff 232.39 per share (110% of the initial price), then the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward accordingly. if the average crown common stock price is greater than or equal to ff 232.39 per share (110% of the initial price), the exchange ratio will be adjusted as though the average crown common stock price were equal to ff 232.39 (110% of the initial price). (iii) if the average crown common stock price is less than the initial price but greater than ff 190.14 per share (90% of the initial price), then the exchange ratio will be adjusted upward accordingly. if the average crown common stock price is equal to or less than ff 190.14 per share (90% of the initial price), the exchange ratio will be adjusted as though the average crown common stock price were equal to ff 190.14 (90% of the initial price). (iv) in any case where the exchange ratio is to be adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (b), the adjusted exchange ratio will be calculated by applying the following formula (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth): the adjusted exchange ratio equals the exchange ratio multiplied by the fraction of which the numerator is the initial price and the denominator of which is the average crown common stock price. (v) for purposes of this agreement: the "average crown common stock price" shall be the average french franc crown common stock price (as defined below) for the most recent 20 business days on which trading of crown common stock has occurred prior to the measurement date; and the "measurement date" shall be the business day before the filing date. the "french franc crown common stock price", for any particular business day, shall be the product of (x) the market closing price per share of crown common stock, in u.s. dollars, and (y) the noon buying rate for such business day (or if there was no trading in such currencies on such business day, the most recent day on which trading of the french franc and u.s. dollar has occurred). (c) conduct of the offer; amendment; waiver. subject to the applicable securities and takeover laws and the regulations of the sec, cob, cbv, sbf and any other administrative, governmental or regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, crown expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, and regardless of whether or not any of the conditions set forth in sections 10.1 and 10.2 hereof shall have been satisfied or waived by crown, to (i) extend the period a-8 of time during which the offer is open and thereby delay acceptance for payment of, and the payment for, any common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn, and (ii) subject to section 1(d) below, amend the offer (including the exchange ratio and the minimum condition) in any respect by surenchere or otherwise. in any case where the terms of the offer are modified, any such modification shall be effected such that the implied value of the number of units offered in exchange for one share of common stock remains equal to the cash election price per share of common stock under terms of the offer as so modified. subject to the provisions of this agreement, if by the expiration of the offer any or all of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied, crown reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to (i) terminate the offer and return all tendered common stock to tendering shareholders, (ii) extend the offer and, subject to the terms of the offer (including the rights of shareholders to withdraw their common stock), retain the common stock which has been tendered and is not subsequently withdrawn until the termination of the offer, as extended, or (iii) commence another offer. crown shall have no obligation to pay interest on the purchase price of tendered common stock. (d) restrictions on amendment or waiver of offer. without the prior written consent of shareholder, crown will not decrease the cash election price or the exchange ratio as adjusted pursuant to sections 1(b)(ii) or (iii), decrease the number of shares of common stock being sought in the offer, change the form of consideration payable in the offer or make any other change in the terms or conditions of the offer which is adverse to the holders of common stock (including, without limitation, any change that would cause shareholder or camebo to recognize taxable gain or loss in the offer or in any subsequent conversion of the crown preferred stock into crown common stock); provided, that an increase in the value of the consideration offered in the offer shall not be deemed to constitute an adverse change solely because it increases the gain or diminishes the loss that holders of common stock would otherwise be required to recognize for tax purposes irrespective of such increase in consideration. except as provided below with respect to the minimum condition, the parties agree that a waiver by crown of any condition to the offer in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its discretion shall not be deemed to be adverse to any holder of common stock. notwithstanding anything in paragraph (c) above or this paragraph (d) to the contrary, crown shall not reduce or waive the minimum condition. (e) fractional shares. no fraction of a share of crown common stock or crown preferred stock will be issued in the offer, but, in lieu thereof, each holder of common stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of crown common stock or crown preferred stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of crown common stock or crown preferred stock to be received by the holder), as the case may be, will be entitled to receive from crown an amount of cash in french francs (rounded to the nearest whole french franc) equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the average crown common stock price. (f) adjustments to exchange ratio, etc. the exchange ratio, the components of a unit, the cash election price and the other terms of the offer will be adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution to shareholders of securities convertible into crown common stock or crown preferred stock or common stock), recapitalization, or other like change with respect to crown common stock or crown preferred stock or common stock occurring after the date of this agreement and prior to the filing date. (g) the u.k. exchange offer. crown or a wholly-owned subsidiary of crown shall launch the u.k. exchange offer on, or as promptly as practicable after, the commencement date (unless crown shall have determined in its good faith judgment that such u.k. exchange offer is not necessary after consultation with shareholder). the u.k. exchange offer shall be made, to the extent legally permissible, on the same terms as the offer, provided that the cash election price in the u.k. exchange offer shall be payable in french francs or, at crown's option, in pounds sterling (translated from french francs at the exchange rate in effect on the closing date (as published in the dow jones telerate inc. currency cross-rates published in the wall street journal (u.s. edition)). crown shall cause the u.k. exchange offer to be carried out in accordance with all applicable requirements of united kingdom law and regulation. in the event that it is determined that a u.k. exchange offer is not required, all references to the u.k. exchange offer in this agreement shall be null and void. a-9 (h) company options. subject to applicable law and regulation, and subject to the terms of the company's employee stock options, crown shall make an offer to each holder of the company's employee stock options outstanding on the date of this agreement, and each holder of the new options and the 1994 options to the extent issued in accordance with this agreement (the outstanding options, the new options and the 1994 options are collectively referred to as the "outstanding options") in respect of the common stock for which such outstanding options have not been exercised as of the closing date, to settle such holder's options, at the sole discretion of crown, (i) for cash at a price per share of common stock equal to the cash election price to the extent such options are "in the money", provided that crown shall indemnify the holder against all tax claims and liabilities resulting from such settlement, (ii) by issuing options on crown common stock that are exercisable at such price as crown determines not in excess of the then current market price for crown common stock that preserve, to the fullest extent practical, the provisions of such holder's options as to the duration of such options, the conditions for vesting of such options and the conditions for exercise of such options or (iii) by offering a choice to the holder of (i) or (ii), or a combination of (i) and (ii) in a proportion to be agreed between crown and the option holder, provided that in the cases described in this clause (iii) crown shall have no obligation to indemnify a holder who elects cash from any tax claims and liabilities resulting from such settlement. in addition, subject to applicable law and regulation, to the extent any employee or former employee of the company is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from transferring common stock received upon exercise of options, crown shall, on the date such employee or former employee is permitted to transfer such common stock, offer such employee or former employee the right to tender such common stock to crown for units (in an amount determined by applying the exchange ratio as adjusted on the measurement date, and provided crown preferred stock is then outstanding) or cash in an amount equal to the cash election price, in each case on the same basis offered in the offer. subject to compliance with the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit crown with respect to restricting or terminating such options as agreed between crown and the holders of such options. 2. agreement to tender. (a) tender. subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the filing date of the conditions set forth in section 11 hereof, shareholder will validly tender, and will cause camebo to validly tender, and not withdraw all shares beneficially owned by shareholder and camebo (and any other subsidiary of shareholder) pursuant to the offer on or before the second french market day after the commencement date and will irrevocably elect, and cause camebo (and any other subsidiary of shareholder) to irrevocably elect (pursuant to the procedures specified in the offer and described in section 1(b) hereof), to receive only units in consideration for such shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholder agrees that, at the direction of crown, it will elect pursuant to the offer to receive the cash election price in consideration for one share validly tendered and not withdrawn and to receive units in consideration for the remainder of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn. (b) third-party bids. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, shareholder shall at all times prior to expiration of the offer retain the right to withdraw its shares previously tendered into the offer and to tender its shares, and to cause camebo to tender their shares, into a tender offer or exchange offer launched by a third party for all of the outstanding common stock (a "third party bid") provided that (i) the third party bid has a greater value than the value of the offer and crown has not increased the offer, as permitted under sections 1(c) and 1(d) above, to match the third party bid; and (ii) crown is unable to demonstrate to shareholder that, immediately prior to the scheduled expiration of the offer, the minimum condition will be satisfied (assuming the shares are tendered in the offer). 3. voting. at any annual or special, ordinary or extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the company however called, shareholder shall vote the shares against (i) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries or a reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any change in a majority of the a-10 directors or the supervisory board of the company, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by crown; (iv) any material change in the present capitalization of the company (other than (x) relating to the faba transaction, (y) the issuance of new options and the 1994 options in accordance with this agreement and (z) the amendment to the statuts, in each case described in the balo announcement) or any material change in the dividend policy of the company; (v) any action which would cause any of shareholder's representations and warranties to become untrue in any material respect or any condition to the obligations of shareholder or crown to remain unsatisfied; and (vi) any other material change in the company's corporate structure or business, in each case (i) to (vi) to the extent such action or agreement would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the offer or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 4. expiration. this agreement, crown's obligation to make the exchange offers pursuant hereto, and shareholder's obligation to tender its shares and to cause camebo (and any other subsidiary of shareholder) to tender its shares pursuant to the offer, shall terminate on the expiration date. as used herein, the term "expiration date" means the first to occur of (i) the first date on which the offer has been successfully consummated (and the closing date with respect thereto shall have occurred) or has expired without being successfully consummated, and (ii) termination in accordance with section 13. 5. warranties of crown. crown hereby warrants to shareholder as follows: (a) organization and qualification. crown is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. crown is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on crown.

(b) during such time as shareholder is entitled pursuant to section 3.2(a) above to have at least one shareholder designee on the board of directors, shareholder shall also be entitled to have one shareholder designee appointed to serve on each committee of the board of directors, including any special committee, and the company agrees to cause one such shareholder designee to be so appointed. notwithstanding the foregoing, if none of the shareholder designees would be considered "independent" of the company or "disinterested" (i) for purposes of any applicable rule of the nyse, the paris stock exchange, the london stock exchange or any other securities exchange or other self regulating organization (such as the nasd) requiring that members of the audit committee be independent of the company, (ii) for purposes of any law or regulation that requires, in order to obtain or maintain favorable tax, securities, corporate law or other material legal a-4-12 benefits with respect to any plan or arrangement for employee compensation or benefits, that the members of the committee of the board of directors charged with responsibility for such plan or arrangement be "independent" of the company or "disinterested", or (iii) for purposes of any special committee formed in connection with any transaction or potential transaction involving the company and any of shareholder, its controlled affiliates or any group of which shareholder is a member or such other transaction or potential transaction which would involve a conflict of interest on the part of the shareholder designees, then a shareholder designee shall not be required to be appointed to any such committee; provided that, the committees of the board shall be organized such that, to the extent practicable, the only items to be considered by any committee on which no shareholder designee may serve will be those items which prevent the shareholder designee from serving on such committee.

(d) as of the closing date, the board of directors shall consist of no more than eighteen (18) directors and shall be reduced to sixteen (16) directors by no later than immediately after the time of the company's next annual meeting of shareholders. in the event that the size of the board of directors a-4-13 is thereafter increased or decreased, the number of directors shareholder shall be entitled to designate shall be adjusted ratably. in the event the increase in the number of directors was approved by a majority of the shareholder designees serving on the board of directors, any fraction shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. in the event the increase in the number of directors was not approved by a majority of such shareholder designees, any fraction shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. when required by this paragraph, shareholder shall promptly cause the appropriate number of shareholder designees to resign from the board of directors and any committees thereof, or the company shall promptly cause to be elected the appropriate number of shareholder designees to give effect to this paragraph, as the case may be. (e) notwithstanding the provisions of this section 3.2, shareholder shall not be entitled to designate any person to the company's board of directors (or any committee thereof) in the event that the company receives a written opinion of its outside counsel that a shareholder designee would not be qualified under any applicable law, rule or regulation to serve as a director of the company or if the company objects to a shareholder designee because such shareholder designee has engaged in any adverse conduct that would require disclosure under item 7 of schedule 14a (promulgated under the exchange act) or if the board of directors determines in good faith in its reasonable judgment that nomination or election of a shareholder designee would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors, and, in any such event, the shareholder shall withdraw the designation of such proposed shareholder designee and designate a replacement therefor (which replacement shareholder designee shall also be subject to the requirements of this section). the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify the shareholder of any objection to a shareholder designee sufficiently in advance of the date on which proxy materials are mailed by the company in connection with such election of directors to enable the shareholder to propose a replacement shareholder designee in accordance with the terms of this agreement. section 3.3. voting.

(a) if shareholder or any of its controlled affiliates wishes to effect any disposition of preferred shares pursuant to section 4.1(b), section 4.1(c) or section 4.1(d) hereof, shareholder shall give written notice (a "preliminary transfer notice") to the company of such intended disposition, specifying the preferred shares to be subject to disposition and the intended method of disposition (and including, to the extent known, the identity of any prospective purchasers and, in respect of a proposed private sale, the price at which, and the material terms upon which (including the identity of any prospective purchaser), such sale is proposed to be made); provided that any request for registration of subject stock constituting preferred shares shall be deemed a preliminary transfer notice with respect to the registrable securities requested to be registered. the preliminary transfer notice shall be given not less than twenty (20) nor more than thirty (30) trading days in advance of the transfer notice. if shareholder determines that it wishes to proceed with its proposed underwritten offering, rule 144 sale or private sale, shareholder shall deliver to the company a written notice to that effect containing the same scope of information as in the preliminary transfer notice (the "transfer notice") within the time period prescribed in the preceding sentence. if the company wishes to purchase the preferred shares specified in the transfer notice, then in the case of a proposed private sale within five (5) trading days, and in the case of other such dispositions within twenty (20) trading days, following receipt of the transfer notice, the company shall deliver a written notice (an "exercise notice") to shareholder indicating that the company wishes to exercise its rights hereunder to purchase such number of such preferred shares as designated in the exercise notice, a date for the closing of such purchase, which shall not be more than ten (10) trading days after delivery of such exercise notice (subject to extension as provided herein), and a place for the closing of such purchase (a "section 4.2 closing"). upon delivery of an exercise notice, a binding agreement shall be deemed to exist providing for the purchase by the company of the preferred shares to which such exercise notice relates, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 4.2; provided that, other than with respect to a private sale, the company may rescind its a-4-20 exercise notice (in which event it will not have obligation to purchase such preferred shares) at any time within five (5) trading days following any determination of the value of any untraded securities pursuant to section 4.2(b)(ii) hereof. (b) the purchase price for any such preferred shares (the "purchase price") shall be determined as set forth below. (i) with respect to preferred shares proposed to be sold pursuant to a private sale, the purchase price per share of such preferred shares shall equal the price contained in the transfer notice. with respect to preferred shares proposed to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering or a rule 144 sale, the purchase price per share of such preferred shares shall equal the average closing price per share of the preferred shares during the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the company's delivery of the exercise notice. the closing price (the "market price") for each such day shall be the last sale price regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the nyse, or, if the preferred shares are not listed or admitted to trading on such exchange, on the principal national or international securities exchange on which the preferred shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if the preferred shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national or international securities exchange but are designated as national market system securities by the national association of securities dealers, inc. ("nasd"), the last sale price, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, in either case as reported on the nasd automated quotation/national market system, or if the preferred shares are not so designated as national market system securities, the average of the highest reported bid and lowest reported asked prices as furnished by the nasd or similar organization if the nasd is no longer reporting such information. (ii) if the preferred shares are not publicly traded as contemplated pursuant to clause (i) above, the value of the preferred shares shall be determined by two united states nationally recognized investment banking firms, one firm to be selected by each of shareholder and the company, or in the event such firms are unable to agree, by a third united states nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by such firms. a-4-21 shareholder and the company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such determination of value to be made within ten trading days following the company's delivery of the applicable exercise notice. in connection with any determination of fair market value pursuant to this section 4.2(b), each party will bear the fees and expenses of the investment banking firm selected by it and the parties will bear equally the fees and expenses of any third investment banking firm. (c) at any section 4.2 closing, the company shall pay to shareholder (or its designees) the aggregate purchase price for the preferred shares by wire transfer of immediately available funds in united states dollars, and shareholder shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the company such preferred shares, with documentation satisfactory to the company evidencing the transfer of such preferred shares, in form acceptable for transfer on the company's books. (d) if the company does not exercise its right to purchase preferred shares specified in a transfer notice, or if the company exercises its right to rescind as described in the proviso to the last sentence of section 4.2 (a) hereof, then the party giving such transfer notice shall be free to effect the disposition of such preferred shares, subject to section 4.1 hereof (other than the restrictions contained therein relating to the company's purchase rights under this section 4.2); provided that, in the case of a disposition pursuant to an underwritten offering, shareholder may effect such disposition in accordance with the provisions of this agreement in an underwritten offering that is consummated at any time within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the last date on which the company's exercise notice could have been timely delivered; provided, further that in the case of a disposition pursuant to a rule 144 sale, shareholder may effect such disposition in accordance with the provisions of this agreement in a rule 144 sale within thirty (30) days following the last date on which the company's exercise notice could have been timely delivered. (e) the obligations of the parties to effect any section 4.2 closing shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) all waiting periods, if any, applicable to the transactions occurring at such section 4.2 closing under the hart-scott- rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, shall have expired or been terminated and (ii) no statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, injunction or other order shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction which prohibits such transactions or makes such transactions illegal. if, as of any date on which a section 4.2 closing is scheduled to a-4-22 occur, the foregoing conditions relating thereto have not been satisfied, then such section 4.2 closing shall occur as promptly as practicable following such satisfaction, and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the satisfaction of such conditions; provided that if the foregoing conditions relating to any section 4.2 closing are not satisfied within one hundred twenty (120) days following the delivery of the applicable exercise notice, then shareholder or the company may terminate the agreement deemed to exist upon delivery of the applicable exercise notice. section 4.3 company's right to purchase common shares. (a) if shareholder or any of its controlled affiliates wishes to effect any disposition of shares of common stock pursuant to section 4.1(b), section 4.1(c) or section 4.1(d), shareholder will so notify the company. such notice shall indicate whether such disposition will occur pursuant to section 4.1(b), 4.1(c) or 4.1(d). in the event shareholder has obtained a bona fide offer for such shares at a price higher than the market price on the business day immediately preceding such notice, the notice shall indicate such higher price, together with the identity of the proposed purchaser and any other material terms in the case of a private sale. the company shall have the right to purchase all (but not less than all) of the shares of common stock at the higher of the market price on the business day immediately preceding such notice or the higher price specified in such notice, if any. as promptly as practicable, and in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such notice from shareholder, the company shall advise shareholder if it will purchase such shares of common stock. if the company elects not to purchase such shares of common stock or if the company fails to agree to purchase such shares of common stock on the terms provided herein within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of notice, then shareholder shall be free to undertake the disposition of such shares. in case the notice shall have specified that such disposition would occur pursuant to section 4.1(b), then shareholder may effect such disposition in accordance with the provisions of this agreement in an underwritten offering that is consummated at any time within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the company of such notice. in case the notice shall have specified that such disposition would occur pursuant to section 4.1(c) or 4.1(d), then shareholder shall have twenty (20) business days to offer and sell such common stock. in any case, any such sale may occur at a price above or below the market price, but in the case of a private sale such sale may not occur at a price less than the price at which such shares were offered to the company if the price at which such shares were so offered exceeded the market price on the date of such offer to the company. a-4-23 (b) if the company agrees to purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to clause (a) above, the provisions of section 4.2(c) and section 4.2(e) shall apply to such purchase as if it were a section 4.2 closing. section 4.4 assignment of rights. the company may assign any of its rights under this article 4 to any person without the consent of shareholder, provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the company of any of its obligations pursuant to this article 4. in the event that the company elects to exercise a right to purchase any voting securities under this article 4, the company may specify another person as the company's designee to purchase the voting securities. section 4.5 required dispositions. (a) the company acknowledges that shareholder's voting power relative to total voting power may from time to time exceed 19.95% solely as a result of the company's repurchase of its own outstanding voting securities or reclassifications by the company of voting securities. if, as a result of such company repurchases or reclassifications, shareholder shall at any time during the standstill period beneficially own voting securities having voting power that is more than 23.45% of total voting power (the "cap"), then, if and to the extent requested by the company by written notice to shareholder, shareholder shall, within eighteen (18) months after such request, dispose of or cause its controlled affiliates to dispose of (a "required disposition") such number of shares of voting securities pursuant to article 4 hereof as shall be necessary to reduce shareholder's beneficial ownership of total voting power to no more than the cap. article 5 registration rights section 5.1 registration upon request. at any time after june 30, 1996, shareholder shall have the right to make written demand upon the company, on not more than eight (8) separate occasions (subject to the provisions of this section 5.1), to register under the securities act, the common stock, the preferred shares, the shares of common stock received by shareholder pursuant to the conversion of the preferred shares and any additional preferred shares or shares of common stock which shareholder may have acquired after the date hereof to the extent such additional shares were acquired by shareholder in compliance with the terms of this agreement (the shares subject to such demand hereunder being referred to as the "subject stock"), and the company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause such shares to be registered under the securities act as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit the sale thereof; provided, however, a-4-24 that each such demand shall cover at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of subject stock constituting preferred shares or one million (1,000,000) shares of subject stock constituting shares of common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and similar events after the date hereof). in connection therewith, the company shall, as expeditiously as possible, prepare and file with the commission, a registration statement under the securities act to effect such registration, and use reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for at least ninety (90) days. shareholder agrees to provide all such information and materials and to take all such action as may be reasonably required in order to permit the company to comply with all applicable requirements of the securities act and the commission and to obtain any desired acceleration of the effective date of such registration statement. if the offering to be registered is to be underwritten, the managing underwriter shall be selected by shareholder and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company, and shareholder and such underwriter shall enter into an underwriting agreement containing customary terms and conditions. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company (i) shall not be obligated to prepare or file more than one such registration statement during any twelve (12) month period, (ii) shall be entitled to postpone for a reasonable period of time (but in no event more than one hundred-twenty (120) days) the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the company if (x) the company is, at such time, conducting or about to conduct an underwritten public offering of securities and is advised by its managing underwriter or underwriters that such offering would, in its or their opinion, be adversely affected by the registration so requested, or (y) the company determines in good faith that the registration and distribution of the shares of subject stock would interfere with any existing or proposed financing, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other transaction of a similar type involving the company. in the event of such postponement, shareholder shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the company within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice of postponement (and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of registrations to which shareholder is entitled pursuant to this section 5.1). section 5.2 incidental registration rights. if the company proposes to register any of the preferred shares or common stock for sale under the securities act (other than (i) pursuant to section 5.1 hereof, (ii) securities to be issued pursuant to a stock option or other employee benefit or similar plan, or (iii) securities proposed to be issued in exchange for securities or assets of, or in connection with a merger or consolidation with, a-4-25 another corporation) the company shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to the date such registration statement is filed with the commission, give written notice to shareholder of the company's intention to effect such registration. if, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, shareholder submits a written request to the company specifying the amount of subject stock that it proposes to sell or otherwise dispose of in accordance with this section 5.2, the company shall use reasonable efforts to include the shares specified in shareholder's request in such registration. if the offering pursuant to such registration statement is to be made by or through underwriters, the managing underwriters shall be chosen by the company in its sole discretion, and the company, shareholder and such underwriter shall execute an underwriting agreement in customary form. if the managing underwriter determines in good faith and advises shareholder that the inclusion in the registration statement of all the subject stock proposed to be included would interfere with the successful marketing of all securities proposed to be registered, then shareholder shall agree to downward adjustment in the number of shares of subject stock to be included in such underwriting sufficient to alleviate fully such marketing concern (provided that if securities are being offered for the account of persons other than the company (other than pursuant to demand registration rights), then the proportion by which the amount of securities intended to be offered for the account of shareholder is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which the amount of such securities intended to be offered for the account of such other person is reduced). if shareholder has been permitted to participate in a proposed offering pursuant to this section 5.2, the company thereafter may determine either not to file a registration statement relating thereto, or to withdraw such registration statement, or otherwise not to consummate such offering, without any liability hereunder. in connection with any offering of shares of subject stock registered pursuant to section 5.1 or 5.2 hereof, shareholder shall comply with all other terms of this agreement (including section 4.1(b), and in connection with section 4.1(b), shareholder shall use all reasonable efforts to secure the agreement of the underwriters, in connection with any underwritten offering of its subject stock, to comply therewith). section 5.3 registration mechanics. in connection with any offering of shares of subject stock registered pursuant to section 5.1 or 5.2 hereof, the company shall (i) furnish to shareholder such number of copies of any prospectus (including preliminary and summary prospectuses) and conformed copies of the registration statement (including amendments or supplements thereto and, in each case, all exhibits) and such other documents as it may reasonably request, but only while the company shall be required under the provisions hereof to cause the registration statement to remain current; (ii) (x) use reasonable efforts to register or a-4-26 qualify the subject stock covered by such registration statement under such blue sky or other state securities laws for offer and sale as shareholder shall reasonably request and (y) keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the registration statement remains in effect; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation under the laws of any jurisdiction in which it shall not then be qualified or to file any general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction in which such a consent has not been previously filed or subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be subject to tax but for the requirements of this section 5.3; (iii) use reasonable efforts to cause all shares of subject stock covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other federal or state government agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the company to enable shareholder to consummate the disposition of such shares of subject stock; (iv) notify shareholder any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and (subject to the good faith determination of the board of directors as to whether to cease all sales under such registration statement), at the request of shareholder prepare and furnish to it a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (v) otherwise use reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission; (vi) use reasonable efforts to list, if required by the rules of the applicable securities exchange or, if securities of the same class are then so listed, the subject stock covered by such registration statement on the nyse, the paris stock exchange and on any other principal securities exchange on which such class of voting securities is then listed; and (vii) before filing any registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to shareholder and its counsel copies of such documents and permit shareholder and its counsel to review and comment on such documents. upon any registration becoming effective pursuant to section 5.1, the company shall use reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement current for a period of ninety (90) days or such shorter period as shall be necessary to effect the distribution of the subject stock. a-4-27 shareholder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in clause (iv) of this section 5.3, it will forthwith discontinue its disposition of subject stock pursuant to the registration statement relating to such subject stock until its receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by clause (iv) of this section 5.3 and, if so directed by the company, will deliver to the company all copies then in its possession of the prospectus relating to such subject stock current at the time of receipt of such notice. if shareholder's disposition of subject stock is discontinued pursuant to the foregoing sentence, unless the company thereafter extends the effectiveness of the registration statement to permit dispositions of subject stock by shareholder at least thirty (30) consecutive days and for an aggregate of ninety (90) days, whether or not consecutive, the registration statement shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of registrations to which shareholder is entitled pursuant to section 5.1. section 5.4 expenses. shareholder shall pay all agent fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions related to shares of subject stock being sold by shareholder and the fees and disbursements of its counsel and accountants and the company shall pay all fees and disbursements of its counsel and accountants in connection with any registration pursuant to this article 5; provided that all fees and disbursements in connection with any registration (excluding any withdrawn registration request) pursuant to this article 5 in excess of the first four (4) actual such registrations shall be borne by the shareholder. all other fees and expenses in connection with any registration statement (including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, all printing costs, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws) shall (i) in the case of a registration pursuant to section 5.1, be borne solely by shareholder and (ii) in the case of a registration pursuant to section 5.2, be shared pro rata based upon the respective market values of the securities to be sold by the company, shareholder and any other holders participating in such offering. section 5.5 indemnification and contribution. in the case of any offering registered pursuant to this article 5, the company agrees to indemnify and hold shareholder, each underwriter, if any, of the subject stock under such registration and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and any directors and officers of the foregoing, harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (including reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in the investigation and defense thereof) to which they or any of them may become subject under the securities act or otherwise (collectively "losses"), insofar as any a-4-28 such losses shall arise out of or shall be based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement relating to the sale of such subject stock, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the prospectus relating to the sale of such subject stock, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this section 5.5 shall not apply to such losses which shall arise out of or shall be based upon any such untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, which shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by shareholder or any such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the registration statement or prospectus contained in the registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement therein. in the case of each offering registered pursuant to this article 5, shareholder and each underwriter, if any, participating therein shall agree, substantially in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in the preceding paragraph, severally to indemnify and hold harmless the company and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and the directors and officers of the company, with respect to any statement in or omission from such registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement (as amended or as supplemented, if amended or supplemented as aforesaid) if such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by shareholder or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto. each party indemnified under this section 5.5 shall, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any claim against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof. the failure of any indemnified party to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability in respect of such action which it may have to such indemnified party on account of the indemnity contained in this section 5.5, unless (and only to the extent) the indemnifying party was prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall such failure relieve the indemnifying party from any other a-4-29 liability which it may have to such indemnified party. in case any action in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may desire, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 5.5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation (unless such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party in which event the indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with retaining separate legal counsel). no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. if the indemnification provided for in this section 5.5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless from any losses in respect of which this section 5.5 would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions provided herein), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the offering to which such contribution relates as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, each party's relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, and the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses if the a-4-30 indemnification provided for in this section 5.5 was available to such party. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5.5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 5.6. assignment of registration rights. shareholder may, in connection with any transfer of its voting securities permitted by this agreement, assign its rights under this article 5 to any controlled affiliate without the company's consent and, in the case of an assignment to a person which is not a controlled affiliate, with the company's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided that if such assignment is to a person other than a controlled affiliate, any demand registration requested by such assignee pursuant to section 5.1 hereof shall be for a minimum of one million (1,000,000) preferred shares or two million (2,000,000) shares of common stock, respectively). section 5.7. termination. the registration rights granted to shareholder pursuant to this article 5 shall terminate immediately at such time as shareholder owns voting securities having a voting power of less than three and one half percent (3.5%) of the total voting power or if there is a designated shareholder breach. article 6 standstill provisions regarding the shareholder and certain entities section 6.1 restriction of certain actions by the company. during the standstill period (it being understood that for this purpose the standstill period shall terminate only pursuant to section 2.1(i)), the company agrees that none of the company, any of its controlled affiliates or any group of which the company or any such controlled affiliate is a member (it being understood that, for the purposes of this section 6.1, the company is not (x) a member of any group of which shareholder is a member or (y) a controlled affiliate of shareholder or mw) will in any manner, directly or indirectly, effect or seek, initiate or propose (whether publicly or otherwise), to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way induce, assist or encourage any other person to a-4-31 effect, seek, offer, initiate or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, any unsolicited tender or exchange offer commenced by a person for voting securities representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of shareholder, mw or any of their material subsidiaries, or an unsolicited proxy or consent solicitation by any such person in order to replace at least a majority of the directors of shareholder, mw or such subsidiary, (ii) any other proposal to take over control of shareholder or mw or for a merger, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or similar transaction involving shareholder, mw or any of their material subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner voting securities representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of shareholder, mw or any of their material subsidiaries, a substantial equity interest in any of shareholder's or mw's material subsidiaries or a substantial portion of the assets of shareholder or mw or any of their respective material subsidiaries, (iii) any request to invite any person to effect any of the actions specified in this section 6.1 or any request to challenge the validity of, waive the benefit of, opt out of, or amend any provision of, any shareholder rights plan of shareholder or mw or any anti- takeover statutes or other anti-takeover provisions applicable to shareholder or mw, or (iv) a proposal having similar effect, or (v) including without limitation any action described in (a) through (c) below, unless in any such case invited in writing to do so by the board of directors of shareholder or mw, as the case may be, as specifically expressed in a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors: (a) acquire, offer or propose to acquire, or agree to acquire, whether by purchase, tender or exchange offer, gift or otherwise, beneficial ownership of any voting securities or any rights to acquire (whether currently, upon lapse of time, following the satisfaction of any conditions, upon the occurrence of any event or any confirmation of the foregoing) any voting securities of shareholder or mw, as the case may be (it being understood that, if the company beneficially owns or acquires any voting securities of shareholder or mw, as the case may be, in violation of this agreement, such voting securities shall immediately be disposed of to persons who are not affiliates thereof; provided, however, that shareholder may also pursue any other available remedies to which it may be entitled as a result of such violation. (b) form, join, participate in or encourage the formation of, any group with respect to any voting securities of shareholder or mw or deposit any voting securities into a voting trust or subject any such voting securities to a voting agreement or any other arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting thereof; or a-4-32 (c) request shareholder or mw (or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents) to amend or waive any provision of this agreement (including this paragraph). section 6.2 termination. the provisions of section 6.1 shall terminate on the earlier of (a) the date of a designated shareholder breach and (b) the date on which the standstill period terminates pursuant to section 2.1(i). notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of section 6.1 shall not
