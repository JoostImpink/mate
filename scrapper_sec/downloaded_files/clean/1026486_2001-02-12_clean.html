date. any such new warrant certificate executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of the company, whether or not this warrant certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall be at any time enforceable by anyone. section 8. rights of the holder. prior to the exercise of the warrants, the holder shall not be entitled to the rights of a stockholder of the company by reason of the holder's ownership of the warrants. section 9. antidilution provisions. the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 9. if at any time or from time to time, after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell, or is, in accordance with clauses (1) through (5) of this section 9, deemed to have issued or sold, any shares ("additional common shares") of its common stock (including, without limitation, pursuant to the gotel closing), then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue or sale, to a price equal to the quotient obtained by dividing: (a) the product of (x) such exercise price multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance by (b) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to clauses (1) through (5) of this section 9) immediately after such issuance of the additional common shares. no adjustment of the exercise price, however, shall be made in an amount less than $0.01 per share, and any such lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment which together with any adjustments so carried forward shall amount to $0.01 per share or more. the warrant shares number shall also be subject to adjustment if at any time or from time to time, after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell additional common shares. in such event, the warrant shares number in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be increased, concurrently with such issue or sale, to equal the sum (rounded up to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying: (a) 5% and (b) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding (including any shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to clauses (1) through (5) of this section 9) immediately after such issuance of the additional common shares. for purposes of calculating any adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to this section 9, any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of any options (as defined below) or the conversion of any convertible securities (as defined below) shall be deemed to be 7 outstanding, other then currently outstanding employee stock options that have an exercise price greater than $5.00 per share of common stock ("excluded stock options"). for purposes of this section 9, but without duplication, the following clauses (1) to (6) shall also be applicable: (1) issuance of rights or options. in case at any time the company shall in any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any option or warrant for the purchase of, common stock or any stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (such rights or options being herein called "options" and such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein called "convertible securities") whether or not such options or the right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issued upon the exercise of such options shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting of such options and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding and the exercise price shall be adjusted as provided above in this section 9 as if such shares of common stock or convertible securities were deemed outstanding. except as otherwise provided in clause (3), no adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such options or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (2) issuance of convertible securities. in case the company shall in any manner issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of the issue or sale of such convertible securities and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding and the exercise price shall be adjusted as provided above in this section 9 as if such shares of common stock or convertible securities were deemed outstanding, provided that (a) except as otherwise provided in clause (3) below, no adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and (b) if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any option to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the exercise price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 9, no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (3) change in option price. if after the date hereof, the exercise price provided for in any excluded stock option is reduced at any time to less than $5.00 per share (in each case other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), whether by a decrease in such exercise price or by increasing the number of shares of common stock for which such options may be exercised, the exercise price in effect at the time of such reduction shall forthwith be readjusted to the exercise price which would have been in effect at 8 such time had such options provided for such reduced exercise price at the date of original issuance. (4) stock dividends. in case the company shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon any stock of the company payable in common stock, options or convertible securities, any common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration and the exercise price then in effect immediately prior to such dividend declaration or distribution shall be reduced as if the company had subdivided its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares as provided in clause (5) of this section 9. (5) subdivision or combination of stock. in case the company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares or shall declare or pay a dividend on its outstanding shares of common stock payable in shares of common stock, as applicable, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. (6) record date. in case the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or convertible securities, or (ii) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. section 10. provision in case of reorganization or reclassification. if any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the company shall be effected in such a way (including, without limitation, by way of consolidation or merger) that holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or assets with respect to or in exchange for common stock then, as a condition of such reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provisions (in form satisfactory to the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding warrants) shall be made whereby each holder of a warrant shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the share or shares of common stock of the company immediately theretofore purchasable upon the exercise of such warrant, such shares of stock, securities, cash or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the share or shares of common stock immediately theretofore so purchasable under this warrant had such reorganization or reclassification not taken place and in any such case appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of such holder to the end that the provisions hereof (including without limitation provisions for adjustments of the exercise price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities, cash or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise (including an immediate adjustment, by reason of such reorganization or 9 reclassification, of the exercise price to the value per share of common stock reflected by the terms of such reorganization or reclassification if the value so reflected is less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification). in the event of a merger or consolidation of the company as a result of which a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation are issuable to holders of the common stock of the company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be adjusted in the same manner as though there were a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company. in the case of any merger or consolidation of the company with or into another person, the person formed by such consolidation or resulting from such merger or consolidation, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the holder simultaneously therewith a new warrant certificate, satisfactory in form and substance to the holder, together with such other documents as the holder may reasonably request, entitling the holder thereof to receive upon exercise of the warrants before the expiration date the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and the company may not effect any such merger or consolidation unless and until the foregoing has been complied with. such new warrants shall have the same basic other terms and conditions as the warrants evidenced hereby and shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such written instrument, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in section 9 and this section 10. if the holders of the warrants may elect the kind or amount of shares of stock, other securities and assets receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease, then for the purpose of this section 10 the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon any such reorganization or reclassification (including any merger or consolidation) shall be deemed to be the election made by the holder, which specification shall be made by the holder by the later of (a) 10 business days after the holder is provided with a final version of all information required by law or regulation to be furnished to holders of warrants concerning such election, or if no such information is required, 10 business days after the company notified the holders of all material facts concerning such election and (b) the last time at which holders of warrants are otherwise permitted to make their election. section 11. no dilution or impairment. if any event shall occur as to which the provisions of section 9 or 10 hereof are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment would adversely affect the purchase rights represented by the warrants in a way that is contrary to the manifest and essential intent and principles of sections 9 and 10 hereof, then, in each such case, the company shall appoint an independent appraiser, which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the manifest and essential intent and principles established in sections 9 and 10 hereof, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the purchase rights represented by this warrant certificate. upon receipt of such opinion, the company will promptly provide notice thereof accompanied by a copy thereof to the holder and shall make the adjustments described therein. section 12. taxes on issue or transfer of warrant shares. the company shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issuance of shares of warrant shares on the exercise of this warrant. 10 section 13. notice of adjustment of exercise price or warrant shares number. within 10 business days following the end of each calendar quarter in which the exercise price or warrant shares number is adjusted as herein provided (and at such other times as a holder may from time to time request), the company shall promptly file at the warrant office a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants (who may be the regular accountants employed by the company) setting forth the exercise price and warrant shares number after such adjustment and setting forth a statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the manner of computing the same. within 10 business days following the end of each calendar quarter and at such other times as a holder may from time to time request, the company shall give notice to the holders, at their respective addresses as set forth in the warrant register, of all such adjustments since the prior notification to the holders and since the date hereof. section 14. notice regarding dividends, subscription rights, reclassifications and dissolutions. in case: (a) the company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on any shares of common stock; or (b) the company shall authorize the granting to the holders of its shares of common stock or other warrant shares of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any other rights; or (c) of any reclassification of the shares of common stock or other warrant shares, or of any consolidation, merger or share exchange to which the company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the company is required, or of the conveyance, sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company; or (e) the company or any subsidiary of the company shall commence a tender offer for all or a portion of the company's outstanding shares of common stock or other warrant shares (or shall amend any such tender offer); then the company shall provide to the holder, and shall cause to be filed at the warrant office, at least 20 days (or 10 days in any case specified in clause (a) or (b) above) prior to the applicable record, expiration or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights, options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of or record shares of common stock or other warrant shares to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights, options or warrants are to be determined, (y) the date on which the right to make tenders under such tender offer expires or (z) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record shares of common stock 11 or other warrant shares shall be entitled to exchange such shares or warrant shares for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. section 15. maintenance of office or agency; other. warrant certificates may be presented or

to idt at a price of $0.417 per share of common stock. whereas, the company and the investor have entered into a investment agreement, dated as of february 7, 2001, pursuant to which (i) the investor has agreed to purchase 6,302,005 shares of common stock and the company has agreed to sell to the investor such shares of common stock, subject to the conditions set forth in the investment agreement, and (ii) the investor has agreed to acquire warrants to purchase up to 3,389,249 additional shares of common stock (subject to adjustments as provided in such warrants) and the company has agreed to grant the investor warrants to purchase such shares of common stock, subject to the conditions set forth in such warrants; and whereas, it is a condition to the consummation of the investment agreement that the company and investor enter into this agreement. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: section 1. definitions. (a) for the purposes of this agreement: "act" means the securities act of 1933, as amended. "affiliate" means, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the first such person. "closing" and "closing date" mean the date of the closing, as such term is defined in the investment agreement. "holder" means a holder of registrable securities or, unless the context otherwise requires, warrants to purchase warrant shares, as the term is defined in the investment agreement. "person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization, government or agency or political subdivision thereof, or other entity. "register," "registered" and "registration" refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement in compliance with the act, and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement. "registrable securities" means the initial shares, shares and warrant shares, as the terms are defined in the investment agreement, and all shares of common stock the investor and its affiliates currently beneficially own, provided, however, that such shares or warrant shares shall cease to be registrable securities when and to the extent that (i) the shares and warrant shares have been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the act, (ii) the investor or its affiliates no longer hold any of the shares or warrant shares, (iii) all of the shares and warrant shares have become eligible for resale by the investor or its affiliates within any three-month period pursuant to rule 144 under the act (or any similar provision then in force) or (iv) such shares or warrant shares have ceased to be outstanding. (b) capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this agreement have the meaning ascribed to them in the investment agreement. section 2. registration rights. 2.1. (a) registration upon demand. (i) at any time after the closing date, one or more holders that in the aggregate beneficially own at least 20% of the registrable securities may make a demand that the company effect the registration of all or part of such holders' registrable securities (a "demand registration"). upon receipt of a valid request for a demand registration, the company shall promptly, and in any event no later than 15 days after such receipt, notify all other holders of the making of such demand and shall use its reasonable efforts to register under the act as expeditiously as may be practicable the registrable securities which holders have requested the company to register in accordance with this section 2.1(a)(i). notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall only be required to effect a registration if the number of registrable securities that the company shall have been requested to register shall, in the aggregate, represent at least 20% of the registrable securities then held by all holders. the holders shall together have the right to two demand registrations pursuant to this section 2.1(a)(i). no other securityholder of the company shall be permitted to include any of its securities in a registration statement pursuant to this section 2.1(a)(i) unless the investor or its affiliates consent to such inclusion prior to the filing of the registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (a)(i), the holders shall not make a demand registration during the 180-day period following the date hereof, when a registration statement on form s-1 is in effect which covers the registrable securities and has been approved in writing by the investor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. (ii) notwithstanding section 2.1(a)(i) hereof, and in addition to the rights granted under section 2.1(a)(i) hereof, at any time the company is or becomes eligible to register its securities on form s-3 (or any successor form), one or more 2 holders that in the aggregate beneficially own at least 20% of the registrable securities may make a demand that the company effect the registration of all or part of such holders' registrable securities (an "s-3 demand registration"). upon receipt of a valid request for an s-3 demand registration, the company shall promptly, in and any event no later than 15 days after such receipt, notify all other holders of the making of such demand and shall use its reasonable efforts to register under the act as expeditiously as may be practicable the registrable securities which holders have requested the company to register in accordance with this section 2.1(a)(ii). notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be required to effect any registration if the number of registrable securities that the company shall have been requested to register shall, in the aggregate, represent at least 20% of the registrable securities then held by all holders. the holders shall together have the right to three s-3 demand registrations pursuant to this section 2.1(a)(ii). no other securityholder of the company shall be permitted to include any of its securities in a registration statement pursuant to this section 2.1(a)(ii) unless the investor or its affiliates consent to such inclusion prior to the filing of the registration statement. (b) effective registration statement. a registration requested pursuant to section 2.1(a) hereof shall not be deemed to have been effected (i) if a registration statement with respect thereto has not been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission ("sec"), (ii) if after it has become effective and prior to the date ninety (90) days after the effective date, such registration is materially interfered with by any stop order, injunction or similar order or requirement of the sec or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the fault of any of the holders, or (iii) the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of a holder to perform its obligations under such underwriting agreement. (c) piggyback registration. if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the act with respect to an offering of its equity securities for its own account or for the account of another person or entity, including, without limitations, for the account of gotel investments ltd. or any of its affiliates (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 (or any substitute forms that may be adopted from time to time by the sec)), the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders at the address set forth in the share register of the company as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event less than 7 business days before the anticipated filing date), undertaking to provide each holder the opportunity to register on the same terms and conditions such amount of registrable securities as such holder may request (a "piggyback registration"). each holder will have 5 business days after receipt of any such notice to notify the company as to whether it wishes to participate in a piggyback registration (which notice shall not be deemed to be a request for a demand registration). if the registration statement is filed on behalf of a person or entity other than the company, the company shall include the registrable securities that the holders wish to sell in the registration statement. if the company or the person or entity for 3 whose account such offering is being made shall determine in its sole discretion not to register or to delay the proposed offering, the company may, at its election, provide written notice of such determination to the holders and (i) in the case of a determination not to effect the proposed offering, shall thereupon be relieved of the obligation to register such registrable securities in connection therewith and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay a proposed offering, shall thereupon be permitted to delay registering such registrable securities for the same period as the delay in respect of the proposed offering. if the registrable securities requested to be included in the piggyback registration by any holder differ from the type of securities proposed to be registered by the company and the managing underwriter for such offering advises the company that due to such differences the inclusion of such registrable securities would cause a material adverse effect on the price of the offering (a "material adverse effect"), then (x) the number of such holders' registrable securities to be included in the piggyback registration shall be reduced to an amount which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would eliminate such material adverse effect or (y) if no such reduction would, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, eliminate such material adverse effect, then the company shall have the right to exclude all such registrable securities from such piggyback registration, provided, that there are not included and offered for the account of any other person in such piggyback registration any other securities that differ from the type of securities proposed to be registered. any partial reduction in number of registrable securities of any holder to be included in the piggyback registration pursuant to clause (x) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be effected pro rata based on the ratio which such holder's requested securities bears to the total number of securities requested to be included in such piggyback registration by all persons or entities other than the company who have the contractual right to request that their securities be included in such registration statement and who have requested that their securities be included. 2.2. blackout periods for holders. if the board of directors of the company determines in good faith that the registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2.1(a) hereof (or the use of a registration statement or related prospectus) would be materially detrimental to the company or its shareholders because such filing would require disclosure of material non-public information, and therefore the board of directors determines that it is in the company's best interest to defer the filing of the registration statement, and promptly gives the holders written notice of such determination in the form of a certificate signed by an executive officer of the company following their request to register any registrable securities pursuant to section 2.1(a), the company shall be entitled to postpone the filing of the registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the company pursuant to section 2.1(a) hereof for a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 60 days (a "demand blackout period") after the date of such request, provided that the company's exercise of its rights under this section 2.2(i) shall not result in demand blackout periods for more than 180 days in any 365 day period, (ii) shall not result in demand blackout periods that are separated by less than 45 4 days and (iii) shall only be effective when and for so long as the officers and directors of the company and other holders, if any, of registration rights with respect to the company's securities are similarly restricted from buying or selling securities of the company and/or exercising their registration rights, as applicable. the company shall promptly notify each holder of the expiration or earlier termination of any demand blackout period. 2.3. obligations of the company. whenever the company is required to effect the registration of any registrable securities under this section 2, the company shall, at its expense and as expeditiously as may be practicable: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, use reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective for not less than 120 days, unless all registrable securities included therein are earlier sold. (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of applicable law with respect to the disposition of all of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement. (c) use its best efforts to qualify such registrable securities (i) for listing on the nasdaq national market or listing on the new york stock exchange, inc. or (ii) if neither such quotation system or exchange is available for quotation or listing, for listing on a national securities exchange selected by a majority in interest of the holders of the registrable securities being registered. (d) furnish to the holders of registrable securities registering such securities such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus (in the event of an underwritten offering), in conformity with the requirements of applicable law, and such other documents as each such holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of registrable securities owned by it. (e) use reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under state blue sky laws in any u.s. jurisdictions in which such registration and qualification is reasonably requested by any holder; provided, that the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdictions.
