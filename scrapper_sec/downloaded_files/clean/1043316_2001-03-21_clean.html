change"). 3.11. no undisclosed events or circumstances. except as set forth on the disclosure schedule, no material event or circumstance has occurred or exists with respect to the company or its businesses, properties, prospects, operations or financial condition, of which, under applicable law, rule or regulation, public disclosure is reasonably likely to be required in a subsequent form,

company's sec reports, there is no action, suit, proceeding or claim or governmental inquiry pending or, to the best knowledge of the company, threatened against or involving the company or otherwise

conducted. except as set forth in the disclosure schedule, to the knowledge of the company: (a) all patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights held by the company are valid, enforceable and

the use, operation or enjoyment of any material tangible or intangible asset or real property of the company (a) accurately processes date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing and sequencing) from, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations, to the extent that other systems properly exchange date/time data with the company's systems and (b) will not be adversely affected by the advent of the year 2000 or 2001, the advent of the twenty-first century or the transition from the twentieth century through the year 2000 and into the twenty-first century (collectively, items (a) and (b) are referred to herein as "year 2000 compliant"). to the company's knowledge after reasonable inquiry, no system that is material to the business, finances, or operations of the company receives data from or communicates with any component or system external to itself (whether or not such external component or system is the company's or any third party's) that is not itself year 2000 compliant excepting the parts of the external component or system within which noncompliance will have no effect on the data or communications sent to the company, nor on the systems of the company. all licenses for the use of any system-related software, hardware, databases or embedded controls under the company's control are certified by the manufacturer to be year 2000 compliant and to contain the capabilities required to enable them to be year 2000 compliant within the company's computer systems (hardware and software), or the licenses permit the company or a third party to make all modifications, bypasses, de-bugging, work-arounds, repairs, replacements, conversions or corrections necessary to permit the systems to operate compatibly, in conformance with their respective specifications, and to be year 2000 compliant. except as disclosed in the sec reports, the company has no reason to believe that it may incur material expenses or suffer a material adverse change arising from or relating to the failure of any of its systems to be year 2000 compliant. 3.15. material contracts. all material contracts, arrangements, plans, agreements, leases, licenses, franchises, permits, indentures, authorizations, instruments and other commitments to which the company is a party and which are material to its business (a) have been disclosed in the sec reports to the extent required in accordance with the rules of the sec and (b) are valid and in full force and effect. the company has not, nor, to the knowledge of the company, has any other party thereto, breached any provisions of, nor is in default under the terms thereof, except for such breaches and defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect. 3.16. registration rights. the company is presently not under any obligation to file any registration statement under the securities act relating to any securities of the company or to have any securities of the company included in any registration statement filed or to be filed with the sec. 3.17. full disclosure. no information contained in this agreement, the other transaction documents, or any written statement furnished by or on behalf of the company pursuant to the terms of this agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which made. 4. representations and warranties of the purchaser. as an inducement to the company to sell the shares, each purchaser, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to the company that: 4.1. authorization. such purchaser has full power and authority to enter into this agreement and the other transaction documents. this agreement and the other transaction documents each constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of such purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy laws and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity. 4.2. purchase entirely for own account. this agreement is made with such purchaser in reliance upon such purchaser's representation to the company, which by such purchaser's execution of this agreement, such purchaser hereby confirms, that the shares to be acquired by such purchaser will be acquired for investment for the purchaser's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof in violation of the act, and such purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same in violation of the act. by executing this agreement, each purchaser further represents that such purchaser does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participation to such person or to any third person, with respect to any of the shares. 4.3. disclosure of information. such purchaser has had an opportunity to discuss the company's business, management, financial affairs and the terms and conditions of the offering of the shares with the company's management and has

describe the aspects of the company's business which it believes to be material. the foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the company in section 3 of this agreement or the right of such purchaser to rely thereon. 4.4. restricted stock. such purchaser understands that the issuance of the shares has not been, and will not be, registered under the act, by

representations as expressed herein. such purchaser understands that the shares are "restricted securities" under applicable u.s. federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, each purchaser must hold the shares indefinitely unless their resale is registered with the sec and qualified by applicable state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available. such purchaser acknowledges that, except as set forth in the investor rights agreement, the company has no obligation to register or qualify the resale of the shares. such purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the shares, and on requirements relating to the company which are outside of such purchaser's control, and which (except as provided in the investor rights agreement) the company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy. 4.5. legends. such purchaser understands that each certificate evidencing any of the shares will bear one or all of the following legends: (a) "the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933 (the "act"), and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to , or in connection with, the sale or distribution thereof in violation of the act. no such sale or distribution may be effected without an effective registration statement related thereto or an opinion of counsel in a form satisfactory to the company that such registration is not required under the act." (b) any legend required by the blue sky laws of any state to the extent such laws are applicable to the shares represented by the certificate so legended. (c) a legend referring to the applicability of this agreement and providing that the holder may obtain a copy hereof free of charge at the principal offices of the company. 4.6. accredited investor. such purchaser is an accredited investor as defined in rule 501(a) of regulation d promulgated under the act. 5. conditions to the obligations of the purchasers. the obligations of each of the purchasers under this agreement in connection with each closing are subject to the fulfillment, or the waiver by such purchaser, of the conditions set forth in this section 5 on or before the respective closing date. 5.1. accuracy of representations and warranties. each representation and warranty of the company contained in this agreement shall be true in all material respects on and as of the respective closing date with the same effect as though such representation and warranty had been made on and as of that date. 5.2. performance of obligations. the company shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all agreements and conditions contained in this agreement required to be performed or complied with by the company prior to or at the respective closing. 5.3. no material adverse change. there shall have been no material adverse change since the date hereof. 5.4. certificate of designation.

substantially in the form attached hereto as exhibit d. 5.6. opinion of counsel. the purchasers shall have received an opinion from gray cary ware & freidenrich llp, counsel to the company, dated as

company's systems and (b) will not be adversely affected by the advent of the year 2000 or 2001, the advent of the twenty-first century or the transition from the twentieth century through the year 2000 and into the twenty-first century (collectively, items (a) and (b) are referred to herein as "year 2000 compliant"). to the company's knowledge after reasonable inquiry, no system that is

the company's or any third party's) that is not itself year 2000 compliant excepting the parts of the external component or system within which noncompliance will have no effect on the data or

certified by the manufacturer to be year 2000 compliant and to contain the capabilities required to enable them to be year 2000 compliant within the company's computer systems (hardware and software),

operate compatibly, in conformance with their respective specifications, and to be year 2000 compliant. except as disclosed in the sec reports, the company has no reason to believe that it may incur material expenses or suffer a material adverse change arising from or relating to the failure of any of its systems to be year 2000 compliant. 2.15. material contracts. all material contracts, arrangements, plans, agreements, leases, licenses, franchises, permits, indentures, authorizations, instruments and other commitments to which the company is a party and which are material to its business (a) have been disclosed in the sec reports to the extent required in accordance with the rules of the sec and (b) are valid and in full force and effect. the company has not, nor, to the knowledge of the company, has any other party thereto, breached any provisions of, nor is in default under the terms thereof, except for such breaches and defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect. 2.16. registration rights. other than as provided in the investor rights agreement, the company is presently not under any obligation to file any registration statement under the securities act relating to any securities of the company or to have any securities of the company included in any registration statement filed or to be filed with the sec. 2.17. full disclosure. no information contained in this agreement, the other transaction documents, or any written statement furnished by or on behalf of the company pursuant to the terms of this

purchaser's representation to the company, which by such purchaser's execution of this agreement, such purchaser hereby confirms, that the shares to be acquired by such purchaser will be acquired for investment for the purchaser's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof in violation of the act, and such purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same in violation of the act. by executing this agreement, each purchaser further represents that such purchaser does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participation to such person or to any third person, with respect to any of the shares. 3.3. disclosure of information. such purchaser has had an opportunity to discuss the company's business, management, financial affairs and the terms and conditions of the offering of the

the company to such purchaser, were intended to describe the aspects of the company's business which it believes to be material. the foregoing, however, does not limit or modify the representations and warranties of the company in section 2 of this agreement or the right of such purchaser to rely thereon. 3.4. restricted stock. such purchaser understands that the issuance of the shares has not

state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, each purchaser must hold the shares indefinitely unless their resale is registered with the sec and qualified by applicable state authorities,

requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the shares, and on requirements relating to the company which are outside of such purchaser's control, and which (except as provided in the investor rights agreement) the company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy. 3.5. legends. such purchaser understands that each certificate

effective registration statement related thereto or an opinion of counsel in a form satisfactory to the company that such registration is not required under the act."
