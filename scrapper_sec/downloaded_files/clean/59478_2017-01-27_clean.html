and of lilly to cause merger sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the offer is subject to the condition that the number of shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in satisfaction of such guarantee), together with any shares beneficially owned by lilly or any wholly-owned subsidiary of lilly, equals a majority of the issued and outstanding shares (assuming the exercise, conversion or exchange of all outstanding warrants, stock options and other obligations, securities or instruments of the issuer convertible or exchangeable into, or rights of the issuer exercisable for, shares and the issuance of all shares that the issuer is obligated to issue with respect thereto) as of one minute after 11:59 pm, new york city time, on the date that is 20 business days following the commencement of the offer. the consummation of the offer is also conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or termination of the applicable premerger waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 and other customary conditions. as soon as practicable following the consummation of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions set forth in the merger

consummate the merger. upon the consummation of the merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;), each share will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the offer price (the &#147;merger consideration&#148;), without interest and subject to any required tax withholding. each issuer restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective and each issuer stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and has an exercise price that is less than the merger consideration

shares beneficially owned by them as of the date of the tender agreement or acquired by them after such date (collectively, the &#147;subject shares&#148;) no later than ten business days after the
