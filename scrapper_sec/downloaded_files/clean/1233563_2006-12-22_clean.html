madison avenue 16th floor new york, new york 10022 attn: mr. philip a. falcone confidential information, standstill and nondisclosure agreement --------------------------- gentlemen: this letter agreement relates to discussions involving appaloosa management l.p. and its affiliates ("appaloosa") and harbinger capital partners master fund i, ltd. and its affiliates ("harbinger") (collectively, "you" or "your", it being understood that, unless otherwise determined by delphi corporation, harbinger will communicate with delphi only through appaloosa) involving delphi corporation ("delphi"), a debtor and debtor-in-possession in chapter 11 cases (the "chapter 11 cases") in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york (the "bankruptcy court") concerning possible negotiated business arrangements between you and the company (defined below). in connection with your interest in and review of certain matters relating to delphi and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together with their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and other representatives, the "company"), the company may furnish to you certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information pertaining to the company which is reasonably necessary in order for you to evaluate a transaction (as defined below) and which the company reasonably determines is not competitively sensitive or legally privileged (such information is anticipated to include the financial presentations generally provided on a regular basis to the company's statutory committees and/or their advisors relating to the company's transformation plan which are reasonably necessary in order for you to evaluate a transaction). such information, in whole or in part, whether written or oral, together with any analyses, summaries, compilations, studies, forecasts, abstracts or documents prepared during the review of the company by you or your representatives (as defined below) which contain, are based upon or otherwise reflect such information, is hereinafter referred to as the "evaluation material." the term "evaluation material" does not include any information which you demonstrate: (a) previously was available to you on a non-confidential basis or by virtue of your becoming a member, if ever, of an official committee in the chapter 11 cases (provided, however, that any information made available to you in your capacity as a member of a statutory committee shall be kept confidential as may be required pursuant to agreements between such statutory committee and the company and any applicable duties and obligations you may have as a member of such committee); (b) was obtained from a third person which, insofar as you know, following reasonable inquiry, is not subject to any prohibition against disclosure; or (c) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by of you or any of your representatives in violation of this agreement. you will use the evaluation material solely for the purpose of: (1) considering a possible negotiated business arrangement in our mutual interest involving the company in the chapter 11 cases (such business arrangement, the "transaction"), and (2) to the extent such transaction is acceptable to the company, implementation of such transaction, and you will not use the evaluation material for any other business or competitive purpose. except as required by law, rule or regulation, you will keep the evaluation material strictly confidential and will not disclose the evaluation material to any person or entity (including any official or unofficial committee in the chapter 11 cases), except that you may disclose the evaluation material or portions thereof to those of your directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, financial institutions, attorneys, advisors and accountants (collectively, "representatives") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating on your behalf a transaction and who also execute an acknowledgment wherein they agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this agreement as if they were parties hereto. without the prior written consent of the company, neither you nor your representatives will disclose to any person or entity (including any official or unofficial committee in the chapter 11 cases) the fact that the evaluation material has been made available or that discussions between the parties concerning a transaction are taking place or any term, condition or other fact relating to such business arrangement (except as required by law, rule or regulation and subject to any applicable fiduciary duties as a committee member). you will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by you or any of your representatives. prior to the earlier of (i) february 15, 2007, (ii) the date on which the company files a plan of reorganization in the chapter 11 cases (a "plan of reorganization") in which any party in interest in the chapter 11 cases is afforded an opportunity to participate, including, without limitation, an opportunity to participate in a rights offering for the equity of the delphi following emergence from the chapter 11 cases but the holders of delphi equity are not afforded such opportunity, (iii) any date selected by the company in its discretion following either the filing by you of a pleading in the chapter 11 cases or the taking by you of a public position which respect to a matter relating to the chapter 11 cases which in either case the company believes is in opposition to, or inconsistent with, a position the company has taken or expects to take in the chapter 11 cases, and (iv) the fifth business day following notice by you that the company has not delivered to you previously-requested information (other than information the company reasonably determines is competitively sensitive or legally privileged) described in such notice unless either such information is not reasonably necessary in order for you to evaluate a transaction or prior, to such fifth business day, the company delivers to you such information (such earlier date, the "release date"), unless otherwise agreed to by the company in writing, you agree, in your individual capacity and not as a committee member, if ever applicable, to engage (along with your representatives) in discussions and negotiate exclusively with the company and its legal and financial advisors with respect to a transaction. in addition, you hereby withdraw the letter to the members of the board of directors of delphi, dated march 15, 2006 (the "march 15 letter"). you will file an amendment to your schedule 13d disclosing this agreement and related matters (including that you have withdrawn the march 15 letter). you hereby represent that you have, and will have at all times after the execution of this agreement and prior to the release date, a "net long position" (as defined below) with respect to the company. at the company's request you agree promptly to provide the company with reasonable information which supports the initial representation in the prior sentence and your continued compliance with the prior sentence and the next sentence. in addition, prior to the release date, you will not sell, dispose of or otherwise transfer any equity or debt securities, equity or fixed income related credit derivatives or other instruments (including put equivalent and call equivalent instruments) issued by, guaranteed by or relating to the company. with respect to the company, a "net long position" means that, on an aggregate basis with respect to all equity or debt securities, equity or fixed income related credit derivatives or other instruments (including put equivalent and call equivalent instruments) issued by, guaranteed by or relating to the company, your portfolio of such securities, derivatives and other instruments would be reasonably likely to gain in value if an event occurred which would be reasonably likely to cause the credit quality of the company to improve. in the event that you or any of your representatives are legally required (by deposition, interrogatories, requests for documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process) to disclose any of the evaluation material, or if you or any of your representatives are legally required (by deposition, interrogatories, requests for documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process) to disclose the fact that the evaluation material has been made available or that discussions between the parties are taking place or any other fact relating to a transaction, you will provide to the extent practicable, the company with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the company may (a) seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or (b) in its sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this agreement. if a protective order or other remedy is not obtained within a reasonable period of time, or the company waives compliance with the terms of this agreement, you or your representatives, as applicable, will disclose only that which you or your representatives are legally required to disclose or which is necessary to avoid sanction for contempt of court and you or your representatives, as applicable, will exercise commercially reasonable efforts (which efforts will consist of at least the efforts you undertake in connection with ensuring the confidential treatment of your non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information) to ensure confidential treatment of (x) the evaluation material, (y) the fact that the evaluation material has been made available or that discussions between the parties are taking place, and (z) any other fact you are prohibited from disclosing pursuant to this agreement. if we do not proceed with a transaction, or if the company so requests, you will promptly return to the company all copies (including originals) of the evaluation material in your possession or in the possession of your representatives, and you will promptly destroy all evaluation material which constitutes copies (including originals) of any analyses, studies, abstracts or other documents prepared by you or your representatives or for your or your representatives' use, and any such destruction shall be certified in writing to us by a duly authorized representative of yours. notwithstanding the return or destruction of evaluation material, you and your representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations of confidentiality hereunder for the period commencing on the date hereof through the first anniversary of the date of the consummation of a plan of reorganization. you understand and agree that except as set forth in written definitive agreements in connection with a transaction, the company has not made or is not making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the evaluation material, and nor will the company or its affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, attorneys, advisors or accountants have any liability to you or any other person or entity relating to or resulting from the use of the evaluation material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. for the period commencing on the date hereof through the release date (unless the company is determined by a final order of the bankruptcy court to have failed to perform in all material respects all of its obligations hereunder), (a) you will not seek, and will cause each of your affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, knowingly seek, or solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce a third party to seek, or support a third party that may seek or is seeking to shorten or terminate the company's exclusive periods (the "exclusive periods") to propose and/or solicit a plan of reorganization; provided, however, that if you become a member of an official committee in the chapter 11 cases, then in your capacity as a member of such a committee, you may participate in committee discussions, committee meetings and committee votes with respect to the foregoing matters consistent with your fiduciary duties as a member of such committee and (b) you will not take, and will cause each of your affiliates not to take, directly or indirectly, any action with respect to the matters described in the march 15 letter. until the later of the release date and the date upon which you are no longer in possession of material, non-public information about the company (unless the company is determined by a final order of the bankruptcy court to have failed to perform in all material respects all of its obligations hereunder), without the prior written consent of the company, you will not, and will cause each of your affiliates and representatives (in their capacity as such) not to, singly or as part of a group, in any manner, directly or indirectly: (i) participate in any solicitation of proxies or become a participant in any election contest with respect to the company, (ii) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934) with respect to delphi's common stock, and (iii) sell, dispose of or otherwise transfer any equity securities of the company ("equity securities"), any debt securities of the company ("debt securities"), or assets of or claims against the company, or any rights to acquire any equity securities, debt securities, or assets of or claims against the company. in addition, nothing in this letter agreement results in or will result in a modification, amendment, waiver of any provision in the (i) the final order under 11 usc sections 105, 362 and 541 fed. r. bankr. p. 3001 dated january 6, 2006 (a) establishing notification procedures applicable to substantial holders of claims and equity securities and (b) establishing notification and hearing procedures for trading in claims and equity securities, (ii) the letter agreements, dated november 22, 2005 and january 9, 2006, between the company and palomino fund, (iii) the letter agreements, dated december 5, 2005 and january 9, 2006 between the company and appaloosa investment partnership i, and (iv) the letter agreements, both dated january 9, 2006, between the company and appaloosa management lp. you agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives and that, in addition to all other remedies, the company will be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this agreement. in the event of litigation relating to this agreement, each party shall pay its own expenses. you acknowledge and agree that the company is free to terminate discussions and negotiations with you at any time after the release date and for any reason (provided, however, that the company will not be limited in any way by the terms of this letter agreement in allocating, prioritizing and directing its resources and personnel, including its employees, agents and representatives, to discussions and negotiations with other parties in connection with the chapter 11 cases or other matter) and unless and until a written definitive agreement concerning a transaction has been executed and approved by the bankruptcy court, neither the company nor any of our affiliates or any of our or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, attorneys, advisors or accountants will have any liability to you with respect to any business arrangement, whether by virtue of this agreement, any other written or oral expression with respect to any transaction or otherwise. you acknowledge that you and your representatives may receive material non-public information in connection with your evaluation of any transaction and you are aware (and you will so advise your representatives) that the united states securities laws impose restrictions on trading in securities when in possession of such information. the company understands that you would prefer not to be in possession of material non-public information at the time a plan of reorganization becomes effective. in this regard, the company will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid providing you with information that the company expects is likely to be material non-public information as of the effective date of such a plan of reorganization and you shall follow appropriate procedures to screen information the company provides to you to avoid being in possession or having knowledge of material non-public information as of such date. if, however, you believe that you are in possession of material non-public information at the time a plan of reorganization becomes effective, you may request the company to make appropriate public disclosure such that the information would no longer be non-public, and the company will make such public disclosure if the company reasonably determines that such public disclosure would be in the best interests of the company and its constituents. if information subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other ground on which production of such information should not be made is nevertheless inadvertently produced by the company to you or your representatives, such production shall in no way prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of, or estoppel as to, any claim of privilege, work product or other ground for withholding production to which the company would otherwise be entitled. if a claim of inadvertent production is made pursuant to this paragraph with respect to information then in the custody of you or your representatives, then you or your representatives, as the case may be, shall, upon request, promptly return to the company that material (including all copies thereof) as to which the claim of inadvertent production has been made, and you and your representatives shall not further use such information for any purpose. appaloosa and harbinger are acting independently and not in concert with respect to this agreement and nothing in this agreement shall be construed to suggest that appaloosa and harbinger are in any manner acting together with respect to the company or any transaction. this agreement is solely for the benefit of the company and its respective successors and assigns. the rights of the company under this agreement may be assigned in whole or in part to any purchaser of the company or any substantial part thereof, which purchaser shall be entitled to enforce this agreement to the same extent and in the same manner as the company is entitled to enforce this agreement. no failure or delay by the company in the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof. this agreement can only be modified or waived in writing.

("amlp") and harbinger capital partners master fund i, ltd. ("hcp") in connection with any potential restructuring, acquisition or other transaction (a "transaction") involving delphi corporation (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, "delphi"). this letter agreement (the "agreement") confirms the terms of our engagement. on the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement, ubs will provide amlp and hcp with such financial and market related advice and assistance as reasonably requested by amlp and hcp and reasonably agreed to by ubs, which may include (i) assisting amlp and hcp in analyzing and valuing delphi (including assisting

(iii) assisting amlp and hcp in reviewing and analyzing financing alternatives for any proposed transaction; and (iv) determining whether ubs is prepared to provide any committed financing (as defined

one of the lead bookrunners (with ubs named on the left) with respect to any debt or equity financing (including, without limitation, any bank or bond financing, broadly distributed equity or bond

on information provided by delphi and other parties to any proposed transaction and on information available from generally recognized public sources in performing the services contemplated by this agreement without having assumed responsibility for independently verifying the same, (b) does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of such information and such other information and (c) will not make an appraisal of any assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of a potential transaction party, amlp, hcp or delphi. 5. ubs' services hereunder may be terminated by amlp (or hcp as to itself) or ubs upon 30 days prior written notice without liability or continuing obligation of amlp (or hcp as to itself) or ubs except that (i) ubs' right to receive the break-up fee (as set forth in section 9) shall survive only if amlp (or hcp as to itself) terminates ubs' services, (ii) expenses (as set forth in section 9) incurred by ubs as a result of services rendered prior to the date of the termination shall become immediately payable in full, and (iii) sections 3, 5, 7, 8 (last sentence only), 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination. 6. ubs may, at its own expense, place customary tombstone announcements or advertisements in financial newspapers and journals describing its services hereunder, which such announcements or advertisements shall be subject to the approval of amlp and hcp, which shall not unreasonably be denied. 7. amlp and hcp acknowledge and agree that ubs has been retained to act solely as an advisor to amlp and hcp, and not as an advisor to any other person, and amlp's and hcp's engagement of ubs is not intended to confer rights upon any person (including partners, shareholders, employees or creditors of amlp and/or hcp) not a party hereto as against ubs or its affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, successors, or assigns. ubs shall act as an independent contractor under this agreement, and not in any other capacity including as a fiduciary, and any duties arising out of its engagement shall be owed solely to amlp and hcp. 8. ubs ag (the parent of ubs) and its subsidiaries, branches and affiliates (the "ubs group") are involved in a wide range of commercial banking, investment banking and other activities (including investment management, corporate finance and securities issuing, trading and research) from which conflicting interests, or duties, may arise. information which is held elsewhere within ubs or within the ubs group but of which none of the individuals in the investment banking department of ubs involved in providing the services contemplated by this engagement actually has (or without breach of internal procedures can properly obtain) knowledge, will not for any purpose be taken into account in determining ubs' responsibilities to amlp and hcp under this engagement. neither ubs nor any other part of the ubs group will have any duty to disclose to amlp or hcp or utilize for amlp's or hcp's benefit any non-public information acquired in the course of providing services to any other person, engaging in any transaction (on its own account or otherwise) or otherwise carrying on its business. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, ubs and its affiliates may trade the securities of delphi and potential transaction parties for its own account and for the accounts of customers, and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, ubs will not act as a financial advisor, underwriter or sponsor with respect to any transaction (other than an amlp sponsored transaction or a transaction supported by amlp) without the express written consent of amlp. 9. whether or not any transaction is consummated, and in addition to any fees payable to ubs, amlp and hcp will, subject to section 11, reimburse ubs upon its request from time to time for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by ubs in entering into and performing services pursuant to this agreement, including the reasonable documented fees, disbursements and other charges of its outside legal counsel; provided, however, that amlp and hcp shall not be responsible for reimbursing legal expense in excess of $50,000 unless agreed (not to be unreasonably withheld) in writing by amlp and hcp subsequent to the date of this agreement. it is understood that ubs anticipates that, (i) if ubs is requested to testify in the delphi bankruptcy proceedings with respect to a proposed transaction, ubs will engage outside counsel to assist, and (ii) ubs would need to engage outside counsel to prepare documentation and conduct due diligence in connection with any proposed financing in connection with an amlp sponsored transaction (it being understood that, if delphi proceeds with such financing with ubs as a bookrunner, such legal expenses shall be borne by either the arrangers/underwriters or delphi, and not amlp and hcp, in accordance with the terms of the definitive agreements governing such financing). if ubs, after conducting due diligence, agrees to provide all (or its portion) of the necessary committed financing requested by amlp (it being understood that amlp may request that ubs provide only a portion of the committed financing as lead bookrunner of a syndicate) on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to amlp in respect of an amlp sponsored transaction and delphi pursues such transaction or a similar transaction supported by amlp in which ubs does not act as one of the lead bookrunners, then amlp and hcp agree, subject to section 11, to pay ubs a break-up fee (the "break-up fee") of $3,000,000 if such transaction is completed. 10. amlp and hcp, subject to section 11, agree to the indemnification and other agreements set forth in the indemnification annex attached hereto, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference and shall survive the termination, expiration or supersession of this agreement. 11. the obligations of amlp and hcp hereunder shall be several (and not joint and several) obligations. the pro rata share of amlp and hcp of any obligations hereunder is set forth opposite the name of amlp and hcp on the signature pages to this agreement. 12. each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) neither amlp nor hcp has determined to pursue or support any transaction (including, in the case of amlp, an amlp sponsored transaction), (ii) that amlp, in its sole discretion, may decide not to pursue an amlp sponsored transaction, (iii) that amlp and hcp have no understandings, agreements or arrangements, whatsoever, among themselves with respect to any transaction (including an amlp sponsored transaction) or with respect to the voting, disposition or any other investment decision with respect to the securities of delphi, and (iv) that amlp and hcp may vote, dispose of, invest in any securities of delphi without obligation or notice to any other party. 13. this agreement and any claim, counterclaim or dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in any way relating to this agreement ("claim"), directly or indirectly, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york. except as set forth below, no claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the state of new york located in the city and county of new york or in the united states district court for the southern district of new york, which courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and amlp, hcp and ubs consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. each of ubs, amlp and hcp waives all right to trial by jury in any proceeding or claim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or in any way relating to this agreement. 14. this agreement (including the attached indemnification annex) embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. if any provision of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such determination will not affect such provision in any other respect or any other provision of this agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. this agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified or waived except by an instrument in writing signed by ubs, amlp and hcp. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 15. this agreement (including the attached indemnification annex) shall be binding upon amlp, hcp and ubs and their respective successors and assigns. if the foregoing correctly sets forth our understanding, please indicate your acceptance thereof in the space provided below, whereupon this agreement and your acceptance shall constitute a binding agreement between us. very truly yours, ubs securities llc by: by: -------------------------- ------------------------- name: steven d. smith name: andrew kramer title: managing

agreement (the "amended nda") relates to discussions involving appaloosa management l.p. and its affiliates ("appaloosa") and harbinger capital partners master fund i, ltd. and its affiliates ("harbinger") (collectively, "you" or "your", it being understood that, unless otherwise determined by delphi corporation, harbinger will communicate with delphi only through appaloosa) involving delphi corporation ("delphi"), a debtor and debtor-in-possession in chapter 11 cases (the "chapter 11 cases") in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york (the "bankruptcy court") concerning possible negotiated business arrangements between you and the company (defined below). the amended nda amends and supersedes the confidential information, standstill and nondisclosure agreement, dated july 31, 2006, among delphi, appaloosa, and harbinger. in connection with your interest in and review of certain matters relating to delphi and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together with their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and other representatives, the "company"), the company may furnish to you certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information pertaining to the company which is reasonably necessary in order for you to evaluate a transaction (as defined below) and which the company reasonably determines is not competitively sensitive or legally privileged (such information is anticipated to include the financial presentations generally provided on a regular basis to the company's statutory committees and/or their advisors relating to the company's transformation plan which are reasonably necessary in order for you to evaluate a transaction). such information, in whole or in part, whether written or oral, together with any analyses, summaries, compilations, studies, forecasts, abstracts or documents prepared during the review of the company by you or your representatives (as defined below) which contain, are based upon or otherwise reflect such information, is hereinafter referred to as the "evaluation material." the term "evaluation material" does not include any information which you demonstrate: (a) previously was available to you on a non-confidential basis or by virtue of your becoming a member, if ever, of an official committee in the chapter 11 cases (provided, however, that any information made available to you in your capacity as a member of a statutory committee shall be kept confidential as may be required pursuant to agreements between such statutory committee and

company will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid providing you with information that the company expects is likely to be material non-public information as of the effective date of such a plan of reorganization and you shall follow appropriate procedures to screen information the company provides to you to avoid being in possession or having knowledge of material non-public information as of such date. if, however, you believe that you are in possession of material non-public information at the time a plan of reorganization becomes effective, you may request the company to make appropriate public disclosure such that the information would no longer be non-public, and the company will make such public disclosure if the company reasonably determines that such public disclosure would be in the best interests of the company and its constituents. if information subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other ground on which production of such information should not be made is nevertheless inadvertently produced by the company to you or your representatives, such production shall in no way prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of, or estoppel as to, any claim of privilege, work product or other ground for withholding production to which the company would otherwise be entitled. if a claim of inadvertent production is made pursuant to this paragraph with respect to information then in the custody of you or your representatives, then you or your representatives, as the case may be, shall, upon request, promptly return to

(a) if, at any time, any contributor gives notice (a "contribution notice") to the other contributors of a payment (which notice shall include either (x) a written notice or invoice from the company requesting a payment or (y) a certificate from the contributor who has made all or any portion of a payment stating that it has made such payment), then each contributor (i) shall be responsible for, and shall pay, such contributor's pro rata portion of such payment to the company, and (ii) shall, without duplication, reimburse the other contributors (as required based on the amount of such payment made by each such other contributor), in each case, in an amount equal to such contributor's pro rata portion of such payment. for the avoidance of doubt, the intent of this section 1 is to apportion the cumulative, aggregate amounts required to be paid by, and actually paid by, any contributor and all of the contributors (directly or indirectly) as or in respect of payments on a several basis among all contributors in accordance with their respective pro rata portions. without limiting the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the other provisions of this agreement or the rights and remedies of any contributor with respect thereto, if any contributor fails to pay or reimburse all or any portion of such contributor's pro rata portion of any payment (any such amount, a "shortfall"), and such failure continues for a period of ten (10) business days after the due date for such payment or reimbursement, each non-defaulting contributor, in addition to its respective obligations set forth above, (a) shall be responsible for, and shall pay to the company or, as the case may be, such other person or entity referred to in the first sentence of this section 1(a), its proportional share of the shortfall based its pro rata portion, but excluding the pro rata portion of the defaulting contributor (the "adjusted pro rata portion"), and (b) shall, without duplication, reimburse any non-defaulting contributor (as required based on the amount of the respective payments made by such non-defaulting contributors with respect to such shortfall), in each case, in an amount equal to the non-defaulting contributor's adjusted pro rata portion of such shortfall; provided, however, that nothing contained in this sentence shall relieve or release a defaulting contributor from any of its obligations and liabilities under this agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to reimburse the non-defaulting contributors for any payment or reimbursement made by the non-defaulting contributors with respect to any shortfall. notwithstanding the foregoing, a contributor shall only be required to make a payment pursuant to the terms hereof if the obligation to which the contribution notice relates arises out of circumstances existing on or prior to the closing date. (b) for purposes of this agreement: (x) "payment" or "payments" means any amount required to be paid or paid, directly or indirectly (i) (a) to the company by any contributor in respect of the obligations (including any liabilities, penalties, losses, damages, deficiencies and judgments required to be paid in respect thereto and including any payment to the company or cerberus made by amlp pursuant to the app/cerb contribution agreement) or any shortfall, or (b) otherwise to cerberus in respect of the obligations (including any liabilities, penalties, losses, damages, deficiencies and judgments required to be paid, in respect thereto); provided, however, that in no event shall any contributor be required to make payments pursuant to this subsection (x)(i) for an aggregate amount in excess of $250 million, and (ii) in respect of any interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) for investigation, defense and enforcement of the equity purchase and commitment agreement in respect of the obligations, the provisions of this agreement and the app/cerb contribution agreement and (y) "pro rata portion" with respect to any contributor means the percentage of the payment payable hereunder by such contributor, whether to the company or to any other entity, which percentage shall initially be the percentage set forth next to such contributor's name on exhibit a attached hereto. the pro rata portion shall only be changed in connection with the occurrence of the events set forth in section 1(d) in which case, the percentage for each contributor shall be calculated by dividing (a) the aggregate amount required to be paid by such contributors, in each case, for (x) the direct subscription shares, (y) the series b preferred stock, and (z) the series a-2 preferred stock (provide that the amount required to be paid in respect of the series a-2 preferred stock shall be calculated based on each contributor's proposed economic interest in the series a-2 preferred stock pursuant to the certain agreement of limited partnership of del a-2 l.p. dated as of even date herewith), by (b) the sum of the payments under subsection (a) with respect to all contributors. (c) all amounts due hereunder shall be paid, or, as applicable, reimbursed by the contributors in immediately available funds to the company or, as the case may be, another contributor within two (2) business days after receipt by the contributors of a contribution notice (or, with respect to payments and reimbursements in connection with any shortfall, within two (2) business days after the expiration of the ten (10) business day period referred to in section 1(a)) and any amounts not paid within such time shall accrue interest at a rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum (compounded quarterly), but in no event in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. each contributor hereby waives any right to question the validity or amount of any payment made by any other contributor, it being intended that the actual payment to the company of any payment or the incurrence of any liabilities, losses, damages, deficiencies, judgments and costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties, out-of-pocket expenses for investigation, defense and enforcement, and reasonable attorney's fees) referred to in the definition of "payment" in section 1(a) shall conclusively establish any contributor's (who has made a payment) right to be reimbursed pursuant to this section 1.
