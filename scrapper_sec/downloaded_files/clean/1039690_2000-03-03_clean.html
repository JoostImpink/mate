(c) no dividends or other distributions declared or made, or any other cash or other property paid, after the effective time with respect to shares of surviving corporation common stock with a record date after the effective time (such dividends or distributions being referred to collectively herein as the "pre-surrender dividends") will be paid to the holder of any ----------------------- unsurrendered delaware company stock certificate with respect to the shares of surviving corporation common stock that such holder is entitled to receive upon the surrender thereof in accordance with this section 2.3. subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such delaware company stock certificate, there will be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of surviving corporation common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of the pre-surrender dividends theretofore paid or issued with respect to such whole shares of surviving corporation common stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of pre-surrender dividends with a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of surviving corporation common stock. (d) the merger consideration paid or delivered as provided above, together with any pre-surrender dividends, will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of delaware company common stock and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares of delaware company common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, delaware company stock certificates are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this article ii. (e) no fractional shares of and no certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of surviving corporation common stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of delaware company stock certificates. in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of surviving corporation common stock pursuant to section 2.1(i), as -8- promptly as practicable following the effective time, the exchange agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of surviving corporation common stock delivered to the exchange agent by the surviving corporation pursuant to this article ii over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of the surviving corporation common stock to be issued to holders of delaware company stock certificates pursuant to this article ii (such excess being herein called the "excess shares"). as soon after the effective time as practicable, ------------- the exchange agent, as agent for the holders of delaware company stock certificates, shall sell the excess shares at then prevailing prices on the new york stock exchange ("nyse"), all in the manner provided in this section. ---- the sale of the excess shares by the exchange agent shall be executed on the nyse through one or more member firms of the nyse and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. the exchange agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the excess shares as promptly following the effective time as, in the exchange agent's reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of delaware company stock certificates, the exchange agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of delaware company stock certificates entitled to receive shares of surviving corporation common stock under this article ii (the "common stock trust"). the surviving ------------------ corporation shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation, of the exchange agent incurred in connection with such sale of the excess shares. the exchange agent shall determine the portion of the common stock trust to which each holder of a delaware company stock certificate entitled to receive surviving corporation common stock under this article ii shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds compromising the common stock trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of a delaware company stock certificate would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all delaware company stock certificates then held by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interest to which all holders of delaware company stock certificates would otherwise be entitled. -9- notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section 2.3(e), if the parties shall so agree in writing prior to the effective time, then in lieu of the sale of excess shares and the making of the payments contemplated above, each holder of a delaware company stock certificate shall be paid an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all delaware company stock certificates then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by the closing price for a share of texas company common stock on the nyse composite transactions tape on the first business day immediately preceding the effective time, and, in such case, all references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale of the excess shares and similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to the payments calculated as set forth in this sentence. as soon as practicable after the determination of the amounts of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of delaware company stock certificates in lieu of any fractional share interests, the exchange agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of delaware company stock certificates, subject to and in accordance with this article ii. (f) the surviving corporation shall not be liable to any holder of shares of delaware company common stock for any shares of surviving corporation common stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (g) any portion of the exchange fund or the common stock trust that remains undistributed to the holders of delaware company stock certificates for one year after the effective time will be delivered to the surviving corporation, upon demand, and any holders of delaware company stock certificates who have not theretofore complied with this article ii will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for the merger consideration and any unpaid pre- surrender dividends to which they are entitled pursuant to this article ii. (h) the surviving corporation or the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of delaware company stock certificates such amounts as the surviving corporation or the exchange agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that -10- amounts are so withheld by the surviving corporation or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the delaware company stock certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the surviving corporation or the exchange agent. notwithstanding the foregoing, no amount shall be withheld from any payment made hereunder to a holder of delaware company stock certificates who provides the exchange agent with a properly completed internal revenue service form w-9 or substitute form w-9, or who otherwise provides the exchange agent with appropriate evidence that such person is exempt from federal income tax back-up withholding. section 2.4 texas company eligible shares.

(b) in connection with any registration of restricted shares under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, each seller of restricted shares shall indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in the preceding paragraph of -19- this section) the company, each director of the company, each officer of the company, each underwriter, broker or other person acting on behalf of such seller, each person who controls any of the foregoing persons within the meaning of the securities act and each other seller of restricted shares under such registration statement with respect to any statement or omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or otherwise filed with the commission, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incident to registration or qualification of any restricted shares, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company or such underwriter through an instrument duly executed by such seller specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, amendment, supplement or document; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify will be several, not joint - -------- ------- and several, among such sellers of restricted shares, and the maximum amount of liability in respect of such indemnification shall be in proportion to and limited to, in the case of each seller of restricted shares, an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such seller from the sale of restricted shares effected pursuant to such registration. (c) the indemnification required by this section 10 will be made by periodic payments during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred, subject to prompt refund in the event any such payments are determined not to have been due and owing hereunder. (d) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this section, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action (it being understood that no delay in delivering or failure to deliver such notice shall relieve the indemnifying persons from any liability or obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the indemnifying person is prejudiced by such delay and/or failure). in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if any indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded - -------- ------- that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party which are additional to or conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, or that such claim or litigation involves or could have an effect upon matters beyond the scope of the indemnity agreement provided in this section, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party and such indemnifying party shall reimburse such indemnified party and any person controlling such indemnified party for that portion of the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the indemnified party which is reasonably related to the matters covered by the indemnity agreement provided in this section. (e) the indemnification provided for under this agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or -20- any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities. (f) if the indemnification provided for in this section 10 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the sellers of restricted shares agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which did not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. the amount paid or payable to an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitation set forth in the fourth paragraph of this section 10, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the amount contributed by a seller of restricted shares exceed the aggregate net offering proceeds received by such seller from the sale of its restricted shares. section 11. underwriting agreement. ---------------------- notwithstanding the provisions of sections 9 and 10, to the extent that the company and the holders selling restricted shares in a proposed registration shall enter into an underwriting or similar agreement, which agreement contains provisions covering one or more issues addressed in such sections, the provisions contained in such sections addressing such issue or issues shall be superseded with respect to such registration by such other agreement. section 12. information by holders. ---------------------- the holders selling restricted shares in a proposed registration shall furnish to the company such written information regarding such holder and the distribution proposed by such holder as the company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this agreement. section 13. exchange act compliance. ----------------------- the company shall comply with all of the reporting requirements of the exchange act and with all other public information reporting requirements of the commission -21- which are conditions to the availability of rule 144 for the sale of the common stock. the company shall cooperate with the investor in supplying such information as may be necessary for such investor to complete and file any information reporting forms presently or hereafter required by the commission as a condition to the availability of rule 144. section 14. no conflict of rights. --------------------- the company represents and warrants to the investors that the registration rights granted to the investors hereby do not conflict with any other registration rights granted by the company. the company shall not, after the date hereof, grant any registration rights which conflict with the registration rights granted hereby; provided, however, that such prohibition shall not apply to the assumption by the company of any registration right obligations of building one services corporation. section 15. protective provisions. --------------------- (a) until the maturity date (assuming full payment and performance by the company of all of its obligations as of such date, if the company has not fully paid and performed all of its obligations as of such date, it being understood that the company's obligations under this section shall survive until such obligations have been satisfied), and so long as (x) if the convertible preferred stock has been converted into shares of common stock after the receipt by the holders of notice of the company's intention to redeem the convertible preferred stock pursuant to the statement of designations, then for two years from the date of such conversion, provided that, the investor and its affiliates hold in the aggregate common stock equivalents representing at least 25% of the conversion shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock issued on the closing date, or (y) the investor and its affiliates hold in the aggregate at least 25% of the shares of convertible preferred stock issued on the closing date, the company shall not, and shall not permit any subsidiary, without the prior written consent of the investor, to take any of the following actions;

(m) mutual waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in --------------------------- connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the parties desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, the parties hereto waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding brought to -29- enforce or defend any rights or remedies under this agreement or any documents related hereto. -30- in witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this agreement on the date first written above. group maintenance america corp. by: ------------------------------ name: title: boss ii, llc by: ------------------------------ name: title: -31- ex-99.4 5 terms of preferred stock terms of preferred stock 1. rights, preferences and powers of the convertible preferred stock. ----------------------------------------------------------------- the convertible preferred stock shall have the following rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions, qualifications, and limitations. 2. dividends. --------- (a) the holders of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to receive dividends at the applicable dividend rate on the accumulated amount, if, as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. such dividends shall be payable in arrears on each of march 31, june 30, september 30 and december 31 (each, a "preferred dividend payment date"), the first such preferred ------------------------------- dividend payment date being march 31, 2000, except that if any preferred dividend payment date is not a business day, then the preferred dividend payment date shall be on the first immediately succeeding business day. such dividends shall accrue on a daily basis (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) commencing on the date of issuance, and shall compound, if not paid in cash when due, on the next preferred dividend payment date, regardless of whether the board has declared a dividend payment or whether there are any profits, surplus or other funds of the corporation legally available for dividends.

(g) in addition to all dividends payable pursuant to sections 2(a) through (d), whenever the corporation shall declare any dividend on its common stock (other than a distribution described in section 4(e)(5) or a dividend described in section 4(e)(11) (a "common dividend")), the holders --------------- of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock shall have the option, exercisable by the requisite convertible preferred shareholders to (i) participate in such dividends on a ratable basis with such common stock, pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of common stock --- ---- into which such shares of convertible preferred stock are then convertible (the "cash election"), or (ii) reduce the conversion price then in effect ------------- by the amount of dividends payable with respect to one share of common stock or, if not payable in cash, by an amount equal to the fair market value of such dividends. the corporation shall notify each holder of convertible preferred stock within two business days following the date on which the board declares a common dividend, which notice shall specify the amount of such dividend per share of such common stock. if the corporation shall have received, prior to the 10th day following the date of such notice from the corporation (the "determination date"), notices from the requisite preferred shareholders electing the cash election, then the holders of record of convertible preferred stock as of the determination date shall be entitled to receive, out of funds legally available therefor, the common dividend in accordance with clause (i). any such dividend shall be payable no later than 10 business days after the determination date. unless a cash election has been made prior to the determination date, the adjustment to the conversion price specified in clause (ii) shall become effective as of the close of the business on the determination date. 2 3. liquidation. ----------- upon a liquidation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the corporation and the liquidation preference of any class or series of capital stock of the corporation ranking senior to the convertible preferred stock, the holders of convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, out of the remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to its shareholders, with respect to each share of convertible preferred stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the liquidation amount of such share and (ii) the amount the holder of such share would have received if such holder had converted such share of convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, before any distribution shall be made to the holders of the common stock or any other class or series of capital stock of the corporation ranking junior to the convertible preferred stock. if upon any liquidation the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its shareholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of convertible preferred stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of convertible preferred stock shall share in any distribution of assets pro rata in accordance with the total amount that each such holder would have - --- ---- received had there been such sufficient assets. 4. conversion. ---------- (a) upon the terms set forth in this section 4, each holder of shares of convertible preferred stock shall have the right, at such holder's option, at any time and from time to time, to convert all or any portion of such shares into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the aggregate liquidation amount of the shares of convertible preferred stock to be converted by (b) the conversion price (as defined below), as last adjusted and then in effect, by surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares in accordance with this section 4. the initial conversion price per share at which shares of common stock shall be issuable upon conversion of shares of convertible preferred stock (the "conversion price") shall be $14.00, subject to adjustment as set forth ---------------- herein. (b) any holder of shares of convertible preferred stock electing to convert all or any portion of the shares in accordance with section 4(a) above shall give written notice to the corporation as specified herein (which notice may be given by facsimile transmission) that such holder elects to convert the same and shall state therein the number of shares of convertible preferred stock to be converted and the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. promptly thereafter, the holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing the shares of convertible preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for such shares, or at such other place designated by the corporation, provided that the corporation shall at all times maintain an office or agency for such purposes. the corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such notice, issue and deliver to or upon the order of such holder, against delivery of the certificates representing the shares of convertible preferred stock that have been converted, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled (in the number(s) and denomination(s) designated by 3 such holder), and the corporation shall deliver to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of convertible preferred stock that such holder has not elected to convert. to the extent the holder requests that the shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion shall be issued in the name of any person other than the holder of the convertible preferred stock surrendered for conversion, such holder shall deliver to the corporation (and its transfer agent, if applicable) such documents and certificates, including, if requested, an opinion of counsel to the effect that the transfer thereof will not constitute a violation of the securities act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws. the corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of convertible preferred stock or due on the issuance of a new certificate or certificates for any convertible preferred stock not converted, other than any tax in respect of any transfer involved in any issuance of shares of common stock in a name other than the name in which the shares of convertible preferred stock so converted were registered. the conversion right with respect to any shares of convertible preferred stock shall be deemed to have been exercised at the earliest date upon which both the notice of conversion referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph and the certificates therefor shall have been so delivered (the "conversion ---------- date") and the person or persons entitled to receive the common stock ---- issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common stock upon that date. (c) no fractional shares of common stock or scrip shall be issued upon conversion of shares of convertible preferred stock. the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of such convertible preferred stock to be converted. instead of any fractional shares of common stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any such shares, the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the product of (i) the fair market value of one share of common stock and (ii) such fractional interest. the holders of fractional interests shall not be entitled to any rights as shareholders of the corporation in respect of such fractional interests. (d) the corporation shall reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock a sufficient number of shares of common stock to permit the conversion of all of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock. for the purposes of this section 4(d), the full number of shares of common stock then issuable upon the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were held by a single holder. the corporation shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of the state of texas and its articles of incorporation, increase the authorized amount of its common stock if at any time the authorized amount of its common stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all shares of convertible preferred stock at the time outstanding. all shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the shares of convertible preferred stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 4 (e) the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (1) if the corporation shall, (a) at any time or from time to time after the original issuance date through the date that is two and one-half (2 1/2) years after the original issuance date, issue any shares of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, other than excluded stock, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the greater of (x) the conversion price or (y) the fair market value of the common stock, in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such common stock or securities, or (b) at any time or from time to time after the date that is two and one-half (2 1/2) years after the original issuance date, issue any shares of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, other than excluded stock, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the fair market value of the common stock, in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such common stock or securities, then such conversion price, as in effect immediately prior to each such issuance, shall forthwith be lowered to a price equal to the price obtained by multiplying: (a) the conversion price at which shares of convertible preferred stock were theretofore convertible by (b) a fraction of which (x) the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after such issuance and (y) the numerator shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately prior to the date of such issuance and (2) the number of additional shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the number of shares of common stock so offered would purchase at the greater of the conversion price or the fair market value per share of common stock. (2) if the corporation shall, at any time or from time to time after the original issuance date, directly or indirectly, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock, options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, for a consideration per share greater than the fair market value (plus, in the case of such options, rights, or securities, the additional consideration required to be paid to the corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange) for shares of common stock in effect immediately prior to such event, then such conversion price, as in effect immediately prior to each such event, shall forthwith be lowered to a price equal to the price obtained by multiplying: 5 (a) the conversion price at which shares of convertible preferred stock were theretofore convertible by (b) a fraction of which (x) the denominator shall be the fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to such event and (y) the numerator shall be the result of dividing: i) (1) the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and the fair market value per share of common stock, in each case immediately prior to such event, minus (2) the aggregate consideration paid by the corporation in such event (plus, in the case of such options, rights, or convertible or exchangeable securities, the aggregate additional consideration to be paid by the corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange), by ii) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after such redemption. (3) for the purposes of any adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to sections 4(e)(1) or (2) above, the following provisions shall be applicable: (a) in the case of the issuance of common stock for cash in a public offering or private placement, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor by the investors without deducting any discounts, commissions or placement fees payable by the corporation to any underwriter or placement agent in connection with the issuance and sale thereof that are usual and customary for such a transaction. notwithstanding anything provided above to the contrary, for purposes of issuances described in this clause, fair market value for such issuance shall be deemed to be the lesser of (i) the closing price on the date of the execution of the underwriting, placement, subscription or purchase agreement executed in connection with such offering or placement and (ii) the fair market value (as defined herein) determined as of the date of the execution of the underwriting, placement, subscription or purchase agreement executed in connection with such offering or placement. (b) in the case of the issuance of common stock for consideration consisting in whole or in part other than cash, the value of such non-cash consideration shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the board or a duly authorized committee thereof, irrespective of any accounting treatment. notwithstanding anything provided above to the contrary, for purposes of issuances described in this clause, fair market value for such issuance shall be deemed to be the fair market value as determined in good faith by 6 the board or a duly authorized committee thereof, irrespective of any accounting treatment, as of the date of the approval of such transaction by the board or appropriate committee of the board. (c) in the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, except for options to acquire excluded stock: i) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in sections 4(e)(3)(a) and (b) above), if any, received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options or rights for the common stock covered thereby; ii) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities, options, or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration received by the corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in sections 4(e)(3)(a) and (b) above); and iii) on any change in the number of shares or exercise price of common stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options or rights or conversions of or exchanges for such securities, other than a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the applicable conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted to such conversion price as would have been obtained had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights 7 or securities not converted prior to such change or options or rights related to such securities not converted prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change; iv) upon the expiration of the right to convert, exchange or acquire common stock in accordance with the terms of any securities, the issuance of which securities had effected an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to the terms of this section 4(e), if any such securities shall not have been converted, exercised or exchanged prior to such expiration, the number of shares of common stock deemed to have been issued and outstanding by reason of the fact that they were issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any such security pursuant to section 4(e)(l) above, shall no longer be computed as set forth above and the conversion price shall forthwith be readjusted and thereafter be the price at which it would have been had the adjustment to the conversion price made upon the issuance or sale of any such security been made on the basis of the issuance only of the number of additional shares of common stock actually issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof and thereupon only the number of additional shares of common stock actually so issued shall be deemed to have been issued and the only consideration actually received by the corporation (computed as set forth above) shall be deemed to have been received by the corporation; and v) no further adjustment of the conversion price adjusted upon the issuance of any such options, rights, convertible securities or exchangeable securities shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of common stock on the exercise of any such rights or options or any conversion or exchange of any such securities. (4) all calculations under this section will be made to the nearest one- hundredth of a cent or to the nearest whole share, as the case may be. no adjustment to the conversion price will be required unless such adjustment would result in an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the conversion price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this clause (4) are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in a subsequent adjustment, if any. (5) if, at any time after the original issuance date, the number of shares of common stock outstanding is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of common stock or by a subdivision or split-up of shares of common stock, then the provisions of section 4(e)(1) shall not apply and, following the record 8 date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive such stock dividend, subdivision or split-up, the conversion price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of convertible preferred stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase in outstanding shares. (6) if, at any time after the original issuance date, the number of shares of common stock outstanding is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of common stock, then, following the record date for such combination, the conversion price shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of convertible preferred stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares. (7) in the event of any capital reorganization of the corporation, any reclassification of the stock of the corporation (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up or combination of shares), or any consolidation or merger of the corporation (other than the merger), each share of convertible preferred stock shall after such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, or merger be convertible into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or of the corporation resulting from such consolidation or surviving such merger to which the holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable (immediately prior to the time of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger) upon conversion of such share of convertible preferred stock would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger. the provisions of this clause shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, or mergers. (8) in any case in which the provisions of this section 4(e) shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date of an event, the corporation may defer until the occurrence of such event (1) issuing to the holder of any share of convertible preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the shares of capital stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event in addition to the shares of capital stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustments, and (2) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share of capital stock pursuant to section 4(c) above; provided, -------- however, that the corporation shall deliver to such holder an appropriate ------- instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares and such cash. (9) whenever a conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in this section 4(e), the corporation shall make available for inspection during regular business hours, at its principal executive offices or at such other place as may be designated by the corporation, a statement, signed by its chief financial officer, showing in detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the conversion price 9 that shall be in effect after such adjustment. the corporation shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by first class certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to each holder of convertible preferred stock affected by the adjustment at such holder's address appearing on the corporation's records. where appropriate, such copy may be given in advance and may be included, as part of any notice required to be mailed under the provisions of this section 4(e) below. (10) if the corporation shall propose to take any action of the types described in clauses (5), (6) or (7) of this section 4(e), the corporation shall give notice to each holder of shares of convertible preferred stock, in the manner set forth in clause (9) above, which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the date on which such action is to take place. such notice shall also set forth such facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect of such action (to the extent such effect may be known at the date of such notice) on the conversion price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable or purchasable upon the occurrence of such action or deliverable upon conversion of shares of convertible preferred stock. in the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 30 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action. (11) without duplication of any other adjustment provided for in this section 4, at any time the corporation makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the corporation other than shares of common stock, provision shall be made so that each holder of convertible preferred stock shall have the option to (i) receive as part of such dividend or distribution the number of securities of the corporation which such holder would have received had its shares of convertible preferred stock been converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the date of such event or (ii) receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the number of securities of the corporation which such holder would have received had its shares of convertible preferred stock been converted into shares of common stock on the date of such event and had such holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by it pursuant to this paragraph during such period, subject to the sum of all other adjustments called for during such period under this section 4 with respect to the rights of such holder of convertible preferred stock. (12) if the corporation issues any securities after the original issuance date containing provisions protecting the holder or holders thereof against dilution in any manner more favorable to such holder or holders thereof than 10 those set forth in this section 4, such provisions (or any more favorable portion thereof) shall be deemed to be incorporated herein as if fully set forth in this statement and, to the extent inconsistent with any provision of this statement, shall be deemed to be substituted therefor. 5. redemption at option of the corporation. --------------------------------------- (a) the corporation shall have the right to redeem, at any time after the fifth anniversary of the original issuance date, out of funds legally available for such purpose, all, but not less than all, of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding, for an amount per share (the "corporation ----------- redemption price"), which shall be payable in cash, as set forth below: - ---------------- (i) 103% of the liquidation amount, if such redemption occurs on or after the fifth anniversary of the original issuance date and before the sixth anniversary date of the original issuance date; (ii) 102% of the liquidation amount, if such redemption occurs on or after the sixth anniversary of the original issuance date and before the eighth anniversary date of the original issuance date; and (iii) 101% of the liquidation amount, if such redemption occurs on or after the eighth anniversary of the original issuance date but prior to the maturity date. (b) not less than 20 nor more than 60 days (such date as fixed by the board of directors of the corporation is referred to herein as the "redemption record ----------------- date") prior to the date fixed for any redemption of shares of the convertible - ---- preferred stock pursuant to this section 5, a notice specifying the time and place of the redemption, the redemption price and the number of shares to be redeemed shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of record on the redemption record date of the shares of the convertible preferred stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the corporation, calling upon each holder of record to surrender to the corporation on the redemption date at the place designated in the notice such holder's certificate or certificates representing the number of shares specified in the notice of redemption. neither failure to mail such notice, nor any defect therein or in the mailing hereof, to any particular holder shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the holder receives the notice. on or after the redemption date, each holder of shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed shall present and surrender such holder's certificate or certificates for such shares to the corporation at the place designated in the redemption notice and thereupon the corporation redemption price shall be paid to or on the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. 11 (c) if a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to this section 5 and if, on or before the redemption date, the funds necessary for such redemption (including all dividends on the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed that will accrue to the redemption date) shall have been set aside by the corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro --- rata benefit of the holders of the shares of convertible preferred stock so - ---- called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares of convertible preferred stock have not been surrendered for cancellation, on the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on the shares of the convertible preferred stock to be redeemed, and the holders of such shares shall cease to be shareholders with respect to those shares and shall have no voting or other rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the moneys payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement, if required by the corporation) of their certificates, and the shares of convertible preferred stock evidenced thereby shall no longer be outstanding, provided, however, nothing in this section 5 -------- ------- will limit the right of the holders of shares of convertible preferred stock to convert such shares after the notice of redemption has been given and prior to the redemption date in accordance with section 4. if the holder of any shares of convertible preferred stock shall not, within one year after the redemption date, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, such funds shall be released to the corporation and held thereby until such holder shall make a claim therefor. (d) if a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to this section 5 and any holder of shares of convertible preferred stock shall, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date, give written notice to the corporation pursuant to section 4 above of the conversion of any or all of the shares to be redeemed held by the holder (accompanied by a certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed or assigned to the corporation, as required by section 4 above), then such redemption shall not become effective as to such shares to be converted and such conversion shall become effective as provided in section 4 above, whereupon any funds deposited by the corporation for the redemption of such shares shall immediately upon such conversion be returned to the corporation or, if then held in trust by the corporation, shall automatically and without further corporate action or notice be discharged from the trust. 6. redemption at the option of the holders. --------------------------------------- (a) each holder of convertible preferred stock shall have the right to require the corporation to redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, any or all of such holder's shares of convertible preferred stock at the redemption price, plus the amount described in the first sentence of section 2(d), in connection with the occurrence of a change of control as set forth herein. (b) the corporation shall notify the holders of the convertible preferred stock in writing promptly upon the occurrence of a change of control; provided, -------- however, that any failure by the corporation to provide such notice shall not - ------- affect the right of the holders of shares of convertible preferred stock to require a redemption of such shares in 12 connection with such change of control. such notice shall state the terms and conditions of such change of control. (c) in the event the requisite convertible preferred shareholders expect that a change of control will occur, the requisite convertible preferred shareholders may so notify the corporation, which notice shall specify the circumstances constituting the expected change of control. within three business days following the receipt by the corporation of such notice, the corporation shall notify each holder of convertible preferred stock of the receipt of such notice from the requisite convertible preferred shareholders. for a period of 15 days following such notice by the corporation, each holder of convertible preferred stock may elect to have any or all of such holder's shares of convertible preferred stock redeemed under this section 6(c) by providing an irrevocable written notice (a "section 6(c) redemption notice") to the ------------------------------ corporation of such election; provided, however, no redemption shall be effected -------- ------- prior to the consummation of the change of control. the corporation shall effect such redemption on the later to occur of (i) 15 days following receipt by the corporation of such section 6(c) redemption notice and (ii) the date of the consummation of such change of control (such date on which redemption is required, the "redemption date") and the holders of record of shares of --------------- convertible preferred stock being redeemed in accordance with this section 6(c) shall promptly deliver certificates representing the shares being redeemed to the corporation or its agents. if a holder has delivered a section 6(c) redemption notice and no change of control shall have been consummated within 180 days from the date of such section 6(c) redemption notice, then such section 6(c) redemption notice shall be null and void and the holders shall again be entitled to deliver a new section 6(c) redemption notice in accordance with the terms of this section 6(c). (d) if the corporation has delivered to the holders of the convertible preferred stock a notice pursuant to section 6(b) above that a change of control has occurred, each holder of convertible preferred stock may elect to have any or all of such holder's shares of convertible preferred stock redeemed under this section 6(d) by providing an irrevocable written notice (a "section 6(d) ------------ redemption notice") to the corporation of such election at any time prior to the - ----------------- 90th day following the date of the corporation's notice given pursuant to section 6(b) (the "expiration date"). the corporation shall effect the --------------- redemption of all shares pursuant to this section 6(d) on the date which is 15 days after the expiration date. (e) if, on or before any redemption date specified in paragraph (c) or (d) above, the funds necessary for such redemption (including all dividends on the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed that will accrue to the redemption date) shall have been set aside by the corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares of convertible preferred stock so called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares of convertible preferred stock have not been surrendered for cancellation, on the redemption date, dividends shall cease to accrue on the shares of the convertible preferred stock to be redeemed, and the holders of such shares shall cease to be shareholders with respect to those shares and shall have no voting or other rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the monies payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon 13 surrender (and endorsement, if required by the corporation) of their certificates, and the shares of convertible preferred stock evidenced thereby shall no longer be outstanding. upon delivery to the corporation of an irrevocable notice from a holder of convertible preferred stock pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) above, the right of such holder to convert the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed into shares of common stock pursuant to section 4 shall cease and terminate. if the holder of any shares of convertible preferred stock shall not, within one year after the redemption date, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, such funds shall be released to the corporation and held thereby until such holder shall make a claim therefor. on and after the redemption date pursuant to either section 6(c) or (d) above (unless default shall be made by the corporation in the payment of the applicable redemption price, in which event such rights shall be exercisable until such default is cured), all rights in respect of the shares of convertible preferred stock to be redeemed, except the right to receive the redemption price, shall cease and terminate, and such shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not the certificates representing such shares have been received by the corporation. (f) if the assets of the corporation available for redemption of the convertible preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the entire redemption price required to be paid pursuant to this section 6, then the holders of convertible preferred stock shall share ratably in any such redemption based on the respective number of shares of convertible preferred stock that each holder thereof holds.
