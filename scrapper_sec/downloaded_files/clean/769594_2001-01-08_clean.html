group common stock. docomo currently plans to assign this right to dcm capital. the new tracking stock is designed to track the performance of the at&t wireless group (as defined in the at&t certificate of incorporation). as of the date hereof, docomo contemplates that the funds to be used to consummate the purchase of the new tracking stock and warrants shall come from a short-term loan of 1.2 trillion yen from various lenders. the aggregate purchase price payable by docomo for the new tracking stock and warrants (in each case as described in items 5 and 6 below) is $9,811,079,720.

enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d. each of ntt, docomo and dcm capital, however, expects to evaluate on an ongoing basis at&t's financial condition, business, operations and prospects, the market price of at&t's stock, conditions in the securities markets generally, general economic and industry conditions and other factors. accordingly, each of ntt, docomo and dcm capital reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate, subject to relevant legal restrictions and certain contractual restrictions described in item 6 below. item 6 also describes the reporting persons' plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer

wholly-owned subsidiary of at&t ("at&t wireless"), and at&t entered into a letter agreement with attached term sheet and annexes thereto (collectively, the "letter agreement") providing for the acquisition by docomo of (1) shares of a new series of preferred stock of at&t, the new tracking stock, which is designed to track the performance of at&t's wireless group and is convertible into shares of at&t's wireless group common stock and (2) warrants to acquire additional shares of new tracking stock. on december 20, 2000, docomo, at&t wireless and at&t entered into a securities purchase agreement, an investor agreement and a warrant agreement that superseded the letter agreement in its entirety. the number of shares of new tracking stock to be issued to docomo pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and issuable upon exercise of the warrants is as set forth in item 5. the shares of wireless group common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of new tracking stock to be issued to docomo constitute approximately 55.4% of the wireless group common stock outstanding, representing approximately a 17.4% interest in the wireless group. the investor agreement also provides for a strategic alliance between docomo and at&t wireless involving the formation by at&t wireless of a subsidiary that will serve as a vehicle for the parties to cooperate in operational and technological matters affecting the delivery of mobile multimedia services as well as the development and delivery of mobile multimedia content and applications in north america. assignment. under the securities purchase agreement, the investor agreement and the warrant agreement, docomo has the right to assign its interest in such agreements to a wholly-owned subsidiary of docomo, provided that such subsidiary assumes docomo's obligations under those agreements. docomo currently expects to assign its rights under those agreements to dcm capital. use of proceeds. the securities purchase agreement provides that $6,159,464,289 of the proceeds from the investment will be contributed to at&t wireless simultaneously with the closing of the investment and $3,651,615,431 will be retained by at&t corp. directors and officers. prior to the date of the spin-off of at&t's wireless group (the "spin-off"), docomo is entitled to designate one director to the at&t board of directors and one member of the at&t capital stock committee. docomo also has the right to appoint at least two and no more than five docomo employees as employees of at&t wireless. these employees will have the titles of "manager-finance" and/or "director of technology," or such other titles as docomo and at&t wireless shall agree. docomo will lose these management positions in the event docomo's share of the wireless group falls below 10% for a period of 60 days or more. however, so long as docomo retains at least 10/16 of its original investment, docomo will not lose these positions unless its share of the wireless group falls below 8% for a period of 60 days or more. in addition, docomo will be entitled to select one senior executive of docomo to serve on the senior leadership team of at&t wireless to participate in meetings in which principal decisions relating to at&t wireless are discussed. voting rights. pursuant to a certificate of amendment attached as an exhibit to the securities purchase agreement and that sets forth the terms of the new tracking stock, each share of new tracking stock will be entitled to a number of votes per share equal to the number of votes to which the wireless group common stock into which such share of new tracking stock is then convertible is entitled. voting agreements. pursuant to the investor agreement, docomo agrees to vote its shares with respect to the election of directors to the at&t board either (1) in favor of the slate of directors nominated by the board of directors or (2) for, against, or abstaining with respect to each nominee for director in the same proportion as the votes of all stockholders other than docomo and its affiliates. standstill provisions. for a period of two years from the consummation of the spin-off, docomo may not, subject to certain exceptions, (1) acquire directly or indirectly beneficial ownership of any additional voting securities or assets of at&t, (2) enter into or publicly propose to enter into any merger or other business combination or change of control involving at&t or its subsidiaries, (3) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of securities of at&t, (4) call a meeting of the shareholders of at&t or initiate any shareholder proposal, (5) contest the standstill described herein or seek a release from such standstill in a way that would lead to public disclosure thereof, (6) form, join or participate in a "group" within the meaning of rule 13(d)(3) promulgated under the securities exchange act, as amended, with respect to any securities of at&t, (7) seek any representation on the at&t board of directors other than as provided by the investor agreement, or seek the removal of any directors from the at&t board of directors or seek a change in the size or composition of the at&t board of directors, (8) enter into any discussions or negotiations with respect to any of the foregoing, (9) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement with respect to the foregoing, (10) take, solicit, propose or agree with any other person to take any actions designed to affect or change the control of the board of directors, senior executive management or voting equity of at&t or (11) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. preemptive rights. subject to certain limitations, docomo shall have the right to participate in any new equity issuances by at&t to maintain docomo's proportionate interest in at&t's wireless group. in the event docomo's interest in the wireless group falls below 10% for a period of 60 days or more, docomo would lose this preemptive right. however, if docomo retains at least 10/16 of its original investment, docomo will not lose its preemptive rights unless its ownership drops below 8% for a period of 60 days. spin-off related put right. subject to certain limitations, if at&t has not consummated the spin-off by january 1, 2002 (or by march 15, 2002, provided at&t has not received a satisfactory tax ruling on the spin-off but is actively seeking such ruling), docomo will have the option to require at&t to repurchase from docomo the new tracking stock and warrants. the repurchase price will be equal to docomo's original purchase price of the new tracking stock and warrants, plus interest thereon from the initial issuance date to the date of redemption at a rate per annum that will vary based on the time period from closing to the redemption (the "cost of carry"). technology default obligation. under the investor agreement, at&t has agreed to launch service based on w-cdma technology in 13 of the 50 top wireless markets in the united states by june 30, 2004. subject to certain limitations, in the event at&t fails to meet this technology commitment, except for causes beyond at&t's control, or if at&t's board of directors should approve a change to an alternative third-generation technology, docomo will have the right to cause at&t to repurchase the new tracking stock and warrants. the repurchase price will equal the original purchase price plus docomo's cost of carry thereon from initial issuance to the repurchase date. at&t has the right, as an alternative to the repurchase, to cause docomo to sell its shares of new tracking stock in the market (pursuant to a registered offering), provided that at&t will reimburse docomo for any amount by which the proceeds in such public sale are less than the otherwise applicable repurchase price. redemption. under the terms of the new tracking stock, at&t has the right to redeem the new tracking stock under certain circumstances. first, at&t may redeem the new tracking stock, in the event of a "tax event" with respect to the wireless group common stock that would have similar consequences with respect to the new tracking stock. generally, a tax event with respect to the wireless group common stock means the receipt by at&t of an opinion of counsel that there is a substantial likelihood that changes in the tax laws would (i) cause the issuance of wireless group common stock to be treated as a sale or other disposition, (ii) cause the wireless group common stock to be treated as other than capital stock under the tax laws or (iii) subject at&t, its subsidiaries or the shareholders or at&t or at&t wireless to adverse tax consequences by virtue of the wireless group common stock. second, at&t may redeem the new tracking stock in the event at&t shall not have completed the spin-off by april 26, 2002, shall have abandoned the spin-off and shall have no intention to complete the spin-off. in each case, the right of redemption is subject to the redemption of all outstanding shares of wireless group common stock. the redemption price payable to docomo is docomo's original purchase price of the new tracking stock and warrants, plus cost of carry thereon from the initial issuance date to the date annual rate of redemption, plus interest thereon at a 3% for the period from initial issuance to redemption. veto rights. under the investor agreement, subject to certain limitations, at&t will not take any of the following actions without the consent of docomo: (1) a sale of substantially all the assets of the wireless group, (2) a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving all or substantially all of the business of the wireless group, (3) certain acquisitions of businesses or assets to be contributed to at&t wireless for aggregate consideration in excess of $17 billion, (4) issuances of economic interests representing in excess of 15% of the economic interests in the wireless group, subject to certain exceptions,(5) payment of cash dividends on or repurchases of wireless group common stock and (6) certain (a) amendments to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of at&t to the extent such amendments would have an adverse effect on the new tracking stock, (b) changes to the draft separation and distribution agreements prepared in connection with the spin-off that would have a material adverse effect on the wireless group and (c) material new agreements between at&t or its subsidiaries on the one hand and the wireless group and its subsidiaries on the other hand. liquidation. under the terms of the new tracking stock, the new tracking stock will be entitled to an aggregate liquidation preference of $3.65 billion in the event of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of at&t. in the event of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of at&t, the new tracking stock would convert into wireless group common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. registration rights. under the investor agreement, docomo is entitled to piggy-back registration rights and up to six registration demands, provided the aggregate value of
