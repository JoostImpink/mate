common stock that are the subject of this statement are to be acquired from the issuer pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated august 14, 1997, between the issuer and prometheus (the "stock purchase agreement"). while prometheus has not obtained actual, record ownership of the shares of common stock reported by this statement, prometheus may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock reported herein upon the signing of the stock purchase agreement as a result of prometheus' binding commitment to acquire the shares of preferred stock and warrants, each convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, in accordance with the stock purchase agreement, subject to only limited conditions. subject to the terms and conditions of the stock purchase agreement, the issuer shall sell to prometheus (i) an aggregate of 35,000 shares of class aa preferred stock, (ii) an aggregate of 40,000 shares of class ab preferred stock apportioned between class abi convertible redeemable preferred stock and class abii preferred stock as described below and (iii) an aggregate of 1,000,000 warrants. upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement (the "transaction"), prometheus shall beneficially own 35,000 shares of class aa preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $35,000,000. holders of the class aa preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters voted on by holders of common stock, voting together with the common stock as a single class (together with all other classes and series of stock of the company that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock) at all meetings of the stockholders of the company and each share of class aa preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of class aa preferred stock is convertible based on the mandatory conversion price (as defined in the class aa certificate of designations attached hereto as exhibit 6 and incorporated herein by reference) (with such vote to remain constant, even though the conversion rate changes pursuant to the terms thereunder). dividends shall accrue cumulatively at 6% per annum and compound quarterly on the aggregate liquidation value of the class aa preferred stock then outstanding, payable quarterly in arrears. class aa preferred stock is convertible at any time after the date of its issuance, at the holder's option, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments, as set forth in the class aa certificate of designations. notwithstanding the above, the class aa preferred stock may be converted, at the company's option, into common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share when the average of the closing prices of the common stock, for the 90 days preceding conversion, is equal to or exceeds $12.00 per share. prometheus also shall beneficially own 40,000 shares of class ab preferred stock, consisting of series abi preferred stock and abii preferred stock, with an aggregate liquidation value of $40,000,000. holders of the class abi preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters voted on by the holders of common stock, voting together with the common stock as a single class (together with all page 6 of 12 other classes and series of stock of the company that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock) at all meetings of the stockholders of the company and each share of class abi preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of class abi preferred stock is convertible based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the date immediately preceding the initial issue date (as defined in the class abi certificate of designations) (with such vote to remain constant, even though the conversion rate changes pursuant to the terms thereunder). holders of class abii preferred stock are entitled to vote on all matters voted on by the holders of common stock, voting together with the common stock as a single class (together with all other classes and series of stock of the company that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock) at all meetings of the stockholders of the company other than in respect of the election of directors (provided that the class abii shall vote in the election of directors if (i) the price of the common stock (as measured by the current market price (as defined in the class abii certificate of designations)) is less than $3.00 per share (such amount to be adjusted for stock splits and recombinations as appropriate) and (ii) the holder provides notice to the company that it elects to obtain such voting right) and each share of class abii preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of class abii preferred stock is convertible based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the immediately preceding initial issue date (as defined in the class abii certificate of designations) (with such vote to remain constant, even though the conversion rate changes pursuant to the terms thereunder). dividends shall accrue cumulatively at 12% per annum and compound quarterly on the aggregate liquidation value of the class ab preferred stock then outstanding, payable quarterly in arrears. class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock are convertible at any time on or after the fourth anniversary after the approval date (as defined in the class abi and class abii certificates of designations), at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the average of the closing prices of the company's common stock for the thirty consecutive trading days commencing forty-five consecutive trading days before the applicable conversion date (the "conversion price"), as set forth in the class abi and class abii certificates of designations attached hereto as exhibits 7 and 8, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. at the option of the issuer on or after the fifth anniversary of the approval date, the issuer, at its option, may convert all, but not less than all, of the aggregate shares of class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock into common stock at the conversion price. the class ab preferred stock may be redeemed, in whole, but not in part, at any time after five years from the initial issue date, at the option of the company. prometheus shall receive an aggregate of 1,000,000 warrants exercisable for shares of common stock at an exercise price per share equal to $7.00. at any time following the fourth anniversary of the approval date but prior to the sixth anniversary of the approval date, the holder shall have the option to adjust the exercise price per share and the number of shares for which the warrants are exercisable as set forth in the warrant agreement attached as exhibit 5 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. all warrants are exercisable between the second and seventh anniversary of the execution of the warrant agreement. at the option of the holder, the warrants may be exercised by applying the value of shares of common stock otherwise receivable by the holder upon exercise in payment of the exercise price. the transaction will be consummated in three or more stages. on september 30, 1997, prometheus will purchase from the issuer (i) such number of shares of class abi preferred stock, up to 15,000 shares, as may be issued by the issuer without resulting in prometheus having more than 19.9% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer's capital stock and (ii) 375,000 warrants (the "first closing"). on december 30, 1997, prometheus shall purchase from the issuer (i) 16,333 shares of class aa preferred stock, (ii) the number of shares of class ab preferred stock equal to 18,667 less the number of shares of class ab preferred stock issued in the first closing, apportioned between the class abi preferred stock and the class abii preferred stock such that prometheus has no more than 45% of the total voting power of the issuer but so that the issuer shall issue the maximum amount of class abi preferred stock it is permitted to issue before issuing any class abii preferred stock and (iii) 625,000 warrants (the "second closing"). following the second closing, the issuer shall be obligated to sell to prometheus at one or more subsequent closings (the "subsequent purchases") an aggregate of 18,667 shares of class aa preferred stock and 21,333 shares of class ab preferred stock apportioned between the class abi preferred stock and the class abii preferred stock as set forth above. the issuer shall give prometheus notice of at least twenty business days of any subsequent closing and shall require prometheus to purchase no fewer than page 7 of 12 10,000 shares of preferred stock. the issuer shall require prometheus to make all of the subsequent purchases on or before december 31, 1998. the first closing is subject to various conditions, including (i) the option of prometheus to terminate the transaction within five business days of the satisfaction by the issuer of its disclosure obligations set forth in the stock purchase agreement, (ii) the taking of all actions necessary to accomplish the election of directors as described in the stockholders agreement, (iii) the entering into by the issuer of the other ancillary documents, and (iv) the satisfaction of various other customary closing conditions. the second closing and the closings of all subsequent purchases will be subject to the above conditions as well as stockholder approval of all items necessary to effectuate the transactions as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement and ancillary documents. if such stockholder approval for the second closing has not been obtained by december 30, 1997, the issuer may, at its option, extend the date of the second closing until january 31, 1998. the issuer may agree to sell to prometheus, on the same terms as the previous sales, up to an additional (i) 11,667 shares of class aa preferred stock, (ii) 13,333 shares of class ab preferred stock and (iii) 333,250 warrants (collectively, the "additional securities"). in addition, certain existing shareholders (the "shareholders") of the company may agree to sell to prometheus approximately 900,000 shares of common stock for approximately $4.9 million. because neither the issuer, the shareholders, nor prometheus are under any obligation to engage in the purchase or sale of additional securities, the reporting persons disclaim beneficial ownership of such additional shares of common stock subject to such future transactions. moreover, the warrants to be issued pursuant to the stock purchase agreement are not exercisable until 1999 and the series abii preferred stock does not vote in the election of directors and is not convertible into common stock until 2001. therefore, the reporting persons disclaim beneficial ownership of any common stock into which the warrants are exercisable or the series abii preferred stock are convertible subject to future transactions. the foregoing discussion of the stock purchase agreement is qualified in its entirety to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached as exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by reference. see also item 6. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) assuming consummation of the sale by the company of all shares issuable pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, the conversion of the 35,000 shares class aa preferred stock into common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share for 5,833,333 shares of common stock and the conversion of approximately 19,500 shares of the class abi preferred stock into common stock at an assumed conversion price equal to $5.00 per share for approximately 3,900,000 shares of common stock, such 9,733,333 shares would represent approximately 45.0% of the approximately 21,578,608 issued and outstanding shares of the issuer, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of june 30, 1997, as disclosed in the company's most recent filing on form 10-q/a (assuming further, based on a conversion price of $6.00 per share for the series aa preferred stock and an assumed conversion price of $5.00 per share for the series ab preferred stock, (i) the consummation of the sale to prometheus of the additional securities for 4,944,350 shares of common stock, (ii) the purchase of approximately 900,000 shares of common stock from the shareholders, (iii) the conversion of the remaining 20,500 shares of series abii preferred stock for 4,100,000 shares of common stock and (iv) the exercise of the warrants for 1,000,000 shares of common stock, each of which the reporting persons disclaim beneficial ownership in item 4, such 20,677,833 shares would represent approximately 63.6% of the approximately 32,522,958 issued and outstanding shares of the issuer). the calculations of the interest in securities are based on assumed conversion and exercise prices and do not take into consideration any adjustments to such conversions and exercise prices. please see item 4 and the terms set forth in the series aa, series abi and series abii certificates of designations attached hereto as exhibits 6 through 8, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference and the warrant agreement attached hereto as exhibit 5 and incorporated herein by reference. (b) prometheus has the sole power to vote or to direct the vote of all shares of common stock covered by this statement, subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement described in item 6. page 8 of 12 (c) neither the reporting persons nor, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the parties listed on schedule 1 hereto have acquired any shares of common stock of the company during the past sixty days, other than the purchases reported herein. (d) prometheus has the sole right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds of sale of, the shares of common stock covered by this statement. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings, or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. concurrently with the execution of the stock purchase agreement, prometheus and certain individuals (named below) entered into a stockholders' voting agreement (the "stockholders' voting agreement"). pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, on september 30, 1997 (the date of the first closing), prometheus and the issuer shall enter into a warrant agreement (the "warrant agreement"); prometheus, the issuer and the stockholders named therein shall enter into a stockholders agreement (the "stockholders agreement"); and prometheus and the issuer shall enter into a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement;" and, collectively with the stockholders' voting agreement, the warrant agreement and the stockholders agreement, the "ancillary documents"). the stockholders agreement contemplates that the issuer will take all action necessary to cause (i) the board to be structured to consist of fifteen members (subject to increase in the case of an adverse event (as defined in the stockholders agreement)), (ii) the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, to have the exclusive right to elect a minimum of three directors (each such director, a "preferred stock director"), (iii) any increases in the size of the board to result in an increase in the number of preferred stock directors such that they represent at least 20% of the votes exercisable by the board and (iv) at least a proportionate number of preferred stock directors to serve on each committee of the board (provided that the executive committee shall consist of five members of which two members shall be preferred stock directors) and at least one preferred stock director to serve on the governing body of each of the issuer's subsidiaries and affiliates, other than operational home building companies. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, under certain circumstances prometheus will have the right to participate in the issuance or sale by the company of any shares of its capital stock so that prometheus can maintain its proportionate share of outstanding capital stock of the company. in addition, prometheus will have certain tag- along rights if the executive shareholders (as defined in the stockholders agreement) sell their beneficial interest in the common stock. in the event of an adverse event, the holders of class aa preferred stock and class ab preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to elect sufficient preferred stock directors to constitute a majority of the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors. the size of the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors shall be automatically increased in order to effect any such additional directors. this right shall continue until such time as the conditions giving rise to the adverse effect are no longer in effect for two consecutive quarters, as further described in the certificates of designations of the preferred stock. neither the issuer nor its subsidiaries shall take certain actions without the affirmative vote of over eighty-one percent of either (i) the directors or (ii) the members of a five member executive committee established under the stockholders agreement. the certificate of incorporation and bylaws page 9 of 12 of the issuer and its subsidiaries shall be amended to give effect to the terms of the stockholders agreement. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the issuer has granted prometheus demand registration rights to facilitate the resale of the common stock owned by it and has also granted prometheus certain piggyback rights to sell a portion of its shares in connection with offerings of securities by the issuer for its own account. pursuant to the warrant agreement, the company will grant to prometheus warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of one million shares of common stock, subject to adjustment. the warrants will be exercisable commencing on the second anniversary and ending on the seventh anniversary of the warrant agreement, at the exercise prices set forth therein. pursuant to the stockholders' voting agreement, the following stockholders of the company have agreed to vote their voting shares of capital stock for the transactions as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement: j. marshall coleman, james j. martell, jr., robert r. short, j. christopher stuhmer, thomas buffington, lawrence j. witek, lanold w. caldwell, james m. gidden, edward a. kirkpatrick and patricia a. donnelly. this agreement shall terminate at the second closing. each stockholder agrees not to

to circumstances that do not pertain to an alleged breach of this agreement), and the determination as to whether indemnification pursuant to such other source is available shall be made in accordance

(b) underwriter's cutback. --------------------- subject to the requirements of section 11 hereof, if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter of such offering the inclusion of all of the shares of registrable securities and any other common stock requested to be registered would interfere with the successful marketing of a smaller number of such shares, then the number of shares of registrable securities and other common stock to be included in the offering (except for shares of registrable securities to be included in a demand registration in accordance with section 2 hereof) shall be reduced to such smaller number with the participation in such offering to be in the following order of priority: (1) first, the shares of registrable securities requested to be included, and (2) second, any other shares of common stock requested to be included. any necessary allocation among the holders of shares within each of the 5 foregoing groups shall be pro rata among such holders requesting such registration based upon the number of shares of common stock and registrable securities owned by such holders. all shares so excluded from the underwritten public offering shall be withheld from the market by the holders thereof for a period (not to exceed 30 days prior to the effective date and 75 days thereafter) that the managing underwriter reasonably determines is necessary in order to effect the underwritten public offering. (c) company control. --------------- the company may decline to file a registration statement after giving notice to any holder pursuant to section 3(a) above, or withdraw a registration statement after filing and after such notice, but prior to the effectiveness thereof, provided that the company shall promptly notify each holder in writing of any such action and provided further that the company shall bear all expenses incurred by such holder or otherwise in connection with such withdrawn registration statement. 4. hold-back agreements. -------------------- (a) by holders of registrable securities. ------------------------------------ upon the written request of the managing underwriter of any underwritten offering of the company's securities, a holder of registrable securities shall not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities (other than those included in such registration) without the prior written consent of such managing underwriter for a period (not to exceed 30 days before the effective date and 75 days thereafter) that such managing underwriter reasonably determines is necessary in order to effect the underwritten public offering; provided that each of the officers and directors of the company shall have entered into substantially similar holdback agreements with such managing underwriter covering at least the same period.

(b) indemnification procedures. -------------------------- if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation or inquiry) shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified holder in respect of which indemnity may be sought 11 from the company, such indemnified holder shall promptly notify the company in writing, and the company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified holder and the payment of all expenses. such indemnified holder shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be the expense of such indemnified holder unless (i) the company has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the company shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or proceeding or has failed to employ counsel satisfactory to such indemnified holder in any such action or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified holder and the company, and such indemnified holder shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified holder that are different from or additional to those available to the company. if such indemnified holder notifies the company in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the company as permitted by the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified holder. the foregoing notwithstanding, the company shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for such indemnified holder and any other indemnified holders (which firm shall be designated in writing by such indemnified holders) in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. the company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified holders from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (c) indemnification by holder of registrable securities. --------------------------------------------------- each holder of registrable securities agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to such holder, but only with respect to information relating to such holder furnished in writing by such holder expressly for use in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. in no event, however, shall the liability hereunder of any selling holder of registrable securities be greater than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. in case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the company or its directors or officers or any such controlling person, in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a holder of registrable securities, such holder shall have the rights and duties given the company and the company or its directors or officers or such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each holder by sections 7(a) and 7(b) above. 12 the company shall be entitled to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with respect to information so furnished in writing by such persons specifically for inclusion in any prospectus or registration statement. (d) contribution. ------------ if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under section 7(a) or section 7(c) above (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those sections) in respect of any claims referred to in such sections, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the indemnified holder on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such claims as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the claims referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 7(b), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the indemnified holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the misstatement or alleged misstatement relates to information supplied by the company or by the indemnified holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such misstatement or alleged misstatement. the company and each holder of registrable securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 7(d), an indemnified holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (i) the total price at which the securities that were sold by such indemnified holder and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds (ii) the amount of any damages which such indemnified holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such misstatement. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8. exchange act reporting requirements. ----------------------------------- from and after the date hereof, the company shall (whether or not it

securities (i) a written statement by the company that it has complied with such reporting requirements, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and (iii) such other reports and documents filed by the company with the commission as such holder may reasonably request in availing itself of an exemption for the sale of registrable securities without registration under the securities act. the purpose of the foregoing requirements are (x) to enable any such holder to comply with the current public information requirements contained in paragraph (c) of rule 144 under the securities act (or any successor provision) and (y) to qualify the company for the use of registration statements on form s- 3. 9. requirements for participation in underwritten offerings.

securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 10. suspension of sales. ------------------- upon receipt of written notice from the company that a registration statement or prospectus contains a misstatement, each holder of registrable securities shall forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable securities until such holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus required by section 5(1) hereof, or until such holder is advised in writing by the company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and, if so directed by the company, such holder shall deliver to the company (at the company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. 11. future registration rights agreements. ------------------------------------- except for an underwriting agreement between the company and one or more professional underwriters of securities, the company shall not agree after the date hereof to register any equity securities under the securities act unless such agreement specifically provides that: (a) the holder of such equity securities may not participate in any demand registration without the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of the registrable securities included in such registration unless: (i) the offering of the registrable securities is to be a firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter concludes that the public offering or sale 14 of such equity securities would not interfere with the successful marketing of all registrable securities requested to be sold and (ii) the holders of registrable securities shall have the right to participate, to the extent they may request, in any registration statement initiated under a demand registration right exercised by the holder of such equity securities, except that if the managing underwriter of a public offering made pursuant to such a demand registration limits the number of shares of common stock to be sold,

(a) each of the executive shareholders ---------------- agrees that (i) from the date hereof through the third anniversary of the date hereof he shall not transfer, whether in a single transaction or in a series of linked transactions, more than ten percent (10%) per year, when aggregated with all such other transfers made by such shareholder in such year, of the common stock beneficially owned by him on the date hereof and (ii) from the third anniversary of the date hereof through the fourth anniversary of the date hereof he shall not transfer, whether in a single transaction or in a series of linked transactions, more than five percent (5%), when aggregated with all such other transfers made by such shareholder during such period, of the common stock beneficially owned by him on the date hereof, unless, the terms and conditions of such transfer shall include an offer to the purchaser to include in the transfer to the proposed transferee (the "third party"), at the purchaser's option and on the same price and on the same terms and conditions as apply to the executive shareholder, an amount of preferred stock and common stock held by the purchaser determined in accordance with this section 5.1. each of the homebuilder shareholders agrees that from and after the date hereof, he shall not transfer, whether in a single transaction or in a series of linked transactions, more than fifty percent (50%), when aggregated with all such other transfers made by such shareholder, of the common stock then beneficially owned by him, unless the terms and conditions of such transfer shall include an offer to the purchaser to include in the transfer to the third party at the purchaser's option and on the same price and on the same terms and conditions as apply to the homebuilder shareholder, an amount of preferred stock and common stock determined in accordance with this section 5.1. the third party shall be required to purchase from the purchaser, if the purchaser desires to participate in such transaction, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the purchaser equaling the lesser of (x) the number derived by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of common stock which the third party proposes to purchase by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the purchaser and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the purchaser and the applicable selling shareholder or (y) such lesser number of shares as the purchaser shall designate in the tag- along notice (defined below). if the tag-along right results in the purchaser including more shares of common stock beneficially owned by him in any tag-along notice, than will, on the date of transfer by the purchaser to the third party, have been converted into common stock, the purchaser and the company shall take such steps as are reasonably required to convert to common stock any preferred stock to be purchased by the third party (at the prevailing conversion price(s) for the preferred stock being sold by the selling shareholder) which the purchaser desires to transfer immediately prior to such 13 transfer and contingent upon such transfer occurring, it being the parties' intention that only common stock will be transferred to the third party pursuant to this section 5.1. the selling shareholder shall notify the company and the purchaser of any proposed transfer to which the provisions of this section 5.1 apply. each such notice shall set forth: (i) the name of the third party and the number of shares of common stock proposed to be transferred, (ii) the address of the third party, (iii) the proposed amount and form of consideration and terms and conditions of payment offered by the third party, and any other material terms pertaining to the transfer (the "third party terms") and (iv) that the third party has been informed of the "tag-along rights" provided for in this section 5.1 and has agreed to purchase shares of common stock in accordance with the terms hereof. the tag-along rights set forth above in this section 5.1 may be exercised by the purchaser by delivery of a written notice to the company and the selling shareholder (the "tag-along notice") within thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice specified in the preceding paragraph. the tag- along notice shall state the number of shares of common stock that the purchaser wishes to include in such transfer to the third party. upon the giving of a tag-along notice, the purchaser shall be entitled and obligated to sell the number of shares of common stock set forth in the tag- along notice to the third party on the third party terms; provided, however, -------- ------- that neither the selling shareholder nor the purchaser shall consummate the sale of any shares offered by it if the third party does not purchase all shares which the selling shareholder and the purchaser are entitled and desire to sell pursuant hereto. after expiration of the thirty-day period referred to above, if the provisions of this section have been complied with in all respects, the selling shareholder shall have the right for a sixty (60)-day period to transfer the shares of common stock to the third party on the third party terms (or on other terms no more favorable to the selling shareholder) without further notice to the purchaser, but after such sixty (60)-day period no such transfer may be made without again giving notice to the purchaser of the proposed transfer and complying with the requirements of this section 5.1. (b) at the closing of the transfer to any third party (of which the selling shareholder shall give the purchaser who has elected to exercise the tag-along right provided by this section 5.1 at least five (5) business days' prior written notice), the third party shall remit to the purchaser the consideration for the total sales price of the common stock of the purchaser sold pursuant thereto, against delivery by the purchaser of certificates for such common stock, duly endorsed or with duly executed stock powers and the compliance by such shareholder with any other conditions to closing generally applicable to the selling shareholder and all other shareholders selling shares in such transaction.

provided, however, that in the event that the -------- ------- determination by the majority of the non-preferred stock directors is more than 110% of the price determined by the investment banking firm, then the costs incurred by such investment banking firm shall be borne by the warrant holders who challenged such price. each warrant not exercised prior to 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on [seventh anniversary] shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this agreement shall cease as of such time. no adjustments as to dividends will be made upon exercise of the warrants. for purposes hereof, "non-preferred stock directors" means directors of the company excluding any director elected to the board of directors by the holders of the preferred stock voting as a separate class. on or after [ ], 2001, and on or before [ ], 2003 (the "adjustment period"), a holder of warrants may elect to adjust up to five (5) times per year (i) the exercise price of each 2 warrant and (ii) the number of shares of common stock into which each warrant held by such holder shall convert upon exercise of the warrants ("additional shares"), by reference to the average of the quoted price of the common stock for the [60 days] preceding such adjustment (the "adjustment price"). upon such election the company will deliver a new warrant certificate to reflect the revised exercise price and number of shares into which such warrant is convertible. notwithstanding this, any such adjustments to the exercise prices and adjustment prices shall take effect immediately upon any warrant holder electing any such adjustments. adjustment price ($) exercise price ($) additional shares per warrant -------------------- ------------------ ----------------------------- 20.01 or greater 7.00 0.00 17.51 - 20.00 7.00 0.33 15.01 - 17.50 7.00 0.667 12.01 - 15.00 7.00 1.00 10.01 - 12.00 6.50 1.25 8.01 - 10.00 6.00 1.50 6.01 - 8.00 5.00 1.75 4.01 - 6.00 4.00 2.00 2.01 - 4.00 3.00 2.25 0.00 - 2.00 2.00 2.50 for purposes of illustration, if the common stock price is $9.00 per share, the total number of warrant shares will be 2,500,000. if any adjustment to the exercise price is made pursuant to section 10 hereof, the adjustment prices shall be adjusted in like manner as set forth in section 10 hereof. the exercise prices set forth above are subject to the adjustments set forth in section 10 hereto. if during the adjustment period it is possible for a holder of warrants to adjust the exercise price and such holder elects to do so, he must inform the company in writing of such election. the company will then be obligated to notify such electing holder and all other holders of warrants in writing within three (3) business days of receipt of the election by the holder of the new exercise price for such holder's warrants and/or the number of additional shares to which such holder is entitled. such new exercise price and such entitlement to additional shares shall remain the exercise price and such entitlement to additional shares for such warrants until such time, if any, as the then holder elects to re-adjust the exercise price and such entitlement to additional shares of the warrants then held by such holder. if any other holder of warrants, upon receipt of a 3 notice from the company, wishes to adjust the exercise price in respect of the warrants held by him, he may do so by notifying the company accordingly in writing within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the company. upon such notification in writing, the exercise price of warrants and the number of additional shares for which such warrants may be exercised shall be adjusted by the company with effect from the date of his receipt of notification from the company notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, in the event that the stock purchase agreement is terminated (other than as a result of a default by the purchaser of its obligations under the stock purchase agreement), the exercise price of each warrant shall immediately be adjusted to one cent ($0.01). a warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the company at its office designated for such purpose (the address of which is set forth in section 14 hereof) of the certificate or certificates evidencing the warrants to be exercised with the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed, which signature shall be guaranteed by a bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the united states or a broker or dealer which is a member of a registered securities exchange or the national association of securities dealers, inc.

(a) if the company: (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that each holder of a warrant thereafter converted may receive the number of shares of capital stock of the company which he would have owned immediately following such action if he had exercised such warrant immediately prior to such action. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date of a subdivision, 6 combination or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. if, after an adjustment referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of a warrant upon exercise of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the company, the company shall determine the allocation of the adjusted conversion prices between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the exercise price of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this section 10(a). (b) if the company distributes any rights or warrants to all holders of its common stock entitling them to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share on the record date mentioned below, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: nxp --- c'= c x o + m ----- o + n ----- where: c' = the adjusted exercise price. c = the then current exercise price. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. n = the number of additional shares of common stock offered. p = the offering price per share of the additional shares of common stock. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights or warrants. if at the end of the period during which such rights or warrants are exercisable, not all rights or warrants shall have been exercised, the exercise price shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "n" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. (c) if the company distributes to all holders of shares of its common stock (i) any shares of any class of capital stock of the company other than its common stock, (ii) any evidence of indebtedness or other securities of the company or any subsidiary of the company, (iii) any other assets of the company or any subsidiary of the company (other than cash), (iv) 7 distributions in cash in excess of three percent (3%) of net earnings before extraordinary items or (v) any rights, options or warrants to acquire any of the foregoing (other than rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10(b) above), the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: c'= c x m - f ----- m where: c' = the adjusted exercise price. c = the then current exercise price. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date mentioned below. f = the fair market value on the record date of the capital stock, securities, indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants applicable to one share of common stock or if the adjustment pursuant to this section 10(c) being made in respect of a cash dividend, the total amount of cash to be distributed at such time to holders of common stock. the board of directors of the company shall determine the fair market value. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. (d) if the company issues shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price per share on the date the company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: p - c'= c x o + m ----- a where: c' = the adjusted exercise price. c = the then current exercise price. 8 o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such additional shares. m = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such additional shares. a = the number of shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. this section 10(d) does not apply to (i) any transaction or issuance described in section 10(b) or section 10(c) above or section 10(e) below, (ii) the conversion of class aa preferred stock, class ab preferred stock, series a preferred stock, series b preferred stock, series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or the conversion, exchange or exercise of other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock whose issuance was subject to an adjustment pursuant to section 10(b) or section 10(c) above or section 10(e) below, (iii) common stock issued to the company's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors of the company and approved by the holders of common stock when required by law, if such common stock would otherwise be covered by this section 10(d) (but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby (together with the aggregate number of shares issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of the securities excluded by clause (iii) of section 10(e) below) and issued after the initial issue date shall not exceed 5% of the common stock outstanding at the time of any such issuance), (iv) common stock issued to acquire, or in the acquisition of, all or any portion of a business, in an arm's-length transaction between the company and an unaffiliated third party, whether such acquisition shall be effected by purchase of assets, exchange of securities, merger, consolidation or otherwise, or (v) common stock issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting. (e) if the company issues any options, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock (other than class aa preferred stock, class ab preferred stock, series a preferred stock, series b preferred stock, series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or securities issued in transactions described in section 10(b) or section 10(c) above) and for a consideration per share of common stock initially deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities less than the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other securities, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: p - c'= c x o + m ----- 9 o + d where: c' = the adjusted exercise price. c = the then current exercise price. o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such securities. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such securities. m = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such securities. d = the maximum number of shares deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for or upon exercise of such securities at the initial conversion, exchange or exercise rate. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. if all of the common stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities has not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then the exercise price shall promptly be readjusted to the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities. this section 10(e) does not apply to (i) the issuance of any such securities to acquire, or in the acquisition of, all or any portion of a business, in an arm's-length transaction between the company and an unaffiliated third party, whether such acquisition shall be effected by purchase of assets, exchange of securities, merger, consolidation or otherwise, (ii) the issuance of any such securities in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, or (iii) the issuance of any such securities to the company's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors of the company and approved by the holders of common stock when required by law, if such securities would otherwise by covered by this section 10(e) (but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of the aggregate number of securities excluded hereby (together with the aggregate number of shares excluded by clause (iii) of section 10(d) above) and issued after the initial issue date shall not exceed 5% of the common stock outstanding at the time of any such issuance). the reduction shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the expiration time. (f) current market price. -------------------- 10 in sections 10(b)-(e) the current market price per share of common stock on any date is the average of the quoted prices of the common stock for 30 consecutive trading days commencing 45 trading days before the date in question (the "current market price"). "trading day" means, with respect to any security, any day on which any market in which the applicable security is then traded and in which a quoted price may be ascertained is open for business. the "quoted price" means, with respect to common stock, the last reported sales price for common stock as reported by the nasd automatic quotations system, national market system, or, if the common stock is listed or admitted for trading on a securities exchange, the last reported sales price of the common stock on the principal exchange on which the common stock is listed or admitted for trading (which shall be for consolidated trading if applicable to such exchange), or if not so reported or listed or admitted for trading, the last reported bid price of the applicable security in the over-the-counter market. in the event that the quoted price cannot be determined as aforesaid, the board of directors of the company shall determine the quoted price on the basis of such quotations as it in good faith considers appropriate. such determination may be challenged in good faith by a majority of holders of shares of preferred stock, and any dispute shall be resolved at the company's cost, by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the company and acceptable to such holders of convertible preferred stock and shall be made in good faith and be conclusive absent manifest error provided, however, if the -------- ------- quoted price as determined by the board of directors of the company is more than 110% of the price determined by the investment banking firm, then the costs incurred by such investment banking firm shall be borne by the warrant holders who challenged such price. (g) consideration received. ---------------------- for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to sections 10(d)-(e), the following shall apply: (i) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the company for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; (ii) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors, (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof); (iii) in the case of the issuance of options, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares, the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for the issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion, 11 exchange or exercise thereof (the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this section) (h) no adjustment in the exercise price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the exercise price. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. (i) to the extent the warrants become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. interest will not accrue on the cash. (j) whenever the exercise price is adjusted, the company shall provide the notices required by section 13 hereof. (k) the company from time to time may reduce the exercise price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period but in no event may the exercise price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the exercise price is reduced, the company shall mail to warrant holders a notice of the reduction first class, postage prepaid. the company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced exercise price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced exercise price and the period it will be in effect. a reduction of the exercise price does not change or adjust the exercise price otherwise in effect for purposes of sections 10(a)-(e). (l) if: (i) the company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the exercise price pursuant to sections 10(a)-(e) and if the company does not arrange for warrant holders to participate pursuant to section 10(g); (ii) the company takes any action that would require a supplemental warrant agreement pursuant to section 10(m); or (iii) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the company, the company shall mail to warrant holders a notice stating the proposed record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, lease, liquidation or dissolution. the company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before such date. failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction. (m) if the company consolidates or merges with or into, or transfers or leases all or substantially all its assets to, any person, upon consummation of such transaction the warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or 12 other assets which the holder of a warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if the holder had exercised the warrant immediately before the effective date of the transaction. concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the company formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the company, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental warrant agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this section. the successor company shall mail to warrant holders a notice describing the supplemental warrant agreement. if the issuer of securities deliverable upon exercise of warrants under the supplemental warrant agreement is an affiliate of the formed, surviving, transferee or lessee company, that issuer shall join in the supplemental warrant agreement. if this section 10(m) applies, sections 10(a)-(e) do not apply. (n) in addition, in the event that any other transaction or event occurs to which the foregoing exercise price adjustment provisions are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment would adversely affect the rights represented by the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then, in each such case, the company shall appoint an investment banking firm of recognized national standing, or any other financial expert that does not (or whose directors, officers, employees, affiliates or stockholders do not) have a direct or material indirect financial interest in the company or any of its subsidiaries, who has not been, and, at the time it is called upon to give independent financial advice to the company, is not (and none of its directors, officer, employees, affiliates or stockholders are) a promoter, director or officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, which will give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in the foregoing exercise price adjustment provisions, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the rights represented by the warrants. upon receipt of such opinion or determination, the company shall promptly mail a copy thereof to the warrant holders and will make the adjustments described therein. (o) except as provided in the immediately following sentence, any determination that the company or its board of directors must make pursuant to section 10 shall be conclusive. whenever the company, its board of directors or the non-preferred stock directors shall be required to make a determination under this section 10, such determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith by the holders of a majority of warrants and any dispute shall be resolved at the company's expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the company and acceptable to such warrant holders; provided, however, that in the event the -------- ------- determination by the board of directors of the company is more than 110% of the price determined by the investment banking firm, then the costs incurred by such investment banking firm shall be borne by the warrant holders who challenged such price. 13 (p) in any case in which this section 10 shall require that an adjustment in the exercise price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the holder of any warrant exercised after such record date the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the warrant shares and other capital stock of the company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the exercise price and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share pursuant to section 11; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to -------- ------- such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional warrant shares, other capital stock and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (q) upon each adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to this section 10, each warrant outstanding prior to the making of the adjustment in the exercise price shall thereafter evidence the right to receive upon payment of the adjusted exercise price that number of shares of common stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth) obtained from the following formula: n' = n x (e/e') where: n' = the adjusted number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant by payment of the adjusted exercise price. n = the number or warrant shares previously issuable upon exercise of a warrant by payment of the exercise price prior to adjustment. e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the exercise price prior to adjustment. (r) irrespective of any adjustments in the exercise price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants, warrants therefore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the warrants initially issuable pursuant to this agreement. section 11. fractional interests. the company shall not be required to -------------------- issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, except for the provisions of this section 11, be issuable on the exercise of any warrants (or specified portion thereof), the company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the exercise price on the day immediately preceding the date the warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction. 14 section 12. financial statements. -------------------- (a) whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission (the "commission"), so long as any of the warrants remain outstanding, the company shall furnish to the warrant holder (i) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the commission on forms 10-q and 10-k if the company were required to file such forms, including "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by the company's certified independent accountants and (ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the commission on form 8-k if the company were required to file such reports. in addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the commission, the company shall file a copy of all such information and reports with the commission for public availability (unless the commission will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request. in addition, for so long as any warrant remains outstanding, the company shall furnish to the warrant holder and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to rule 144a(d)(4) under the securities act. (b) the company shall, so long as any of the warrants are outstanding, deliver to the warrant holder, forthwith upon any executive officer of the company becoming aware of any default under this agreement, an officers' certificate specifying such default and what action the company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. section 13. notices to warrant holder. upon any adjustment of the ------------------------- exercise price pursuant to section 10, the company shall promptly thereafter (i) cause to be filed with the company a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing selected by the board of directors of the company (who may be the regular auditors of the company) setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculations are based and setting forth the number of warrant shares (or portion thereof) issuable after such adjustment in the exercise price, upon exercise of a warrant and payment of the adjusted exercise price, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the matters set forth therein, and (ii) cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the warrant certificates at his address appearing on the warrant register written notice of such adjustments by first- class mail, postage prepaid. where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this section 13. in case: (a) the company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of shares of common stock of rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or of any other subscription rights or warrants;

(b) (i) to convert class aa preferred stock pursuant to subparagraph 4(a)(i), a holder must (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of class aa preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed in a form satisfactory to the corporation, at the office of the corporation or transfer agent for the class aa preferred stock, (ii) notify the corporation at such office that he elects to convert class aa preferred stock, and the number of shares he wishes to convert, (iii) state in writing the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued, and (iv) pay any transfer or similar tax if required (provided, however, that no such payment shall be required if the common stock issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the converting holder of class aa preferred stock). in the case of lost or destroyed certificates evidencing ownership of shares of class aa preferred stock to be surrendered for conversion, the holder shall submit proof of loss or destruction, and such indemnity as shall be reasonably required by the corporation. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of class aa preferred stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "optional conversion date." as soon as practical and in any event within five (5) business days of the optional conversation date, the corporation shall deliver through the transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion, a check for any fractional share and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of class aa preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the optional conversion date. all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the class aa preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall rank pari passu with the other shares of common stock outstanding from ---- ----- time to time. in the case of class aa preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the holder of such class aa preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of subparagraph 4(a)). holders of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the optional conversion date. if a holder of class aa preferred stock converts more than one share at a time the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total value of all shares of class aa preferred stock converted. if during the adjustment period it is 9 possible for a holder of class aa preferred stock to adjust the optional conversion price and such holder elects to do so, he must inform the corporation in writing of such election. the corporation will then be obligated to notify such electing holder and all other holders of class aa preferred stock in writing within three (3) business days of receipt of the election by the holder of the new optional conversion price for such holder's class aa preferred stock. such new optional conversion price shall remain the optional conversion price for such class aa preferred stock until such time, if any, as the then holder elects to re-adjust the optional conversion price of the class aa preferred stock then held by such holder. if any other holder of class aa preferred stock, upon receipt of a notice from the corporation, wishes to adjust the optional conversion price in respect of the class aa preferred stock held by him, he may do so by notifying the corporation accordingly in writing within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the corporation. upon such notification in writing, the optional conversion price of his shares of class aa preferred stock shall be adjusted by the corporation with effect from the date of his receipt of notification from the corporation.

(d) if a holder converts shares of class aa preferred stock, the corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of common stock upon the conversion. however, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder's name. (e) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury enough shares of common stock to permit the conversion of the class aa preferred stock in full. all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of class aa preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation will endeavor to comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of class aa preferred stock and will endeavor to list such shares on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed. (f) if the corporation: (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the conversion prices in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that each holder of class aa preferred stock thereafter converted may receive the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which he would have owned immediately following such action if he had converted class aa preferred stock immediately prior to such action. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. if, after an adjustment referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of class aa preferred stock upon conversion of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the corporation, the corporation shall determine the allocation of the adjusted conversion prices between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, 11 the conversion prices of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this subparagraph (f). (g) if the corporation distributes any rights or warrants to all holders of its common stock entitling them to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share on the record date mentioned below, each of the conversion prices shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: nxp --- c'= c x o + m ----- o + n where: c' = the adjusted conversion price. c = the then current conversion price. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. n = the number of additional shares of common stock offered. p = the offering price per share of the additional shares of common stock. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights or warrants. if at the end of the period during which such warrants or rights are exercisable, not all warrants or rights shall have been exercised, the conversion prices shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "n" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. (h) if the corporation distributes to all holders of shares of its common stock (i) any shares of any class of capital stock of the corporation other than its common stock, (ii) any evidence of indebtedness or other securities of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation, (iii) any other assets of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation (other than cash), (iv) distributions in cash in excess of three percent (3%) of the net earnings before extraordinary items or (v) any rights, options or warrants to acquire any of the foregoing (other than rights, options or warrants referred to in subparagraph 4(g) above), each of the conversion prices shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 12 c'= c x m - f ----- m where: c' = the adjusted conversion price. c = the then current conversion price. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date mentioned below. f = the fair market value on the record date of the capital stock, securities, indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants applicable to one share of common stock or if the adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph 4(h) is being made in respect of a cash dividend, the total amount of cash to be distributed at such time to holders of common stock. the board of directors shall determine the fair market value. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. (i) if the corporation issues shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price per share on the date the corporation fixes the offering price of such additional shares, each of the conversion prices shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: p - c'= c x o + m ----- a where: c' = the adjusted conversion price. c = the then current conversion price. o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such additional shares. m = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such additional shares. 13 a = the number of shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. this subparagraph 4(i) does not apply to (i) any transaction or issuance described in subparagraph 4(g) or 4(h) above or subparagraph 4(j) below, (ii) the conversion of class aa preferred stock, class ab preferred stock, series a preferred stock, series b preferred stock, series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock issued to the initial holder of the class aa preferred stock on the initial issue date, or the conversion, exchange or exercise of other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock whose issuance was subject to an adjustment pursuant to subparagraph 4(g) or 4(h) above or subparagraph 4(j) below, (iii) common stock issued to the corporation's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors and approved by the holders of common stock when required by law, if such common stock would otherwise by covered by this subparagraph 4(i) (but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby (together with the aggregate number of shares issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of the securities excluded by clause (iii) of subparagraph 4(j) below) and issued after the initial issue date shall not exceed 5% of the common stock outstanding at the time of any such issuance), (iv) common stock issued to acquire, or in the acquisition of, all or any portion of a business, in an arm's-length transaction between the corporation and an unaffiliated third party, whether such acquisition shall be effected by purchase of assets, exchange of securities, merger, consolidation or otherwise, or (v) common stock issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting. (j) if the corporation issues any options, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock (other than class aa preferred stock, class ab preferred stock, series a preferred stock, series b preferred stock, series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or securities issued in transactions described in subparagraph 4(g) or 4(h) above) and for a consideration per share of common stock initially deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities less than the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other securities, each of the conversion prices shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: p - c'= c x o + m ----- o + d 14 where: c' = the adjusted conversion price. c = the then current conversion price. o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such securities. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such securities. m = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such securities. d = the maximum number of shares deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for or upon exercise of such securities at the initial conversion, exchange or exercise rate. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. if all of the common stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities has not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then each of the conversion prices shall promptly be readjusted to the conversion prices which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion, exchange or exercise of such securities. this subparagraph 4(j) does not apply to (i) the issuance of any such securities to acquire, or in the acquisition of, all or any portion of a business, in an arm's-length transaction between the corporation and an unaffiliated third party, whether such acquisition shall be effected by purchase of assets, exchange of securities, merger, consolidation or otherwise, (ii) the issuance of any such securities in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, or (iii) the issuance of any such securities to the corporation's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors and approved by the holders of common stock when required by law, if such securities would otherwise by covered by this subparagraph 4(j) (but only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of the aggregate number of securities excluded hereby (together with the aggregate number of shares excluded by clause (iii) of subparagraph 4(i) above) and issued after the initial issue date shall not exceed 5% of the common stock outstanding at the time of any such issuance). (k) for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to subparagraphs 4(i) and 4(j) above, the following shall apply: (i) in case of the issuance of shares of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the corporation for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; 15 (ii) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the board of directors (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof); and (iii) in the case of the issuance of options, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares, the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the corporation for the issuance of such options, warrants or other securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the conversion or exchange or exercise thereof (the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph 4(k)). (l) no adjustment in the conversion price need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion price. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this paragraph 4 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. (m) no adjustment in the conversion prices need be made under this paragraph 4 for (i) rights to purchase common stock pursuant to a corporation plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest, or (ii) any change in the par value or no par value of the common stock, and in no event shall any adjustment made under this paragraph 4 reduce the conversion prices below the par value of the common stock ($0.01). if an adjustment is made to the conversion price upon the establishment of a record date for a distribution subject to subparagraphs 4(g) or 4(h) above and if such distribution is subsequently canceled, the conversion prices then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board of directors determines to cancel such distribution, to the conversion prices which would have been in effect if such record date had not been fixed. no adjustment in the conversion prices need be made under subparagraphs 4(g) and 4(h) above if the corporation issues or distributes to each holder of class aa preferred stock the shares of common stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants referred to in those subparagraphs which each holder would have been entitled to receive had class aa preferred stock been converted into common stock prior to the happening of such event or the record date with respect thereto. (n) whenever the conversion prices are adjusted, the corporation shall promptly mail to holders of class aa preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment. the corporation shall file with the transfer agent, if any, for class aa preferred stock a certificate from the corporation's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. subject to subparagraph 4(s) below, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. (o) the corporation from time to time may reduce the conversion prices by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may the conversion prices be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the conversion prices are reduced, the corporation shall mail to holders of class aa preferred stock a notice of the reduction. the 16 corporation shall mail, first class, postage prepaid, the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced conversion price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced conversion prices and the period they will be in effect. a reduction of the conversion prices does not change or adjust the conversion prices otherwise in effect for purposes of subparagraphs 4(f), 4(g), 4(h), 4(i) and 4(j) above. (p) if: (i) the corporation takes any action which would require an adjustment in the conversion prices pursuant to subparagraph 4(g) or 4(h) above, or clause (iv) of subparagraph 4(f) above; (ii) the corporation consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity, and stockholders of the corporation must approve the transaction; or (iii) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the corporation; a holder of class aa preferred stock may want to convert such stock into shares of common stock prior to the record date for or the effective date of the transaction so that he may receive the rights, warrants, securities or assets which a holder of shares of common stock on that date may receive. therefore, the corporation shall mail to such holders, first class, postage prepaid, a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. the corporation shall mail the notice at least ten (10) days before such date. failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph 4(p). (q) if the corporation is party to a merger which reclassifies or changes its common stock, upon consummation of such transaction class aa preferred stock shall automatically become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the holder of class aa preferred stock would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if such holder had converted class aa preferred stock immediately before the effective date of the transaction. appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of class aa preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustment of the conversion prices) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of class aa preferred stock. if this subparagraph 4(q) applies, subparagraph 4(f) does not apply. (r) in any case in which this paragraph 4 shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event become effective from and after a record date, the corporation may elect to defer until after the occurrence of such event (i) the issuance to the holder of any shares of class aa preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event of the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable on the basis of the conversion prices in effect immediately prior to adjustment and (ii) a 17 check for any remaining fractional shares of common stock as provided in subparagraph 4(c) above. (s) except as provided in the immediately following sentence, any determination that the corporation or its board of directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be conclusive. whenever the corporation or its board of directors shall be required to make a determination under this paragraph 4, such determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith by a majority of the holders of class aa preferred stock, and any dispute shall be resolved, at the corporation's expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the corporation and acceptable to such holders of class aa preferred stock; provided, however, if the conversion -------- ------- prices or adjustment prices as determined by the board of directors are more than 110% of the price determined by such investment banking firm, then the costs incurred by such investment banking firm shall be borne by the holders of class aa preferred stock who challenged such price. (t) all shares of class aa preferred stock converted pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than class aa preferred stock. 5 voting rights. -------------- (a) the holders of record of shares of class aa preferred stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as hereinafter provided in this paragraph 5 or as otherwise provided by law. (b) so long as any shares of the class aa preferred stock remain outstanding, each share of class aa preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by holders of common stock, voting together with the common stock as a single class (together with all other classes and series of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock) at all meetings of the stockholders of the corporation. in any vote with respect to which the class aa preferred stock shall vote with the holders of common stock as a single class together with all other classes and series of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock, each share of class aa preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of class aa preferred stock is convertible based on the mandatory conversion price of such class aa preferred stock (with such vote to remain constant, even though the conversion rate changes pursuant to the terms hereunder). such voting right of the holders of the class aa preferred stock may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders, any special meeting of stockholders, or by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to take such action pursuant to section 228 of the delaware general corporation law. (c) on any matter on which the holders of class aa preferred stock are entitled by law or under the certificate of incorporation to vote separately as a class, each such holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share held, and such matter shall be determined by a 18 majority of the votes cast unless delaware law or this certificate of designations requires approval by a higher percentage. (d) until a termination event, the number of directors comprising the board of directors shall be equal to fifteen (15) and the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to elect three (3) directors (each such director, a "preferred stock director") at any special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, at each annual meeting of stockholders and in any written consent of stockholders pursuant to section 228 of the delaware general corporation law. any increases in the size of the board of directors will require a proportional increase in the number of preferred stock directors (rounded up to the next whole number) such that the preferred stock directors represent not less than twenty percent (20%) of the votes of the board of directors. a proportionate number (rounded up to the next whole number, but not less than one) of preferred stock directors shall serve on each committee of the board of directors (provided that with respect to the executive committee, the executive committee shall consist of five members of which two members shall be preferred stock directors), and at least one preferred stock director shall serve on the board or other governing body of each of the corporation's subsidiaries and affiliates, other than operational home building companies. in the event (an "adverse event") that on any date following the initial issue date that is 60 days after the end of a fiscal quarter of the corporation (a "test date") both (i) the average trading price of the common stock is below $5 per share (adjusted in the same manner as the mandatory conversion price to take account of any of the occurrences that would require an adjustment pursuant to subparagraphs 4(f) through 4(j) hereof) and (ii) (x) the percentage change in the ebt per share of the corporation (of the common stock issued and outstanding) for the most recent two fiscal quarters as measured against the same two fiscal quarters from the prior fiscal year is less than (y) the percentage change in the ebt per share (of the common stock issued and outstanding) of the comparable group for the same period as compared against the ebt per share (calculated on the same basis) of the comparable group during the same period in the prior fiscal year then the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect preferred stock directors sufficient to cause the preferred stock directors to constitute a majority of the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors, including the executive committee ("additional preferred stock directors"). the size of the board of directors and all committees shall be automatically increased in order to effect any such additional directors. the right of the holders of preferred stock to elect additional preferred stock directors shall continue until such time as neither (i) nor (ii) above is true for two consecutive test dates. the "average trading price" shall mean, on any date of determination, the average of the closing prices of the common stock over the 90 day period prior to such date. (e) the preferred stock directors elected as provided herein shall serve until the next annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and shall qualify. upon the termination of the right of the holders of preferred stock to elect additional preferred stock directors as set forth in subparagraph 5(d) above, any additional preferred stock directors shall resign. any preferred stock director may be removed with or without cause by, and shall not be removed other than by, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent in accordance with section 228 of the delaware general corporate law. if the office of any preferred stock director becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, 19 disqualification or removal from office or otherwise, the remaining preferred stock directors, by majority vote, may elect a successor, or, alternatively, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent in accordance with section 228 of the delaware general corporation law may elect a successor. any such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. upon the occurrence of a termination event, the preferred stock directors then serving on the board of directors may continue to hold their office for the remainder of their term. this subparagraph (e) may not be amended without (x) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and (y) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. (f) at any time when the right to elect preferred stock directors or additional preferred stock directors provided in subparagraph 5(d) shall have vested in the holders of class aa preferred stock and if such right shall not already have been initially exercised, a proper officer of the corporation shall, upon the written request of any holder of record of class aa preferred stock then outstanding, addressed to the secretary of the corporation, call a special meeting of holders of preferred stock. such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders at the place for holding annual meetings of stockholders of the corporation or, if none, at a place designated by the secretary of the corporation. if such meeting shall not be called by the proper officers of the corporation within thirty (30) days after the personal service of such written request upon the secretary of the corporation, or within thirty (30) days after mailing the same within the united states, by registered mail, addressed to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office (such mailing to be evidenced by the registry receipt issued by the postal authorities), then the holders of record of ten percent (10%) of the shares of class aa preferred stock then outstanding may designate in writing a holder of class aa preferred stock to call such meeting at the expense of the corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the place for holding annual meetings of the corporation or, if none, at a place designated by such holder. any holder of class aa preferred stock that would be entitled to vote at such meeting shall have access to the stock books of the corporation for the purpose of causing a meeting of the holders of preferred stock to be called pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph and to contact the holders of preferred stock with respect to matters relating to such meeting. notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, however, no such special meeting shall be called if any such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual or special meeting of stockholders. (g) if at any time when the holders of class aa preferred stock are entitled to elect directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 6, and the holders of class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock are entitled to elect directors by reason of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, as in effect at the time, or the respective certificate of designation for such classes, and if the terms of the class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock so permit, the voting rights of the preferred stock then entitled to vote shall be combined (with each series having a number of votes proportional to the aggregate liquidation preference of its outstanding shares). in such case, the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class, shall elect such directors. 20 (h) in addition to any vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the certificate of incorporation, the consent of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the shares of class aa preferred stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, or of the by-laws of the corporation, which affects adversely the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the holders of shares of class aa preferred stock; provided, however, that the amendment of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of any class of any security convertible into any shares ranking junior to the class aa preferred stock in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the corporation or in the payment of dividends, shall not be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the holders of shares of class aa preferred stock; (ii) any authorization or creation of, or increase in the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or any security convertible into shares of any class ranking senior to or on parity with shares of class aa preferred stock (other than the class ab preferred stock) in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the corporation or in the payment of dividends or otherwise; (iii) any increase or decrease (other than by conversion) in the total number of authorized shares of class aa preferred stock; (iv) any sale, lease, assignment, transfer or other conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or any of its material subsidiaries of which it owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power thereof, or any consolidation or merger involving the corporation or any of such subsidiaries (except mergers between the corporation and any of its subsidiaries or mergers among any of the corporation's subsidiaries), or any reclassification or other change of any stock, or any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the corporation or, unless the obligations of the corporation under an agreement are expressly conditioned upon the requisite approval of the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the class aa preferred stock then outstanding as provided for herein, make any agreement or become obligated to do so; (v) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition for value (or payment into or setting aside as a sinking fund for such purpose) of any shares of common stock or other capital stock of the corporation;

(ii) to convert class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock pursuant to subparagraph 4(a)(ii), notice of any conversion shall be sent by or on behalf of the corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the mandatory conversion date, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock at their respective last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any shares of class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock except as to the holder to whom the corporation has failed to give notice or except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. in addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the mandatory conversion date; (ii) the date on which the conversion price shall be calculated; (iii) the number of shares of class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock to be converted being all the class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock held of record by all holders; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for receipt of such common stock 9 issuable upon such conversion; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on the mandatory conversion date. upon the mailing of any such notices of conversion, the corporation shall become obligated to convert on the mandatory conversion date all of the class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the mandatory conversion date. all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall rank pari passu with the other shares of common ---- ----- stock outstanding from time to time. in the case of class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the holder of such class abi preferred stock and class abii preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of subparagraph 4(a)). holders of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the mandatory conversion date.

(d) if a holder converts shares of class abi preferred stock, the corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of common stock upon the conversion. however, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder's name.

(f) the corporation from time to time may reduce the conversion price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may the conversion price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the conversion price is reduced, the corporation shall mail to holders of class abi preferred stock a notice of the reduction. the corporation shall mail, first class, postage prepaid, the notice at least 15 days before the date the 10 reduced conversion price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced conversion price and the period it will be in effect. (g) if the corporation is party to a merger which reclassifies or changes its common stock, upon consummation of such transaction class abi preferred stock shall automatically become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the holder of class abi preferred stock would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if such holder had converted class abi preferred stock immediately before the effective date of the transaction. appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of class abi preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustment of the conversion price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of class abi preferred stock. (h) in any case in which this paragraph 4 shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event become effective from and after a record date, the corporation may elect to defer until after the occurrence of such event (i) the issuance to the holder of any shares of class abi preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event of the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable on the basis of the conversion price in effect immediately prior to adjustment and (ii) a check for any remaining fractional shares of common stock as provided in subparagraph 4(c) above.

(ii) at any time, on or after [ ], 2002, the corporation, at its option, may convert all, but not less than all of the aggregate shares of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock outstanding at such time into common stock at any time before the close of business on the redemption date; provided that, on the mandatory conversion date, the corporation shall have paid all accrued dividends on all shares of preferred stock then outstanding, up to and including the most recent dividend payment date (unless the corporation shall default in payment of the conversion price) for the purposes of conversion, each share of preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon through the relevant conversion date, which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. immediately following such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted preferred stock shall cease (in respect of such converted stock) and the persons entitled to receive the common stock upon the conversion of preferred stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such common stock. (b) (i) to convert preferred stock pursuant to subparagraph 4(a)(i), a holder must (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed in a form satisfactory to the corporation, at the office of the corporation or transfer agent for the preferred stock, (ii) notify the corporation at such office that he elects to convert preferred stock, and the number of shares he wishes to convert, (iii) state in writing the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued, and (iv) pay any transfer or similar tax if required (provided, however, that no such payment shall be required if the common stock issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the converting holder of preferred stock). in the case of lost or destroyed certificates evidencing ownership of shares of preferred stock to be surrendered for conversion, the holder shall submit proof of loss or destruction, and such indemnity as shall be reasonably required by the corporation. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of preferred stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "optional conversion date." as soon as practical and in any event within five (5) business days of the optional conversation date, the corporation shall deliver through the transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion, a check for any fractional share and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of class abii preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the 8 stockholder of record on and after the optional conversion date. all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the class abi preferred stock and preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall rank pari passu ---- ----- with the other shares of common stock outstanding from time to time. in the case of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the holder of such class abi preferred stock and preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of subparagraph 4(a)). holders of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the optional conversion date. if a holder of preferred stock converts more than one share at a time the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total value of all shares of preferred stock converted. (ii) to convert class abi preferred stock and preferred stock pursuant to subparagraph 4(a)(ii), notice of any conversion shall be sent by or on behalf of the corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the mandatory conversion date, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the class abi preferred stock and preferred stock at their respective last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any shares of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock except as to the holder to whom the corporation has failed to give notice or except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. in addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which class abi preferred stock and preferred stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the mandatory conversion date; (ii) the date on which the conversion price shall be calculated; (iii) the number of shares of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock to be converted being all the class abi preferred stock and preferred stock held of record by all holders; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for receipt of such common stock issuable upon such conversion; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on the mandatory conversion date. upon the mailing of any such notices of conversion, the corporation shall become obligated to convert on the mandatory conversion date all of the class abi preferred stock and preferred stock. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the mandatory conversion date. all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the class abi preferred stock and preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall rank pari passu with the other shares of common stock ---- ----- outstanding from time to time. in case of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock that has been converted after any record date but before the next succeeding dividend payment date, dividends that are payable on such dividend payment date shall be payable on such dividend payment date notwithstanding such conversion, and such dividends shall be paid to the holder of such class abi preferred stock and preferred stock on such record date (and shall not constitute "accrued and unpaid dividends" for purposes of subparagraph 4(a)). holders 9 of common stock issued upon conversion shall not be entitled to receive any dividend payable to holders of common stock as of any record time before the close of business on the mandatory conversion date. (c) the corporation will not issue a fractional share of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock. instead the corporation will deliver its check for the current market value of the fractional share. the current market value of a fraction of a share is determined as follows: multiply the closing market price of a full share by the fraction. round the result to the nearest cent. the closing market price of a share of common stock is the quoted price of the common stock on the last trading day prior to the conversion date. (d) if a holder converts shares of preferred stock, the corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of common stock upon the conversion. however, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder's name. (e) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury enough shares of common stock to permit the conversion of the preferred stock in full. all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation will endeavor to comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock and will endeavor to list such shares on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed. (f) the corporation from time to time may reduce the conversion price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) business days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may the conversion price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the conversion price is reduced, the corporation shall mail to holders of preferred stock a notice of the reduction. the corporation shall mail, first class, postage prepaid, the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced conversion price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced conversion price and the period it will be in effect. (g) if the corporation is party to a merger which reclassifies or changes its common stock, upon consummation of such transaction preferred stock shall automatically become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the holder of preferred stock would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, transfer or lease if such holder had converted preferred stock immediately before the effective date of the transaction. appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustment of the conversion price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of preferred stock. 10 (h) in any case in which this paragraph 4 shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event become effective from and after a record date, the corporation may elect to defer until after the occurrence of such event (i) the issuance to the holder of any shares of preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event of the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable on the basis of the conversion price in effect immediately prior to adjustment and (ii) a check for any remaining fractional shares of common stock as provided in subparagraph 4(c) above. (i) except as provided in the immediately following sentence, any determination that the corporation or its board of directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be conclusive. whenever the corporation or its board of directors shall be required to make a determination under this paragraph 4, such determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith by a majority of the holders of preferred stock, and any dispute shall be resolved, at the corporation's expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the corporation and acceptable to such holders of preferred stock; provided, however, if conversion price as determined -------- ------- by the board of directors is more than 110% of the price determined by the investment banking firm, then the costs incurred by such investment banking firm shall be borne by the holders of preferred stock who challenged such price. (j) all shares of preferred stock converted pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may (subject to any restriction imposed on the company by its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or the stock purchase agreement or any document entered into pursuant thereto) thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than preferred stock. 5 redemption by the corporation. ----------------------------- (a) the class abi preferred stock and the preferred stock, together may be redeemed, in whole, but not in part, at any time on or after ___________, 2002 at the option of the corporation at the redemption price. if the redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the related dividend payment date, the dividend payable shall be paid to the holder in whose name the class abi preferred stock is registered at the close of business on such record date. (b) notice of any redemption shall be sent by or on behalf of the corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the class abi preferred stock and the preferred stock at their respective last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of class abi preferred stock or preferred stock except as to the holder to whom the corporation has failed to give notice or except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. in addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which class abi preferred and preferred stock may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) 11 the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date (vi) the conversion price; (vii) that class abi preferred stock and preferred stock called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the redemption date; and (viii) that holders of class abi preferred stock and preferred stock must satisfy the requirements of subparagraph 4(b) above if such holders desire to convert such shares. upon the mailing of any such notices of redemption, the corporation shall become obligated to redeem at the time of redemption specified thereon all the class abi preferred stock and the preferred stock.

(d) any funds deposited with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming preferred stock shall be irrevocable except that: (i) the corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and (ii) any of monies so deposited by the corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the preferred stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings earned thereon, to the corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the corporation shall look only to the corporation for payment without interest or other earnings. (e) no preferred stock may be redeemed except with funds legally available for the payment of the redemption price. (f) all shares of preferred stock redeemed pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other than shares of preferred stock. 12 6 voting rights. -------------- (a) the holders of record of shares of preferred stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as hereinafter provided in this paragraph 6 or as otherwise provided by law. (b) so long as any shares of the preferred stock remain outstanding, each share of preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by holders of common stock, voting together with the common stock as a single class (together with all other classes and series of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock) at all meetings of the stockholders of the corporation other than in respect of the election of directors (provided that the class abii shall vote in the election of directors if (i) the price of the common stock (as measured by the current market price) is less than $3.00 per share (such amount to be adjusted for stock splits and recombinations as appropriate) and (ii) the holder provides notice to the company that it elects to obtain such voting right). in any vote with respect to which the preferred stock shall vote with the holders of common stock as a single class together with all other classes and series of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote as a single class with the common stock, each share of preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast the number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of preferred stock is convertible based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the immediately preceding initial issue date of such class abii preferred stock (with such vote to remain constant, even through the conversion rate changes pursuant to the terms hereunder). such voting right of the holders of the preferred stock may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders, any special meeting of stockholders, or by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to take such action pursuant to section 228 of the delaware general corporation law. (c) on any matter on which the holders of preferred stock are entitled by law or under the certificate of incorporation to vote separately as a class, each such holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share held, and such matter shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast unless delaware law or this certificate of designations requires approval by a higher percentage. (d) until a termination event, the number of directors comprising the board of directors shall be equal to fifteen (15) and the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, shall have the exclusive right to elect three (3) directors (each such director, a "preferred stock director") at any special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, at each annual meeting of stockholders and in any written consent of stockholders pursuant to section 228 of the delaware general corporation law. any increases in the size of the board of directors will require a proportional increase in the number of preferred stock directors (rounded up to the next whole number such that the preferred stock directors represent not less than twenty percent (20%) of the votes of the board of directors). a proportionate number (rounded up to the next whole number, but not less than one) of preferred stock directors shall serve on each committee of the board of directors (provided that with respect to the executive committee, the executive committee shall consist of five members of which two members shall 13 be preferred stock directors), and at least one preferred stock director shall serve on the board or other governing body of each of the corporation's subsidiaries and affiliates, other than operational home building companies. in the event (an "adverse event") that on any date following the initial issue date that is 60 days after the end of a fiscal quarter of the corporation (a "test date") both (i) the average trading price of the common stock is below $5 per share (provided that such amount shall be adjusted for reverse stock splits, recapitalizations and other similar events) and (ii) (x) the percentage change in the ebt per share of the corporation (of the common stock issued and outstanding) for the most recent two fiscal quarters as measured against the same two fiscal quarters from the prior fiscal year is less than (y) the percentage change in the ebt per share (of the common stock issued and outstanding) of the comparable group for the same period as compared against the ebt per share (calculated on the same basis) of the comparable group during the same period in the prior fiscal year then the holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect preferred stock directors sufficient to cause the preferred stock directors to constitute a majority of the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors, including the executive committee ("additional preferred stock directors"). the size of the board of directors and all committees shall be automatically increased in order to effect any such additional directors. the right of the holders of preferred stock to elect additional preferred stock directors shall continue until such time as neither (i) nor (ii) above is true for two consecutive test dates. the "average trading price" shall mean, on any date of determination, the average of the closing prices of the common stock over the 90 day period prior to such date. (e) the preferred stock directors elected as provided herein shall serve until the next annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and shall qualify. upon the termination of the right of the holders of preferred stock to elect additional preferred stock directors as set forth in subparagraph 6(d) above, any additional preferred stock directors shall resign. any preferred stock director may be removed with or without cause by, and shall not be removed other than by, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent in accordance with section 228 of the delaware general corporate law. if the office of any preferred stock director becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office or otherwise, the remaining preferred stock directors, by majority vote, may elect a successor, or, alternatively, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent in accordance with section 228 of the delaware general corporation law may elect a successor. any such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. upon the occurrence of a termination event, the preferred stock directors then serving on the board of directors may continue to hold their office for the remainder of their term. this subparagraph (e) may not be amended without (x) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and (y) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock.
