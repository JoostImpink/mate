plan of reorganization under title 11 of united states code dated december 12, 1996 (the "prepackaged plan"). the common units and other consideration received by the reporting person described below were received in exchange for (i) loans and other extensions of credit previously made by the reporting person to the issuer and (ii) a warrant (the "bt warrant") to purchase 1,975,552 common units for $.875 per common unit, expiring on december 31, 2008, previously issued by the issuer to the reporting person. such loans and other extensions of credit were made by the reporting person in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial bank. the bt warrant was received by the reporting person in connection with a general restructuring of the indebtedness of the issuer on june 23, 1993. item 4. purpose of the transaction the exchange by the reporting person of loans, other extensions of credit and the bt warrant for new common units and other consideration was done pursuant to the prepackaged plan of the issuer. the issuer commenced its prepackaged plan of reorganization in order to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt and thereby improve its viability and its ability to service its debt obligations. the prepackaged plan was declared effective on december 30, 1996. pursuant to the prepackaged plan, the issuer issued common units, promissory notes, and other consideration to the reporting person as follows: a. promissory notes previously issued to the reporting person by the issuer aggregating $40,867,844 in principal amount plus accrued interest thereon were exchanged for new promissory notes of the issuer ("collateralized notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $11,944,345, accruing interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and 3,220,228 common units representing approximately 12.7% of the common units outstanding on the plan effective date. b. the bt warrant was exchanged for 3,708,189 common units. c. the reimbursement obligations for letters of credit issued by the reporting person for the account of the issuer and sunbelt refining company, lp, a subsidiary of the issuer, aggregating approximately $17,500,000 were continued under a new letter of credit facility provided by the reporting person. such facility permits up to $17,500,000 (subject to certain limitations set forth in said facility) aggregate stated amount of letters of credit to be issued. d. as further consideration for the exchange by the reporting person of promissory notes and the bt warrant, the issuer entered into the unitholders agreement with the reporting person, massachusetts mutual life insurance company ("mass mutual"), mellon bank, n.a., as trustee for first plaza group trust ("mellon bank"), oppenheimer & co., inc., for itself and as agent for certain affiliates ("oppenheimer"), lindner growth fund ("lindner"), madison dearborn partners iii ("mdp") and first chicago equity corporation ("fcec"). the unitholders agreement provides, among other things, for the issuance from time to time of additional common units to the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders. the amount of additional common units to be issued under the unitholders agreement will be sufficient to prevent dilution of the common units issued to the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of common units to certain other parties after the plan effective date. the reporting person expects to receive additional common units pursuant to this agreement in january 1996. because the exact number of common units to be issued to such other parties cannot be determined at this time, the number of common units to be issued to the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders under the unitholders agreement cannot be determined at this time. the reporting person, mass mutual, mellon bank, oppenheimer, and lindner are collectively referred to as the "senior lenders." mdp and fcec are collectively referred to herein as the "junior lenders". the prepackaged plan also provided for the exchange by the other senior lenders of promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $39,537,606 plus accrued interest and warrants to acquire 1,365,205 common units for $.875 per common unit expiring december 31, 2008, for (i) promissory notes of the issuer identical to those received by the reporting person (other than a note received by the reporting person representing the reimbursement obligation for the letter of credit issued for the account of sunbelt) in the aggregate principal amount of $11,555,656, accruing interest at 12% per annum, and (ii) 5,807,845 common units identical to those received by the reporting person, representing approximately 22.92% of the common units outstanding on the plan effective date. the senior lenders are also parties to the unitholders agreement. the prepackaged plan further provided for the exchange by the junior lenders of junior subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $7,000,000 plus accrued interest for (i) junior subordinated notes of the issuer in the aggregate principal amount of $2,070,000 that differ from those received by the reporting person and (ii) 1,050,142 common units identical to those received by the reporting person, representing 4.14% of the common units outstanding. the junior lenders may be affiliates of the general partners of the issuer. the junior lenders are also parties to the unitholders agreement. the notes received by the junior lenders are subordinated in right of payment to the notes received by the senior lenders. the common units acquired by the reporting person have the voting rights provided to common units in the issuer's amended and restated agreement of limited partnership, dated november 9, 1988, as amended. new common units that may be issued from time to time under the unitholders agreement will have the voting rights described above for common units issued on the effective date of the prepackaged plan. the reporting person has no intention of acquiring any additional equity securities of the issuer, other than the common units to be received from time to time pursuant to the unitholders agreement. the reporting person may request the issuer to convert from a master limited partnership to corporate form. except for such request, the reporting person has no plans or proposals relating to extraordinary transactions involving the issuer, the sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or of any of its subsidiaries, any changes in the general partner of the issuer (or the present operating committee thereof) or management of the issuer, any material change in the present capitalization or distribution policy of the issuer, any other material change in the issuer's business or partnership structure or any changes in the issuer's agreement of limited partnership. the reporting person has no plans or proposals to cause any class of securities of the issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, to cause a class of equity securities of the issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or any action similar to any of the above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) the reporting person beneficially owns 6,928,417 common units as of december 30, 1996. based upon information provided by the issuer, there were outstanding on december 30, 1996, 25,342,654 common units of the issuer, after the effectiveness of the plan. accordingly, the reporting person beneficially owns approximately 27.33% of the outstanding common units. the reporting person believes that additional common units will be issued to it, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders on or shortly after december 31, 1996 pursuant to the unitholders agreement. however, the exact number of common units to be issued has not been determined. by virtue of their receipt of notes and common units in the prepackaged plan and the unitholders agreement and the support agreement, the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders may comprise a "group" for purposes of the acquisition of the common units issued to the reporting person, the other senior lender and the junior lenders pursuant to the prepackaged plan. based upon information set forth in the disclosure statement relating to the prepackaged plan, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders beneficially own the following respective number of common units: senior lenders and number of common junior lenders units beneficially owned % of total massachusetts mutual life 3,830,279 15.11% insurance company first plaza group

upon such information, the aggregate common units delivered to the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders represent beneficial ownership of approximately 66.2% of all common units outstanding on the plan effective date. the reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of any common units which may have been acquired by the other senior lenders or the junior lenders pursuant to the prepackaged plan, or may be acquired by the other senior lenders or the junior lenders pursuant to the unitholders agreement. includes 945,127 common units to be received pursuant to the prepackaged plan plus 2,986,835 common units previously acquired, according to the disclosure statement. (b) except for certain restrictions in the unitholders agreement, the support agreement, and the registration rights agreement, the reporting person has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the common units beneficially owned by it and any common units issuable to it pursuant to the unitholders agreement. the reporting person, the issuer, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders have entered into a support agreement dated as of july 22, 1996. pursuant to this agreement, the reporting person has agreed, in certain circumstances set forth therein, to vote its common units in favor of a proposal that may be made by the issuer or the other parties to the support agreement to convert the issuer to corporate form. pursuant to the unitholders agreement, the reporting person and the other parties thereto have agreed not to dispose of the common units for a period of 180 days following the effective date of the prepackaged plan. the reporting person, the issuer, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders have entered into a registration rights agreement dated as of december 12, 1996, more fully described in section 6. pursuant to this agreement, the reporting person and the other parties thereto have agreed on certain terms and conditions not to dispose of the common units for a period of 180 days following an underwritten public offering of equity securities by the issuer. (c) except for the acquisition of common units and entering into the unitholders agreement and the registration rights agreement described in section 6, neither the reporting person nor parent has engaged in any transactions relating to common units for the sixty day period preceding the date of the filing of this statement. the reporting person has no knowledge of any such transaction involving any other senior lender or junior lender during such period other than the receipt of the common units and entering into the unitholders agreement and the registration rights agreement pursuant to the prepackaged plan. (d) no person other than the reporting person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of distributions from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the common units issued to the reporting person or the common units issuable to the reporting person pursuant to the unitholders agreement. item 6. contracts, agreements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders are party to the unitholders agreement, dated as of december 12, 1996. pursuant to the unitholders agreement, the issuer agrees to issue to the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders such amount of common units as is necessary to prevent dilution to the common units issued to such parties on the plan effective date that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of common units to the junior lenders pursuant to a junior subordinated indenture dated as of december 12, 1996, and to the issuer's management. the unitholders agreement also provides that the reporting person, the other senior lenders and the junior lenders will not sell, transfer, assign or convey any common unit

units, representing 4.4% of reorganized huntway's common units issued and outstanding on the effective date. the holders of class 5 claims will also receive such number of additional common units from time to time as are sufficient to prevent dilution caused by the issuance from time to time to holders of (a) class 5 claims of common units as payment of accrued interest on the new junior notes and (b) class 8 equity interests of additional unit options (or equivalent rights to receive common units) and class 2 and class 6 equity interests of additional common units, in each case issued to

claims are entitled to vote on the prepackaged plan. approval of the prepackaged plan by holders of at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of allowed class 5 claims with respect to which votes are received is required to confirm the prepackaged plan. 3. allowed claims: the claims of the junior lenders under the old junior subordinated debenture indenture constitute allowed claims. confirmation of the prepackaged plan shall constitute a finding that the allowed class 5 claims are fully valid. class 6: warrants 1. classification: class 6 consists of all warrants. 2. treatment: on the effective date, a holder of an allowed class 6 equity interest shall receive such holder's pro rata share of 6,335,663 of reorganized huntway's common units, representing approximately 25% of reorganized huntway's common units issued and outstanding on the effective date. the holders of class 6 equity interests will also receive such number of additional common units from time to time as are sufficient to prevent dilution caused by the issuance from time to time to holders of (a) class 5 claims of common units as payment of accrued interest on the new junior notes

the prepackaged plan by holders of at least two-thirds in amount of allowed class 6 equity interests with respect to which votes are received is required to confirm the prepackaged plan. class 7: common units 1. classification: class 7 consists of the common units. 2. treatment: on the effective date, a holder of an allowed equity interest in class 7 shall retain its common units. class 7 is impaired. approval of the prepackaged plan by holders of at least two-thirds in amount of allowed class 7 equity interests with respect to which votes are received is required to confirm the

the effective date, a holder of an allowed equity interest in class 8 shall be issued such holder's pro rata share of 1,022,000 unit options under the new unit option plan, which unit options will have terms and conditions in all natural respects the same as the existing unit options, except that they shall have an exercise price of $.50 per common unit. holders of class 8 equity interests will

common units as payment of accrued interest on the new junior notes and (b) class 2 claims, class 5 claims and class 6 equity interests of common units issued to prevent dilution to such holders. on the effective date, the existing option plan shall be terminated and of no further force and effect. to the extent that any anti-dilution provisions in the existing option plan may be interpreted to be triggered by consummation, confirmation of the prepackaged plan eliminates: (i) the rights of holders of allowed equity interests evidenced by existing unit options issued under the existing option plan to receive any additional common units or to receive any other type of security pursuant to such anti-dilution provisions; and (ii) the authority (whether mandatory or discretionary) of any committee under the existing option plan or the board to make adjustments under the existing option plan on account of the transaction implemented by the prepackaged plan. class 8 is impaired.

the holder of all danesh options has agreed to the treatment of such options under the prepackaged plan. therefore, class 9 is unimpaired and the holders of equity interests in class 9 are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the prepackaged plan. the legal, equitable and contractual rights of the holder of class 9 equity interests, as agreed to by the holder thereof, are unaltered by the prepackaged plan. class 10: general partner interests 1. classification: class 10 consists of the general partner interests. 2. treatment: on the effective date, the general partner and the

5 and each holder of an equity interest in class 6, class 7, class 8 or class 10, in each case as of the record date, is entitled to vote either to accept or to reject the prepackaged plan. only those votes cast by holders of allowed claims and/or allowed equity interests shall be counted in determining whether acceptances have been received sufficient in number and amount to confirm the prepackaged plan. each claim or equity interest, as applicable, in each of class 2, class 5, class 6, class 7, class 8, class 9 or class 10 shall be deemed to be "allowed" for purposes of voting on the prepackaged plan unless, prior to the confirmation hearing, the debtor has filed an objection to any such claim or equity interest with the bankruptcy court. unless the bankruptcy court subsequently determines that ballots and master ballots may be revoked, such ballots and master ballots will remain in full force and effect until the bankruptcy court determines whether such ballots and master ballots are deemed to constitute acceptances or rejections of the prepackaged plan. for each holder of a class 2 claim who consents to the prepackaged plan and does not withhold releases in accordance with section v.i(ii), the prepackaged plan (i) shall release and discharge such holder and such holder's parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, directors, officers, attorneys, financial advisors, agents and employees past and present from claims of the huntway releasors (as defined in section v.i(i)) to the extent set forth in subsection v.i(i) below, and (ii) shall release

forth in subsection v.i(ii). b. acceptance by impaired classes. class 2a, class 2b, class 2c and class 5 shall have accepted the prepackaged plan if (i) the holders (other than any holder designated under subsection 1126(e) of the bankruptcy code) of at least two-thirds in dollar amount of the allowed claims actually voting in each such class have voted to accept the prepackaged plan and (ii) the holders (other than any holder designated under subsection 1126(e) of the bankruptcy code) of more than one-half in number of the allowed claims actually voting in each such class have voted to accept the prepackaged plan. an impaired class of equity interests shall have accepted the prepackaged plan if the holders (other than any holder designated under subsection 1126(e) of the bankruptcy code) of at least two-thirds in amount of allowed equity interests actually voting in such class have voted to accept the prepackaged plan. c. presumed acceptance of prepackaged plan. class 1, class 3, class 4 and class 9 are unimpaired under the prepackaged plan, and, therefore, are conclusively presumed to have accepted the prepackaged plan. iv. provisions for treatment of professional fees and disputed, contingent and unliquidated claims a. resolution of disputed claims. unless otherwise ordered by the bankruptcy court after notice and a hearing, huntway shall have the exclusive right to make and file objections to claims (other than class 2 claims and class 5 claims), and shall serve a copy of each objection upon the holder of the disputed claim to which the objection is made, as well as counsel for any committee. notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise ordered by the court, except for claimants under rejected executory contracts and unexpired leases, who must file proofs of claim and who will be subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code, holders of class 3 claims and class 4 claims need not and should not file proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court. nothing in the prepackaged plan, the confirmation order or any order in aid of confirmation of the prepackaged plan, shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a waiver or release of any claim, cause of action, right of setoff, or other legal or equitable defense which huntway had immediately prior to the commencement of the prepackaged chapter 11 case, against or with respect to any claim in class 3 or class 4. during the pendency of the prepackaged chapter 11 case and upon confirmation thereof, the debtor shall have, retain, reserve and be entitled to assert all such claims, causes of action, rights of setoff and other legal or equitable defenses which it had immediately prior to the commencement of the prepackaged chapter 11 case fully as if the prepackaged chapter 11 case had not been commenced; and all of huntway's legal and equitable rights respecting any claim in class 3 and class 4 may be asserted after the confirmation date to the same extent as if the prepackaged chapter 11 case had not been commenced. v. implementation of the prepackaged plan a. issuance of new senior notes, new junior notes, common units and unit options. the issuance of the new senior notes, new

trustee thereunder any and all amounts due to the trustee. c. waiver of subordination. the distributions under the prepackaged plan take into account the relative priority of the claims in each class in connection with any contractual subordination provisions or other intercreditor agreements relating thereto. accordingly, all distributions under the prepackaged plan (including, without limitation, the distributions to the holders of class 5 claims) shall not be subject to levy, garnishment, attachment or other legal process by reason of claimed contractual subordination rights (including, without limitation, rights arising under the old subordinated note indenture, the old junior subordinated debenture indenture and the existing intercreditor agreement). on the effective date, all creditors shall be deemed to have waived any and all contractual subordination rights which they may have had under the terms of the old subordinated note indenture and the old junior subordinated debenture indenture with respect to such distribution, and the confirmation order shall permanently enjoin, effective as of the effective date, all holders of senior indebtedness (as defined in each of the old collateralized note indenture and the old subordinated note indenture) from enforcing or attempting to enforce any such rights which existed prior to the entry of the confirmation order under the terms of the old subordinated note indenture, the old junior subordinated debenture indenture and the existing intercreditor agreement against any party with respect to

to execute the documents required to be executed by such holder under this section v. within 30 days after the effective date shall be deemed to have forfeited all rights, claims, equity interests and other interests in huntway and reorganized huntway and shall not participate in any distributions hereunder and all property in respect of such forfeited distribution, including interest accrued thereon, shall revert to reorganized huntway. f. surrender of old notes and warrants. holders of allowed senior lender claims shall surrender their old collateralized notes and old subordinated notes

satisfactory to huntway and, in the event that huntway requests, fails to furnish a bond in form and substance (including, without limitation, with respect to amount) reasonably satisfactory to huntway within five (5) years after the effective date, shall be deemed to have forfeited all rights, claims, equity interests and any other interests and shall not participate in any distributions hereunder and all property in respect of such forfeited distribution, including interest accrued thereon, shall revert to reorganized huntway. g. agreement of limited partnership. the agreement of limited partnership of reorganized huntway shall be amended by the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership as of the effective date. the amendment to the amended and restated

consummation of the prepackaged plan before january 1, 1997 and (iv) no other event occurs that reasonably gives such senior lender or junior lender grounds to believe that failure to issue a report

and all prior contemporaneous agreements, understandings and arrangements relating to the subject matter hereof. the agreements of the parties contained herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this agreement, the confirmation of the prepackaged plan, the approval of any disclosure and/or solicitation materials related thereto and the consummation of all of the transactions contemplated by the prepackaged plan. 8. this letter agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same

parties hereto. this letter agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successor, assigns, and permitted transferees. 10. except with respect

(c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party or parties from which such indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying parties") of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) (collectively, "proceedings" and individually, a "proceeding") with respect to which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying parties shall not relieve the indemnifying parties from any obligation or liability except to the extent that an indemnifying party was not otherwise aware of such proceeding and the indemnifying parties have been materially prejudiced by such failure. the indemnifying parties shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such proceeding, to assume, at the indemnifying parties' expense, the defense of any such proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding; provided further, that an indemnified party or parties (if more than one such indemnified party is named in any proceeding) shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless: (i) the indemnifying party or parties agree to pay such fees and expenses; or (ii) the indemnifying parties fail promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding or fail to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or parties; or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party or parties, a conflict of interest may exist between the positions of the indemnifying party or an affiliate of the indemnifying party and such indemnified party or parties in conducting the defense of such action or proceeding or that there may be legal defenses available to such indemnified party or parties different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate, in which case, if such indemnified party or parties notifies the indemnifying parties in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying parties, the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying parties, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying parties shall not, in connection with any one such proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such indemnified party or parties. whether or not such defense is assumed by the indemnifying parties, such indemnifying parties or indemnified party or parties will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its or their consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent each indemnifying party jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exception and limitations set forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless for any losses in respect to which this section 9 would otherwise apply by its terms, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have an obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. where the indemnified party is an underwriter participating in the distribution of registrable securities, however, each indemnifying party, and, in addition, if the indemnifying party is a holder, the company, shall have an obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as the result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only (i) the relative fault of the company, the holders and the underwriters in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, but also (ii) the relative benefits received by the holders on the one hand and the underwriters on the other hand from the distribution of the registrable securities. the relative benefits received by the holders, on the one hand, and the underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from any such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the holders bear to the total underwriting discounts or commissions received by the underwriters. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses if the indemnification provided for in sections 9(a) or 9(b) were available to such party. (e) limit on contribution. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of section 9(d), an indemnifying party that is a selling holder of registrable securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities sold by such indemnifying party and distributed to the public were offered to the public (net of any underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses) exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay or has paid by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) remedies cumulative. the indemnity, contribution and expense reimbursement obligations under this section 9 shall be in addition to any liability each indemnifying person may otherwise have and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (g) underwriting agreement controls. in the event of any conflict between the indemnification and contribution terms as herein set forth and as set forth in any underwriting agreement entered pursuant hereto, the underwriting agreement shall control. 10. selection of underwriters. (a) selection by majority holders. if any of the registrable securities covered by any registration statement (other than a piggyback registration statement) are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the majority holders. (b) selection by the company. if any of the registrable securities covered by a piggyback registration statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the company. (c) agreement to comply. no holder of registrable securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the majority holders, and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, custodial or escrow agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 11. incorporation, merger, etc. in the event that the company (a) incorporates, becomes a limited liability company or otherwise changes its form of business entity, (b) consolidates with or merges with any other person, (c) sells, conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) in a single transaction or series of transactions to any person, the company shall cause any such person or other successor to the company to agree in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this agreement. 12. other registration rights. the company represents that it has not granted registration rights other than as set forth in this agreement and covenants that it will not grant any other registration rights for so long as any registrable securities are outstanding, except that the company may grant (a) "piggyback" registration rights that entitle the holder to include common units in an offering only after all the holders have included in such offering all registrable securities they elect to include under sections 3 and 4 hereof and (b) "demand" registration rights to persons who hereinafter purchase equivalent units provided such rights may not be exercised if any holder elects to exercise its rights under section 3 hereof (provided such election is made within 15 days after notice is given to all the holders that another holder of "demand" registration rights desires to exercise them). 13. miscellaneous. (a) damages. without limiting in any way any of the rights the holders of the restricted securities may otherwise have at law or in equity, for damages or otherwise, the company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each holder of restricted securities from and against any loss or expense that may be incurred or suffered by such holder which arises from any of the following: (i) any demand registration statement that is not filed with the commission on or before the time required in section 3, or (ii) the company is not able for any reason within its control to cause the demand registration statement to be declared effective by the sec at the time reasonably requested by the underwriters in the offering and to remain effective until completion of the offering, or to cause the registrable securities to be qualified or registered for sale in all appropriate jurisdictions as provided in section 7(h) and to remain so qualified or registered thereafter during the applicable period under applicable law. (b) specific performance. in the event of a breach by the company of any of its obligations under this agreement, each holder of registrable securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the company and each holder agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by the company or such holder, as the case may be, of any of the provisions of this agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, the company or such holder, as the case may be, shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. no failure or delay on the part of the company or any holder of registrable securities in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. (c) no inconsistent agreements. the company has not previously entered into, and will not on or after the date of this agreement enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the terms of this agreement, including any agreement which impairs or limits the registration rights granted to the holders or which otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof or would preclude the company from discharging its obligations hereunder. (d) amendments and waivers. the provisions of section 6, section 8, section 9 hereof and this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the express written consent of each party hereto. the other provisions of this agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the company has obtained the written consent of the majority holders of the then outstanding registrable securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of holders of registrable securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a registration statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other holders of registrable securities may be given by holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities being sold by holders pursuant to such registration statement; provided, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. (e) notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (which is confirmed) or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) to the parties at the addresses set forth below the name of each party hereto on the signature pages hereof (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice) (f) interpretation. when a reference is made in this agreement to a section, such reference shall be to a section of this agreement unless otherwise indicated. the headings contained in this agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this agreement. whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." for purposes of this agreement, "best efforts" shall mean the lawful efforts that a prudent business person desirous of achieving a result would use under similar circumstances to attempt to achieve such result as expeditiously as is reasonably practicable. (g) counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. (h) entire agreement; no third party beneficiaries. this agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (ii) except as contemplated by section 9 hereof, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. (i) governing law. this agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of california, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. (j) severability. wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remainder of this agreement, unless such a construction would be unreasonable or materially impair the rights of any party hereto. (k) assignment. neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by the company (whether by operation of law or otherwise) except in accordance with section 11 hereof or with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. subject to the preceding sentence, this agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. (l) attorneys' fees. as between the parties to this agreement, in any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this agreement, or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to its costs and expenses and any other available remedy. (m) securities held by the company or its affiliates. whenever the percentage of registrable securities held by holders is required to be determined hereunder for purposes of determining the authority of such holders to take actions hereunder, registrable securities held by the company or its affiliates (as such term is defined in rule 405 under the regulations) (other than the holders of registrable securities if such holders are deemed to be such affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such registrable securities) shall not be counted in determining the percentage of registrable securities held by such holders. (n) use of terms. this agreement contemplates the filing of registration statements under the securities act on numerous occasions involving various offers of securities. in connection with such registration statements, there may be identified therein one or more underwriters through which securities are to be offered on behalf of the company or one or more of the holders, or both, pursuant to either a "firm-commitment" or "best-efforts" arrangement, and, in the case where there is more than one underwriter, one or more of the underwriters may be designated as the "manager" or "representative" or the "co-managers" or "representatives" of the several underwriters. accordingly, all references herein to an "underwriter" or the "underwriters" are intended to refer to a "principal underwriter" (as defined in rule 405 of the regulations) and to provide for those transactions in which securities may be offered by or through one or more underwriters, and not to imply that any of the transactions contemplated hereby is conditioned in any manner whatsoever on the participation therein by one or more underwriters on behalf of any party. nothing contained herein relating to the company's obligation to enter into an underwriting agreement at any time or from time to time in the future shall impair, alter, restrict or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever the duties of the board of directors of the managing general partner company under applicable law in approving the form, terms and provisions thereof. in witness whereof, the parties have executed this agreement as of the date first written above. huntway partners, l.p. by: /s/ warren j. nelson name: warren j. nelson title: executive vice president and chief financial officer notice address: warren nelson huntway partners, l.p. 25129 the old road, suite 322 newhall, ca 91381 bankers trust company by: /s/ carl o. roark name: carl o. roark title: managing director notice address: carl roark bankers trust company one bankers trust plaza mail stop 2283 130 liberty street, 28th floor new york, new york 10066 massachusetts mutual life insurance company by: /s/ michael l. klofas name: michael l. klofas title: managing director notice address: mike klofas mass mutual life insurance company 1295 state street springfield, ma 01111 mellon bank, n.a., as trustee for first plaza group trust by: /s/ laura a. adams name: laura a. adams title: trust officer notice address: c/o john r. bauer managing partner contrarian capital management, l.l.c. 411 west putnam, suite 225 greenwich, connecticut 06830 oppenheimer & company, inc., for itself and as agent for certain affiliates by: /s/ john bauer name: john bauer title: managing partner notice address: c/o john r. bauer managing partner contrarian capital management, l.l.c. 411 west putnam, suite 225 greenwich, connecticut 06830 lindner growth fund by: ryback management corporation by: /s/ larry callahan name: larry callahan title: vice president notice address: c/o larry callahan ryback management corporation 7711 carondelet avenue, suite 700 st. louis, misouri 63105 first chicago equity corporation by: /s/ william j. roberts name: william j. roberts title: vice president and director notice address: sam mencoff first chicago equity corporation three first national plaza, suite 1300 chicago, illinois, 606021 madison dearborn partners iii by: /s/ justin s. huscher name: justin s. huscher title: general partner notice address: sam mencoff madison dearborn partners iii three first national plaza, suite 1300 chicago, illinois, 606021 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
