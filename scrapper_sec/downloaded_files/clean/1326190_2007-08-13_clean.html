descriptions are qualified in their entirety by the instruments included as exhibits to this statement. merger agreement upon the consummation of the merger, pai acquisition corp., a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of haq, was merged into former pharmathene. former pharmathene survived the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of haq, and stockholders of former pharmathene exchanged their former pharmathene equity interests for 12,500,000 shares of haq common stock thereby becoming equityholders of issuer. stockholders of former pharmathene also may potentially be entitled to milestone payments not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate. noteholders of former pharmathene exchanged their outstanding 8% convertible notes of former pharmathene for new 8% convertible notes of issuer in the principal amount of $12,500,000 with a maturity date two years from the date of issuance. the total merger consideration had a potential aggregate value of $112,500,000 (based upon issuer&#146;s common stock price of $7.20 per share on july 10, 2007 and assuming all of the milestone payments are made). the number of shares of haq common stock issuable as part of the total merger consideration was also subject to adjustment under the merger agreement to the extent that more than 5% of the holders of haq common stock issued in its initial public offering elected to convert their shares into cash at the closing. prior to the effective time of the merger, the bshi funds assigned their right to (i) all shares of haq common stock that they would otherwise be entitled to receive under the merger agreement as a result of any adjustments arising out of the number of shares converted to cash by existing haq stockholders at the closing, plus (ii) an aggregate of 46,293 additional shares, to certain third party purchasers, including some affiliated with millennium management, l.l.c. these assignments were made as a condition to such new stockholders&#146; purchasing additional shares from existing holders of haq common stock who had indicated their intent to convert those shares to cash. as a result, the bshi funds did not receive additional shares in the merger as a result of the adjustment of the merger consideration payable to former pharmathene stockholders generally. stock escrow agreement under the terms of the merger agreement, the stockholders, optionholders and warrantholders of former pharmathene agreed to indemnify issuer for the breach of any representations or warranties or covenants by former pharmathene and agreed that 1,375,000 shares of common stock from the merger consideration will be placed into escrow to be used to satisfy any claims (the &#147;escrow shares&#148;). the indemnification is subject to a limitation that issuer incur damages of at least $500,000 prior to making any claim. further, the indemnification obligation is limited solely and exclusively to the escrow shares. table of contents cusip no. 42224h104 13d page 16 of 22 pages in accordance with the stock escrow agreement entered into in connection with these escrow arrangements, the bshi funds have placed shares of common stock received as merger consideration into escrow in the following amounts: bshi (21,614 shares); offshore (17,781 shares); bx (85,889 shares); employee fund (14,021 shares); and members (10,045 shares). the escrow shares will be held in escrow until satisfaction of any claims. any claims by issuer against the shares must be made within 12 months of closing of the merger. for purposes of determining the number of shares required to settle any claim for which issuer is entitled to indemnification, the parties have agreed to assign a value equal to the average reported last sales price for the ten trading days ending on the last day prior to the date that the claim for indemnification is publicly disclosed (or if there is no public disclosure, the date on which the indemnification notice is received) and the ten trading days after such date. issuer and the former pharmathene stockholders, optionholders and warrantholders, in each case, have appointed a representative who will have the power and authority to negotiate and settle claims. additionally, the representatives of the two parties can mutually agree to a different value of the escrowed shares in order to settle third parties claims, or use the shares to actually settle any claim. mr. john pappajohn has been appointed to serve as issuer&#146;s representative and mpm bioventures iii-qp, l.p. has been appointed to serve as the representative of the former pharmathene stockholders, optionholders and warrantholders. lockup agreement as a condition to the closing of the merger, substantially all of the holders of capital stock and all of the noteholders of former pharmathene, including each of the bshi funds, entered into lock-up agreements with issuer covering the shares of issuer common stock that they received in the merger or that they may acquire in the future, subject to certain limitations. these agreements provide that, subject to certain exceptions, the parties thereto may not offer, pledge, sell, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of common stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of common stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, following the closing of the merger. in addition, the parties may not enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers the economic consequence of ownership of such common stock during such period. fifty percent of the shares of common stock subject to the lock-up agreements shall be released from the lock-up six months following the merger, and all shares of common stock subject to the lock-up shall be released from the lock-up agreement twelve months following the closing. description of 8% convertible notes pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective date, issuer issued a new series of 8% senior unsecured convertible notes (the &#147;8% convertible notes&#148;) to the holders of former pharmathene&#146;s previously outstanding 8% convertible notes (the &#147;old notes&#148;). the 8% convertible notes were issued in the aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000 and replaced the old notes in the principal amount of $11,800,000. the 8% convertible notes are obligations of issuer, not former pharmathene, and have a maturity date two years from the date of issuance. the 8% convertible notes were issued pursuant to the terms of a note exchange agreement, executed at the closing of the merger, between and among issuer and the holders of the old notes (the &#147;note exchange agreement&#148;). the 8% convertible notes accrue simple interest at 8% per annum (based upon a 360 day year), except, after an event of default, the interest rate will increase to 12% per annum. such interest shall only be payable upon repayment of the notes. prior to the payment of interest upon repayment, interest shall accrue at the applicable interest rate and be payable by way of inclusion of the interest in the &#147;conversion amount&#148; as defined in the notes. the maturity date for payment of all principal and interest on the new notes is two years from the effective date. the principal amount of the 8% convertible notes and any accrued interest are convertible into shares of issuer&#146;s common stock at the option of the holders at any time based upon an initial conversion rate of $10.00 per share. the noteholder is required to provide issuer with a written notice of the amount of the holder&#146;s note to be converted. if issuer fails to deliver a share certificate to the holder requesting conversion within seven business days of the request to convert, issuer may incur a penalty equal to 1.5% per day of the product of the number of shares to which the holder is entitled and the closing sale price of issuer&#146;s common stock on the day of the request for conversion. table of contents cusip no. 42224h104 13d page 17 of 22 pages the conversion rate is not subject to adjustment except for certain corporate events such as stock splits, subdivisions, combinations, dividends and similar transactions. there are no &#147;price protection&#148; adjustments which otherwise would require an adjustment in the conversion ratio as a result of the sale or issuance by issuer of shares of its common stock. upon a &#147;change of control&#148; as defined in the 8% convertible notes, any holder of a note may require issuer to redeem all (but not less than all) of such note for a price equal to the principal amount then outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any accrued and unpaid late charges with respect to such principal and interest, provided, however, that issuer will not be required to redeem any of the 8% convertible notes upon a change of control unless at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% convertible notes then outstanding submit optional change of control redemption notices. a &#147;change of control&#148; generally means (1) issuer shall (a) a consolidate or merge with or into another person or subsidiary of another person unless the beneficial owners of issuer&#146;s then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own securities representing 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of then outstanding voting securities of the resulting or acquiring corporation (or any parent thereof), or their equivalent if other than a corporation, or (b) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of issuer to another person, or (c) be the subject of a purchase, tender or exchange offer that is accepted by the holders of more than the 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock (not including any shares of common stock held by the person or persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the persons making or party to, such purchase, tender or exchange offer), or (d) consummate a stock purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another person whereby such other person or parent of such other person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock (not including any shares of common stock held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or party to, such stock purchase agreement or other business combination), (2) any time issuer&#146;s continuing directors do not constitute a majority of issuer&#146;s board of directors (or, if applicable, a successor entity), or (3) a termination of trading of the common stock. upon a &#147;significant transaction&#148; as defined in the notes, noteholders may require issuer to redeem all (but not less than all) of their 8% convertible notes for a price equal to the principal amount then outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such principal and any accrued and unpaid late charges with respect to such principal and interest. a &#147;significant transaction&#148; generally means any &#147;fundamental transaction&#148; as defined in the note, or other corporate transaction, or series of transactions, (including but not limited to, any acquisition, disposition, merger, license or collaboration, joint venture, financing or securities offering) that would result in either (x) the issuance of common stock and/or convertible securities that would exceed 40% of the common stock outstanding prior to the transaction or (y) the payment or receipt of cash or other consideration of in excess of $25 million, unless such transaction has been approved by the two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% convertible notes then outstanding. commencing upon the one year anniversary of the effective date, issuer can prepay the 8% convertible notes, in full or in part, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on not less than 30 days&#146; but not more than 60 days&#146; prior notice. during such notice period, the note holders can convert their 8% convertible notes into issuer&#146;s common stock at the then current conversion price. if issuer sends a notice to the holders stating that it is redeeming the 8% convertible notes, and then fails to pay the redemption price within five business days of the date set for redemption, the holders can request that issuer re-issue the notes surrendered for redemption or conversion and issuer will be required to reduce the conversion price of the 8% convertible notes to equal the lower of (a) the then-existing conversion price and (b) the lowest closing bid price of its common stock during the redemption period. upon the closing of the merger, as required by the note exchange agreement and the merger agreement, issuer filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation that (i) requires the issuer to maintain a board of directors with no more than seven members, and requires that each committee of the board would have no more than three members; and (ii) provides that three members of the board of directors shall be elected by holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of the 8% convertible notes, voting as a class and that, subject to applicable law, table of contents cusip no. 42224h104 13d page 18 of 22 pages two of the directors appointed by the noteholders (chosen by majority vote of the noteholders) will have the right, but not the obligation, to serve as members of the committees of the board of directors of issuer. the provisions of issuer&#146;s certificate of incorporation that relate to the board rights described above will apply only so long as 30% of the original $12.5 million principal amount of the notes remain outstanding. on august 6, 2007, elizabeth czerepak was appointed to issuer&#146;s board of directors as one of the three initial noteholder representatives. ms. czerepak is a managing partner of management. upon an event of default the principal and accrued interest becomes due and payable. as defined under the notes, an event of default includes the following events: (1) issuer&#146;s failure to pay to the noteholder any amount of principal when and as due; (2) issuer&#146;s failure to pay to the noteholder any amount of interest, late charges or other amounts when and as due under the 8% convertible notes if such failure continues for a period of at least thirty business days; (3) any acceleration prior to maturity of any indebtedness of issuer or any of its subsidiaries which individually or in the aggregate is equal to or greater than $250,000 in principal amount; (4) certain bankruptcy events with respect to issuer or its material subsidiaries; (5) certain judgments for the payment of money in the amount in excess of $5 million remaining unpaid for sixty days after the entry of such judgments; (6) a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of issuer in the merger agreement, note exchange agreement or registration rights agreement that continues for at least thirty days after notice to issuer from a noteholder; and (7) failure of the issuer to appoint the noteholder representatives to its board, described above, as required. description of options on january 18, 2006, former pharmathene granted elizabeth czerepak, as a director, options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock of former pharmathene. ms. czerepak subsequently assigned her interest in these options to the bshi funds, in proportion to their relative share ownership interests in former pharmathene. in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, these options were assumed by the issuer in the merger. following the merger, they represent the option to purchase 996 shares of common stock of the issuer at an exercise price of $4.22, and will expire on january 18, 2016, the tenth anniversary of their original issuance by former pharmathene. the options vest as to one quarter (25%) of the underlying shares on each anniversary of the initial issuance of the option by former pharmathene. registration rights agreement on the effective date, in connection with the closing of the merger, the issuer entered into a registration rights agreement with the bshi funds and other holders of former pharmathene equity securities. under the registration rights agreement, issuer agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission within 60 days of the effective date in order to register for resale all shares of common stock held by the parties to the registration rights agreement, including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 8% convertible notes. the issuer agreed to cause the registration statement to become effective as soon as possible after filing it, and to keep the registration statement continuously effective until such time as all registered securities have been sold. holders of a majority of the then-outstanding &#147;registrable securities&#148;, as defined in the registration rights agreement, can also demand that issuer make two additional registrations at any time that is 180 days after the effective date, but before the fifth year anniversary of the merger. if holders of two-thirds of the registrable securities request, any registration statement filed pursuant to the demand provisions of the registration rights agreement will be made with respect to an underwritten offering. parties to the registration rights agreement also have standard piggy-back rights which would permit them to include shares on another registration statement prepared and filed by issuer. issuer and each other party to the registration rights agreement, including the bshi funds, have agreed to indemnify the other with respect to certain liabilities that may be incurred under the securities act of 1933, as amended. milestone payments pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, issuer has agreed that the former pharmathene stockholders, including the bshi funds, would be entitled to additional consideration (the &#147;milestone payments&#148;) equal to 10% of the actual collections on gross sales of valortim to the united states federal government (or a department thereof) table of contents cusip no. 42224h104 13d page 19 of 22 pages until the earlier of (a) december 31, 2009, or (b) the time at which total aggregate milestone payments to such holders equal $10 million. the milestone payments are conditioned upon receipt by issuer of an award, procurement or other contract (x) on or before december 31, 2007; (y) which provides for a procurement by the u.s. government (or a department thereof) of doses or treatments equal to or greater than 60,000; and (z) with a total contract value of $150 million or more. if these conditions are not satisfied, no milestone payments will be paid or due.

thereof) of gross sales, and will be paid within three business days of such determination. other relationships bear, stearns &#038; co., inc. was retained by former pharmathene to advise former
