page 3 of 7 item 1. security and issuer. this schedule 13d (this "schedule 13d") relates to the series a convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "preferred stock"), of multi-link telecommunications, inc., a colorado corporation (the "company"), which has its principal executive offices at 5555 triangle parkway, suite 300, norcross, georgia 30092. item 2. identity and background. this statement is being filed by philip s. pesin, a citizen of the united states ("pesin" or the "reporting person"). pesin is the chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company. the principal business address of pesin is c/o multi-link telecommunications, inc., 5555 triangle parkway, suite 300, norcross, georgia 30092. during the last five years, none of the individuals or entities identified in this item 2 has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors) or been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding, was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on may 17, 2006, the company completed a merger (the "merger") with auriga laboratories, inc., a delaware corporation ("auriga"). the merger was effected pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger ("merger agreement"), entered into on may 4, 2006, by and among the company, auriga and multi-link acquisition, inc. a newly formed delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the company ("subsidiary"). pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the subsidiary was merged with and into auriga, with auriga as the surviving entity. auriga will continue its business under the name auriga laboratories, inc. as a subsidiary of the company and will retain its certificate of incorporation and bylaws. following the merger, the separate existence of subsidiary ceased. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of auriga ("auriga common stock") for shares of the company's preferred stock. at the closing of the merger ("closing"), in exchange for the auriga common stock, the company issued to the stockholders of auriga ("auriga stockholders") 1,000,042 shares of preferred stock which will be convertible into 494,977,491 shares of the company's common stock ("conversion shares"). each outstanding share of auriga common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.0606392 shares of preferred stock and each outstanding option and warrant to purchase one (1) share of auriga common stock was assumed by the company and was converted into an option or warrant to purchase 30.013762 shares of the company's common stock (with the exercise price being adjusted accordingly). the beneficial ownership of the company's preferred stock reported in this schedule 13d by the reporting person is based on such reporting person's ownership of auriga common stock prior to the closing. the company plans to promptly seek approval from its stockholders to reincorporate in delaware, effect a 1 for 15 reverse stock split (the "reverse split"), adopt a stock incentive plan and change the company's corporate name to auriga laboratories, inc. (collectively the "actions"). at the closing, ki equity partners i, llc, and auriga stockholders holding at least a majority of the preferred stock received in the merger, including the reporting person, entered into a voting agreement, whereby the parties agreed to vote their shares of the company's voting securities to approve the actions. the voting agreement terminates upon approval of the actions. the preferred stock will immediately and automatically be converted into shares of the company's common stock (the "mandatory conversion") upon the approval by a majority of the company's stockholders (voting together on an as-converted-to-common-stock basis), following the merger, of the reverse split. the holders of shares of preferred stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of the company's common stock, as a single class, upon all matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. each share of preferred stock is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable as if converted at the record date. as such, the auriga stockholders have approximately 93% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the company stock entitled to vote. page 4 of 7 item 4. purpose of transaction. reference is made to the disclosure set forth under item 3 of this schedule 13d, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. the shares of common stock to which this schedule 13d relates are held by the reporting person as an investment. the reporting person disclaims any membership in a group relating to the company, except with respect to the actions described above, to which the reporting person has agreed to vote.. as a result of the closing, the reporting person collectively owns 28.9% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the company's capital stock. the reporting person anticipates taking action to approve the actions. these actions will cause the mandatory conversion. upon the occurrence of the mandatory conversion and the reverse split, the company's currently issued and outstanding series a convertible preferred stock (currently1,000,042 shares), will be converted into 494,977,491 shares of common stock (without giving effect to the reverse split), and will represent approximately 93% of the company's total common stock issued and outstanding. after giving effect to the reverse split, the auriga shareholders will receive approximately 32,998,564 shares of the company's common stock. other than as described in this schedule 13d, the reporting person is not aware of any plans or proposals which would result in the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company or the disposition of securities of the company; any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any place or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the company's board; any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; any changes in company's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person;
