the issuer, with the issuer continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent (the &#147;merger&#148;). if the merger is consummated, then the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the payment of related transaction fees and expenses will be financed from the following sources: (i) up to $85.0 million in equity financing to be provided or secured by abry vi or other parties to whom abry vi assigns a portion of its commitment, pursuant to an equity commitment letter, by and between abry vi and parent, dated as of november 1, 2010 (the &#147;first equity commitment letter&#148;), and (ii) approximately $100.0 million to be funded either by abry vi or from borrowings under a new senior credit facility with the issuer&#146;s existing lender or such other lender as parent determines. abry vi&#146;s obligation to fund the equity financing contemplated by the first equity commitment letter is subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions to parent and merger sub&#146;s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. additionally, pursuant to a second equity commitment letter, by and between abry vi and parent, dated as of november 1, 2010 (the &#147;second equity commitment letter&#148;), abry vi has committed to make or secure capital contributions to parent at or prior to the closing of the merger of up to $3.8 million for the sole purpose of satisfying claims for monetary damages arising out of parent and merger sub&#146;s obligations under the merger agreement in the event that the merger is not consummated as a result of the election of the issuer to terminate the merger agreement because (i) there has been a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by parent or merger sub in the merger agreement or any such representation or warranty becomes untrue or incorrect after the date of the merger agreement, which breach or failure to be true or correct would give rise to the failure of the condition to the closing of the merger relating to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of parent and merger sub or compliance by parent and merger sub with their obligations under the merger agreement, and such breach or failure is not cured within certain notice periods, or (ii) the issuer has satisfied its conditions to parent and merger sub&#146;s obligations to consummate the merger, and following notice by the issuer to parent of its readiness to close the merger, parent and merger sub fail to close the merger within two business days following the date on which the closing should have occurred under the merger agreement. the foregoing descriptions of the first equity commitment letter and the second equity commitment letter do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the first equity commitment letter and the second equity commitment letter, as applicable, which are attached hereto as exhibits 2 and 3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. as of the date of this schedule 13d, the reporting persons have not paid any funds or other consideration for

of common stock of the issuer issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of common stock owned by (i) parent, merger sub, the issuer or any of their subsidiaries, or (ii) stockholders of the issuer who have properly exercised and not withdrawn appraisal rights under delaware law) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $2.50 in cash (the &#147;common per share merger consideration&#148;), without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. the merger agreement also provides that, at the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of the issuer&#146;s series 2003a convertible preferred stock, series 2003b convertible preferred stock and series 2004a convertible preferred stock (collectively, the &#147;preferred stock&#148;) will be converted into the right to receive the amount per share of series 2003a convertible preferred stock, series 2003b convertible preferred stock and series 2004a convertible preferred stock, respectively, that represents in each such case $2.50 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, per share of common stock on an as-converted basis, assuming conversion of all of such preferred stock to common stock as of the closing date of the merger (and in each case other than shares of preferred stock owned by (i) parent, merger sub, the issuer or any of their subsidiaries, or (ii) stockholders of the issuer who have properly exercised and not withdrawn appraisal rights under delaware law). in addition, the merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each outstanding option to acquire shares of common stock, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such option, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of the common per share merger consideration over the exercise price per share of such option, less any applicable withholding taxes. the respective obligations of the issuer, parent and merger sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the issuer&#146;s stockholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the merger agreement. the foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the merger agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by

flynn, and robert f. ende and their affiliates, including related trusts (collectively, the &#147;stockholders&#148;), each entered into a voting and support agreement, dated as of november 1, 2010 (collectively, the &#147;voting and support agreements&#148;), with parent and merger sub with respect to an aggregate of 5,389,453 shares of common stock and 13,398 shares of preferred stock and any additional shares of common stock or preferred stock acquired by the stockholders, including pursuant to the exercise of options to acquire shares of common stock (the &#147;subject shares,&#148; and the common stock included in the subject shares, the &#147;voting shares&#148;). under the voting and support agreements, each stockholder agreed that, at every meeting of the stockholders of the issuer called to vote, such stockholder will vote all voting shares: (i) in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, and (ii) against any action or agreement which would in any material respect impede, interfere with or prevent the merger, against any acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), and against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of such stockholder under the voting and support agreements. each stockholder also granted to parent a proxy to vote the voting shares owned by such stockholder with respect to any of the foregoing matters at any meeting of the issuer&#146;s stockholders and in any action by written consent of the issuer&#146;s stockholders. pursuant to the applicable voting and support agreement, each stockholder also agreed not to (a) transfer any of the subject shares or create any encumbrances, or consent to any of the foregoing, (b) enter into any contract with respect to any transfer of the subject shares, (c) grant any proxy or other authorization or consent with respect to any of the subject shares that is inconsistent with the merger agreement or such stockholder&#146;s voting and support agreement, (d) deposit any of the subject shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting and support agreement with respect to the subject shares, or (e) knowingly take any other action that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of such stockholder&#146;s obligations under such stockholder&#146;s voting and support agreement. each stockholder under such stockholder&#146;s voting and support agreement waived any rights of appraisal or similar rights under any applicable law in connection with the merger. each stockholder also agreed not to solicit or take any other action that would facilitate any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, to engage in negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal, or execute any agreement relating to any acquisition proposal. one of the purposes of the voting and support agreements is to
