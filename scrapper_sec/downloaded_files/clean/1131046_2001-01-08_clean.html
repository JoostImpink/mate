(b) mr. fares may be deemed to beneficially own and thereby share voting and dispositive power over the shares of common stock described herein which are held by wedge engineering. see item 2. (c) see item 3. (d) and (e) not applicable. page 13 of 18 14 item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. upon closing of the hbi transaction, wedge and the issuer entered into a shareholder agreement (the "shareholder agreement"), dated as of december 28, 2000. standstill provisions the shareholder agreement contains so-called "standstill" provisions which, among other things, (i) prohibit the purchase of additional shares by wedge (whether by tender offer or otherwise) except in order to maintain a 10% ownership stake, and (ii) prohibit acquisition proposals, proxy solicitations, group formation or encouragement of third parties for takeover purposes by wedge. with respect to any proposed business combination or recapitalization involving the issuer and any third party, wedge must vote or tender its shares or otherwise act as recommended by the supervisory board of the issuer (or any special committee of the supervisory board of the issuer constituted for the purpose of evaluating such proposed transaction). wedge will be free to submit a competing offer for the issuer only in the event that the supervisory board of the issuer determines to sell control of the issuer to another party. the shareholder agreement provides that in the event of a breach of any covenants or agreements contained therein, the aggrieved party (including any present or future shareholders of the issuer) shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance, injunction or other equitable relief. in the event of a breach by wedge of the "standstill" provisions discussed above (whether by the launching of a tender offer or otherwise), the issuer and/or its shareholders may seek injunctive relief. however, as such relief is equitable in nature and at the discretion of the court in which such action is brought, there can be no assurance that such court will grant such relief. supervisory board representation the shareholder agreement contains certain provisions intended to implement the right of wedge to elect supervisory directors to the supervisory board of the issuer. the number of supervisory directors comprising the supervisory board was expanded from eight to twelve and wedge will have the right to designate two supervisory directors so long as it owns 17 1/2 % of the issuer's voting securities outstanding. the number of supervisory directors that wedge is entitled to designate will decrease with a reduction of its percentage ownership of voting securities and will terminate completely once such ownership falls below 10% of the issuer's voting securities outstanding for any period of 30 consecutive days. the supervisory board regulations shall provide that a special committee of the supervisory board composed entirely of disinterested, independent supervisory directors shall be constituted to evaluate any significant transactions (primarily transactions involving a change of control) and any transactions or issues involving wedge. as long as wedge is entitled to designate at least two supervisory directors on the supervisory board, it will be entitled to representation on the committees of the supervisory board other than the nominating committee and the special committee described immediately above. voting restrictions pursuant to the shareholder agreement, wedge agreed that, with respect to any matter presented to the issuer's shareholders for vote or approval, each will vote "for" the nominees page 14 of 18 15 recommended by the supervisory board (provided the issuer is in compliance with its covenants to wedge relating to supervisory board representation), "for" any proposal recommended by the supervisory board, and "against" any proposal that is not recommended by the supervisory board, with the exception of the following matters as to which wedge will have discretionary voting rights: (i) appointment of auditors, (ii) adoption of any rights agreement which would restrict wedge from effecting any transaction not otherwise prohibited by the shareholder agreement, (iii) migration of the issuer to another organizational jurisdiction (other than in connection with a business combination), (iv) conversion of the issuer's corporate form (other than in connection with a business combination), and (v) proposed amendments to the issuer's articles of association which would have a disproportionate material and adverse effect on wedge versus the issuer's other shareholders not contemplated by the shareholder agreement. transfer restrictions and registration rights the shareholder agreement contains certain restrictions on the transfer of shares held by wedge. without the issuer's consent, wedge may not sell any of its shares to (a) any person or group who is or would be required to file a schedule 13d under the exchange act, (b) any person or group who would own more than 10% of the issuer's voting securities, or (c) a competitor of the issuer. any

(b) cb&i will not include in any demand registration any securities which are not holders' securities without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the holders' securities to be included in such demand registration. if a demand registration is an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of the number of holders' securities and other securities requested to be included creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not holders' securities, the number of holders' securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without creating such a risk, pro rata among the respective holders of holders' securities on the basis of the number of holders' securities owned by such holders, with further successive pro rata allocations among the holders of holders' securities if any such a-9 86 holder of holders' securities has requested the registration of less than all such holders' securities such holder is entitled to register.

(b) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of cb&i and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities that cb&i proposes to sell, second, the holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the first reserve shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such holders' securities on the basis of the number of shares which are owned by such holders, and third, other securities requested to be included in such registration to be allocated pro rata among the holders thereof. (c) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of cb&i's securities and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration and the holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the first reserve shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of shares of securities or holders' securities which are owned by such holders, and second, other securities requested to be included in such registration.

(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 3.06 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand, or the indemnified party on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or a-17 94 omission, but not by reference to any indemnified party's stock ownership in cb&i. in no event, however, shall a selling holder be required to contribute in excess of the amount of the net proceeds received by such selling holder in connection with the sale of holders' securities in the offering which is the subject of such loss, claim, damage or liability. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this paragraph, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) conflicts and controlling language. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. section 3.07 participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by such person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. the foregoing notwithstanding, with respect to any of the documents and/or agreements referred to in this section 3.07, (i) no selling holder of holders' securities shall be required to make any representations and warranties with respect to or on behalf of cb&i or any other shareholder of cb&i and (ii) the liability of any holder of holders' securities shall be limited as provided in section 3.06(b). section 3.08 information by selling holder. selling holders shall promptly furnish to cb&i such information regarding such selling holders as shall be necessary to enable cb&i to comply with the provisions hereof in connection with any registration referred to in this agreement. section 3.09 rule 144 reporting. at the request of any selling holder of holders' securities who proposes to sell securities in compliance with rule 144 of the commission, cb&i will (i) forthwith furnish to such selling holder a written statement of compliance with the filing requirements of the commission as set forth in rule 144, as such rule may be amended from time to time and (ii) make available to the public and such holders such information as will enable the selling holders of holders' securities to make sales pursuant to rule 144. a-18 95 section 3.10 consistent restrictions on transfer. cb&i shall be permitted, and it shall not constitute a breach of the terms of this article iii, to impose restrictions on transfer of holders' securities under a registration statement consistent with the terms of article iv hereof. article iv transfers of holders' securities section 4.01 restrictions on transfer.

(b) the parties hereto agree that the articles of association shall be amended (i) to provide that any affiliate transaction involving frf or its affiliates or any business combination with a third party or recapitalization otherwise requiring a shareholder vote shall require approval by at least 80% of the voting securities then outstanding at a time when any person (and its affiliates and associates) or "group" owns 15% or more of the voting securities then outstanding, and (ii) in such other respects listed on annex a hereto as is necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions and purposes of this agreement. section 2.03 voting of holders' securities. frf agrees that during the term of this agreement, with respect to any matter presented to shareholders of cb&i for vote or approval (whether at a meeting or by written consent), each class of holders' securities owned by frf and its affiliates and associates shall be present and voted (i) "for" the nominees recommended by the supervisory board, provided cb&i is in compliance with the terms of section 6.01 of this agreement, and (ii) "for" any proposal which is recommended by the supervisory board and "against" any proposal that is not recommended by the supervisory board; provided, however, that frf and its affiliates may, in their sole discretion, vote the securities held by them on any matter involving (i) the appointment of auditors; (ii) the adoption of any rights agreement or any other "poison pill" or similar shareholder rights plan which would preclude frf from effecting any transaction otherwise permitted herein; (iii) the migration of cb&i from its current organization state to any other organization state (other than in connection with a business combination with a third party); (iv) the conversion of cb&i from its current corporate form to any other corporate form (other than in connection with a business combination with a third party); or (v) the amendment of the articles of association as to matters not contemplated by this agreement which would have a disproportionate material and adverse effect on frf versus other cb&i shareholders not contemplated by this agreement. the provisions of this section 2.03 shall apply to both the casting of votes at general meetings of shareholders and any execution of shareholder action by written consent. frf agrees, and shall cause its affiliates, to execute and deliver to the secretary of cb&i not later than 20 days prior to the date of any general meeting of shareholders of cb&i a proxy (in such form as provided by and on behalf of the supervisory board) representing all voting securities beneficially owned by frf and its a-40 117 affiliates and associates voted in accordance with the provisions of this section 2.03 and this agreement. article iii registration rights section 3.01 demand registration. (a) subject to the terms of this agreement, at any time after the date hereof, the holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding holders' securities may request registration under the securities act of all or part of their holders' securities on form s-1 or s-3 or any similar registration (other than a shelf registration); provided, that any such request shall cover either (i) at least 20% of such holders' securities calculated as of the date of this agreement or (ii) such smaller number to the extent it represents all of the remaining holders' securities. within ten (10) days after receipt of any request pursuant to this section 3.01, cb&i will give written notice of such request to all other holders of holders' securities and will include in such registration all holders' securities with respect to which cb&i has received written requests for inclusion within thirty (30) days after delivery of cb&i's notice. all registrations requested pursuant to this section 3.01 are referred to herein as "demand registrations." (b) cb&i will not include in any demand registration any securities which are not holders' securities without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the holders' securities to be included in such demand registration. if a demand registration is an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of the number of holders' securities and other securities requested to be included creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not holders' securities, the number of holders' securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without creating such a risk, pro rata among the respective holders of holders' securities on the basis of the number of holders' securities owned by such holders, with further successive pro rata allocations among the holders of holders' securities if any such holder of holders' securities has requested the registration of less than all such holders' securities such holder is entitled to register. (c) notwithstanding any of the foregoing, cb&i shall not be obligated to effect any demand registration as follows: (i) cb&i will not be obligated to effect more than one demand registration within any twelve month period; (ii) cb&i will not be obligated to effect any demand registration during the a-41 118 period starting on the date 60 days prior to cb&i's estimated date of filing of, and ending on the date 90 days immediately following the effective date of, any registration statement pertaining to securities of cb&i sold by cb&i, provided that cb&i is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; and provided further that cb&i may not, pursuant to this section 3.01(c)(ii), delay implementation of a demand registration more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (iii) with respect to any demand registration, if (a) the supervisory board reasonably and in good faith determines that such filing would be materially detrimental to cb&i or require a disclosure of a material fact that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on cb&i or on any plan or proposal by cb&i or any of its subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition or disposition of assets or equity securities (other than in the ordinary course of business ) or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, material financing or other significant transaction and (b) cb&i shall furnish the holders of holders' securities who have requested a demand registration a certificate signed by an executive officer of cb&i to such effect, cb&i may postpone for up to ninety (90) days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration; provided, however, that cb&i may not postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration for more than ninety (90) days during any twelve (12) month period; and (iv) cb&i will not be obligated to effect any demand registration after cb&i has effected two (2) demand registrations pursuant to this section 3.01, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective. section 3.02 piggyback registration. (a) whenever cb&i proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act (other than pursuant to a demand registration hereunder) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of any holders' securities (a "piggyback registration") (except forms s-8 or s-4), cb&i will give written notice, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed filing of a registration statement, to all holders of the holders' securities of its intention to effect such a registration and will use reasonable best efforts to include in such registration all holders' securities (in accordance with the priorities set forth in sections 3.02(b) and 3.02(c) below) with respect to which cb&i has received written requests for inclusion within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of cb&i's notice, specifying the number of securities intended to be registered. (b) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of cb&i and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities that cb&i proposes to sell, second, the holders' securities requested to be included a-42 119 in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the wedge shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such holders' securities on the basis of the number of shares which are owned by such holders, and third, other securities requested to be included in such registration to be allocated pro rata among the holders thereof. (c) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of cb&i's securities and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration and the holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the wedge shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of shares of securities or holders' securities which are owned by such holders, and second, other securities requested to be included in such registration. (d) if cb&i has previously filed a registration statement with respect to holders' securities pursuant to section 3.01 or pursuant to this section 3.02, and if such previous registration has not been withdrawn or abandoned, cb&i will not file or cause to be effected any other registration of any of its securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for its securities under the securities act (except on form s-8 or form s-4 or any successor form thereto), whether on its own behalf or at the request of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least one hundred eighty (180) days has elapsed from the effective date of such previous registration. section 3.03 right to terminate registration. cb&i shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under section 3.02 prior to the effectiveness of such registration provided that no holder has elected to include holders' securities in such registration. section 3.04 expenses of registration. (a) cb&i will pay all registration expenses for demand registrations pursuant to section 3.01 and for an unlimited number of piggyback registrations pursuant to section 3.02, provided, however, that cb&i shall not be obligated to pay more than $400,000 in the aggregate for registration expenses with respect to demand registrations. a registration will not count as one of the cb&i paid demand registrations until it has become effective; provided, however, that in any event cb&i will pay all registration expenses in connection with any registration initiated as a demand registration for which cb&i was obligated to pay. in excess of $400,000, the registration expenses for demand registrations shall be borne by the holders of holders' securities to be registered thereunder pro rata based on the number of holders' securities and other securities requested or permitted to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms a-43 120 of this agreement. if frf effects a piggyback registration right hereunder relating to a demand registration by wedge group incorporated under the wedge shareholder agreement, frf agrees to share pro rata with wedge group incorporated any registration expenses which exceed the amount cb&i is obligated to pay, and cb&i will cause any other person which has a right to effect a piggyback registration relating to a demand registration by frf hereunder to agree to similarly share such registration expenses. (b) except as provided in section 3.04(a) hereof, all expenses incident to cb&i's performance of or compliance with this agreement, including, but not limited to, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel for cb&i and all independent certified public accountants, underwriters (excluding discounts and commissions) and other persons retained by cb&i (all such expenses being herein called "registration expenses"), will be borne by cb&i, provided that cb&i shall not be required to pay sales commissions, discounts or transfer taxes or the cost of legal counsel for the holders. in addition, cb&i will pay its internal expenses (including, but not limited to, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expense of any liability insurance obtained by cb&i, and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each securities exchange. if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of a majority of the holders of holders' securities to be registered, the holders of holders' securities shall forfeit their right to reimbursement of expenses with respect to one demand registration unless the holders of holders' securities to be registered pay for all of the registration expenses for such withdrawn registration or unless such registration is withdrawn due to a material adverse change in the operations or results of cb&i. section 3.05 registration procedures. whenever the holders of holders' securities have requested that any holders' securities be registered pursuant to this agreement, cb&i will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such holders' securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, cb&i will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such holders' securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective (provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, cb&i will furnish copies of all such documents proposed to be filed to the counsel or counsels for the selling holders of the holders' securities covered by such registration statement); (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus(es) used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective until the earlier of such time as all of such holders' a-44 121 securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition set forth in such registration statement or the expiration of 135 days after such registration statement becomes effective (provided that such 135-day period shall be extended (i) in the case of a demand registration for such number of days that equals the number of days elapsing from (a) the date written notice contemplated by section 3.05(e) hereof is given by cb&i to (b) the date on which cb&i delivers to the selling holders the supplement or amendment contemplated by section 3.05(e) hereof and (ii) for a period of time equal to the period the holder refrains from selling any holders' securities included in such registration at the request of cb&i or an underwriter), and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the selling holders thereof set forth in such registration statement; (c) furnish to each selling holder of holders' securities such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus(es) included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such selling holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the holders' securities owned by such selling holder; (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such holders' securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such selling holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the holders' securities owned by such selling holder (provided that cb&i will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph, (ii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction); (e) notify each selling holder of such holders' securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, cb&i will prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such holders' securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (f) cause all such holders' securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by cb&i are then listed or if no such securities are then listed, such securities exchange as the selling holders of a majority of the holders' securities included in such registration may request; a-45 122 (g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such holders' securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; (h) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all such other customary actions as the selling holders of a majority of the holders' securities being sold or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such holders' securities (including, but not limited to, effecting a stock split or a combination of shares); (i) make available for inspection by any selling holder of holders' securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such selling holder or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of cb&i, and cause cb&i's officers, directors, employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such selling holder, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that any records, information or documents that are furnished by cb&i and that are non-public shall be used only in connection with such registration and shall be kept strictly confidential by any selling holder of holders' securities except to the extent disclosure of such records, information or documents is required by written order of a court or other governmental authority having jurisdiction; (j) advise each selling holder of such holders' securities, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued; and (k) furnish on the date or dates provided for in the underwriting agreement: (i) an opinion of counsel, addressed to the underwriters, covering such matters as such counsel and underwriters may reasonably agree upon, including such matters as are customarily furnished in connection with an underwritten offering, and (ii) a letter or letters from the independent certified public accountants of cb&i addressed to the underwriters, covering such matters as such accountants and underwriters may reasonably agree upon, in which letter(s) such accountants shall state, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that they are independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the securities act and that in their opinion the financial statements and other financial data of cb&i included in the registration statement, the prospectus(es), or any amendment or supplement thereto, comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the securities act. a-46 123 section 3.06 indemnification; contribution. (a) by cb&i. to the extent permitted by law, (i) cb&i will indemnify each selling holder, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, with respect to which registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to cb&i by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after cb&i has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same), or any violation by cb&i of the securities act or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act applicable to cb&i in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and (ii) cb&i will reimburse each such selling holder, each of its officers, directors, and each person controlling such selling holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing, settling or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided, in the case of (i) and (ii), any indemnification by cb&i shall be proportionate to reflect the relative fault of cb&i on the one hand, and the selling holder on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, claims, losses, damages, liabilities or action in respect thereof, as well as any other equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by cb&i or the selling holder, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to stock ownership in cb&i. (b) by selling holders. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder (i) will indemnify cb&i, each of its officers and directors, and each underwriter, if any, of securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls cb&i or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each other selling holder, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact a-47 124 required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) will reimburse cb&i, such selling holders, such officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, but, in the case of (i) and (ii), only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to cb&i for the acknowledged purpose of inclusion in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each selling holder under this subsection (b) shall be limited in an amount equal to the net proceeds of the shares sold by such selling holder, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful misconduct by such selling holder. (c) procedure for indemnification. each party indemnified under subsection (a) or (b) of this section 3.06 (the "indemnified party") shall, promptly after receipt of actual notice of any claim or the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought, notify the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof, provided that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party on account of the indemnity agreement contained in subsection (a) or (b) of this section 3.06, unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability which it may have to such indemnified party. if any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable (except to the extent the proviso to this sentence is applicable, in which event it will be so liable) to the indemnified party under this section 3.06 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that each indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent it and assume its defense (in which case, the indemnifying party shall not represent it) if (i) upon the advice of counsel, the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (ii) in the event the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof within 10 days of receipt of notice of such claim or commencement of action, and in which case the fees and expenses of one such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm for all such indemnified parties, unless conflicting a-48 125 interests of the indemnified parties make the retention of one firm on behalf of all of them unreasonable. if any indemnified party employs such separate counsel it will not enter into any settlement agreement which is not approved by the indemnifying party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnifying party so assumes the defense thereof, it may not agree to any settlement of any such claim or action as the result of which any remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the indemnified party, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. in any action hereunder as to which the indemnifying party has assumed the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall not be obligated hereunder to reimburse the indemnified party for the costs thereof. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 3.06 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand, or the indemnified party on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to any indemnified party's stock ownership in cb&i. in no event, however, shall a selling holder be required to contribute in excess of the amount of the net proceeds received by such selling holder in connection with the sale of holders' securities in the offering which is the subject of such loss, claim, damage or liability. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this paragraph, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. a-49 126 (e) conflicts and controlling language. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. section 3.07 participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by such person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. the foregoing notwithstanding, with respect to any of the documents and/or agreements referred to in this section 3.07, (i) no selling holder of holders' securities shall be required to make any representations and warranties with respect to or on behalf of cb&i or any other shareholder of cb&i and (ii) the liability of any holder of holders' securities shall be limited as provided in section 3.06(b). section 3.08 information by selling holder. selling holders shall promptly furnish to cb&i such information regarding such selling holders as shall be necessary to enable cb&i to comply with the provisions hereof in connection with any registration referred to in this agreement. section 3.09 rule 144 reporting. at the request of any selling holder of holders' securities who proposes to sell securities in compliance with rule 144 of the commission, cb&i will (i) forthwith furnish to such selling holder a written statement of compliance with the filing requirements of the commission as set forth in rule 144, as such rule may be amended from time to time and (ii) make available to the public and such holders such information as will enable the selling holders of holders' securities to make sales pursuant to rule 144. section 3.10 consistent restrictions on transfer. cb&i shall be permitted, and it shall not constitute a breach of the terms of this article iii, to impose restrictions on transfer of holders' securities under a registration statement consistent with the terms of article iv hereof. article iv transfers of holders' securities section 4.01 restrictions on transfer.

(a) wgi agrees that, so long as this agreement remains in effect, with respect to any proposed business combination or recapitalization involving cb&i or any affiliate of cb&i and any third party, each class of holders' securities owned by wgi and its affiliates and associates will only be voted, or tendered or exchanged (or withheld or withdrawn from tender or exchange), and wgi and its affiliates and associates will otherwise act, only in accordance with the recommendation of the supervisory board (and any special committee of the supervisory board constituted for the purpose of evaluating one or more such proposals). subject to such restriction, wgi shall not be prohibited by the provisions of section 2.01 from submitting a competing business combination or recapitalization proposal to the supervisory board in the event that the supervisory board publicly announces its determination to recommend a significant transaction to cb&i shareholders subsequent to the effective time. (b) the parties hereto agree that the articles of association shall be amended (i) to provide that any affiliate transaction involving wgi or its affiliates or any business combination with a third party or recapitalization otherwise requiring a shareholder vote shall require approval by at least 80% of the voting securities then outstanding at a time when any person (and its affiliates and associates) or "group" owns 15% or more of the voting securities then outstanding, and (ii) in such other respects listed on annex a hereto as is necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions and purposes of this agreement. section 2.03 voting of holders' securities. wgi agrees that during the term of this agreement, with respect to any matter presented to shareholders of cb&i for vote or approval (whether at a meeting or by written consent), each class of holders' securities owned by wgi and its affiliates and associates shall be present and voted (i) "for" the nominees recommended by the supervisory board, provided cb&i is in compliance with the terms of section 6.01 of this agreement, and (ii) "for" any proposal which is recommended by the supervisory board and "against" any proposal that is not recommended by the supervisory board; provided, however, that wgi and its affiliates may, in their sole discretion, vote the securities held by them on any matter involving (i) the appointment of auditors; (ii) the adoption of any rights agreement or any other "poison pill" or similar shareholder rights plan which would preclude seller from effecting any transaction otherwise permitted herein; (iii) the migration of cb&i from its current organization state to any other organization state (other than in connection with a business combination with a third party); (iv) the conversion of cb&i from its current corporate form to any other corporate form (other than in connection with a business combination with a third party); or (v) the amendment of the articles of association as to matters not contemplated by this agreement which would have a disproportionate material and adverse effect on wgi versus other cb&i shareholders not contemplated by this agreement. the provisions of this section 2.03 shall apply to both the casting of votes at general meetings of shareholders and any execution of shareholder action by written consent. wgi agrees, and shall cause its affiliates, to execute and deliver to the secretary of cb&i not later than 20 days prior to the date of any general meeting of shareholders of cb&i a proxy (in such form as provided by and on behalf of the supervisory board) representing all voting securities beneficially owned by wgi and its affiliates and associates voted in accordance with the provisions of this section 2.03 and this agreement. 8 9 article iii registration rights section 3.01 demand registration. (a) subject to the terms of this agreement, at any time after the date hereof, the holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding holders' securities may request registration under the securities act of all or part of their holders' securities on form s-1 or s-3 or any similar registration (other than a shelf registration); provided, that any such request shall cover either (i) at least 20% of such holders' securities calculated as of the date of this agreement or (ii) such smaller number to the extent it represents all of the remaining holders' securities. within ten (10) days after receipt of any request pursuant to this section 3.01, cb&i will give written notice of such request to all other holders of holders' securities and will include in such registration all holders' securities with respect to which cb&i has received written requests for inclusion within thirty (30) days after delivery of cb&i's notice. all registrations requested pursuant to this section 3.01 are referred to herein as "demand registrations." (b) cb&i will not include in any demand registration any securities which are not holders' securities without the written consent of the holders of a majority of the holders' securities to be included in such demand registration. if a demand registration is an underwritten public offering and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of the number of holders' securities and other securities requested to be included creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration, prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not holders' securities, the number of holders' securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without creating such a risk, pro rata among the respective holders of holders' securities on the basis of the number of holders' securities owned by such holders, with further successive pro rata allocations among the holders of holders' securities if any such holder of holders' securities has requested the registration of less than all such holders' securities such holder is entitled to register. (c) notwithstanding any of the foregoing, cb&i shall not be obligated to effect any demand registration as follows: (i) cb&i will not be obligated to effect more than one demand registration within any twelve month period; (ii) cb&i will not be obligated to effect any demand registration during the period starting on the date 60 days prior to cb&i's estimated date of filing of, and ending on the 9 10 date 90 days immediately following the effective date of, any registration statement pertaining to securities of cb&i sold by cb&i, provided that cb&i is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; and provided further that cb&i may not, pursuant to this section 3.01(c)(ii), delay implementation of a demand registration more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (iii) with respect to any demand registration, if (a) the supervisory board reasonably and in good faith determines that such filing would be materially detrimental to cb&i or require a disclosure of a material fact that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on cb&i or on any plan or proposal by cb&i or any of its subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition or disposition of assets or equity securities (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, material financing or other significant transaction and (b) cb&i shall furnish the holders of holders' securities who have requested a demand registration a certificate signed by an executive officer of cb&i to such effect, cb&i may postpone for up to ninety (90) days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration; provided, however, that cb&i may not postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration for more than ninety (90) days during any twelve (12) month period; and (iv) cb&i will not be obligated to effect any demand registration after cb&i has effected two (2) demand registrations pursuant to this section 3.01, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective. section 3.02 piggyback registration. (a) whenever cb&i proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act (other than pursuant to a demand registration hereunder) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of any holders' securities (a "piggyback registration") (except forms s-8 or s-4), cb&i will give written notice, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed filing of a registration statement, to all holders of the holders' securities of its intention to effect such a registration and will use reasonable best efforts to include in such registration all holders' securities (in accordance with the priorities set forth in sections 3.02(b) and 3.02(c) below) with respect to which cb&i has received written requests for inclusion within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of cb&i's notice, specifying the number of securities intended to be registered. (b) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of cb&i and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities that cb&i proposes to sell, second, the holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the first reserve shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such holders' securities on the basis of the number of shares which are owned by 10 11 such holders, and third, other securities requested to be included in such registration to be allocated pro rata among the holders thereof. (c) if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of cb&i's securities and the managing underwriters advise cb&i in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in the registration creates a substantial risk that the price per share of securities will be reduced, cb&i will include in such registration first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration if and only if pursuant to a demand registration exercised by pdm, second, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration, and the holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under this agreement together with any holders' securities requested to be included in such registration under the first reserve shareholder agreement, pro rata among all the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of shares of securities or holders' securities which are owned by such holders, and third, other securities requested to be included in such registration. (d) if cb&i has previously filed a registration statement with respect to holders' securities pursuant to section 3.01 or pursuant to this section 3.02, and if such previous registration has not been withdrawn or abandoned, cb&i will not file or cause to be effected any other registration of any of its securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for its securities under the securities act (except on form s-8 or form s-4 or any successor form thereto), whether on its own behalf or at the request of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least one hundred eighty (180) days has elapsed from the effective date of such previous registration. section 3.03 right to terminate registration. cb&i shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under section 3.02 prior to the effectiveness of such registration provided that no holder has elected to include holders' securities in such registration. section 3.04 expenses of registration. (a) cb&i will pay all registration expenses for demand registrations pursuant to section 3.01 and for an unlimited number of piggyback registrations pursuant to section 3.02, provided, however, that cb&i shall not be obligated to pay more than $400,000 in the aggregate for registration expenses with respect to demand registrations. a registration will not count as one of the cb&i paid demand registrations until it has become effective; provided, however, that in any event cb&i will pay all registration expenses in connection with any registration initiated as a demand registration for which cb&i was obligated to pay. in excess of $400,000, the registration expenses for demand registrations shall be borne by the holders of holders' securities to be registered thereunder pro rata based on the number of holders' securities and other securities requested or permitted to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms of this agreement. if wgi effects a piggyback registration right hereunder relating to a demand registration by first reserve under the first reserve shareholder agreement, wgi 11 12 agrees to share pro rata with first reserve any registration expenses which exceed the amount cb&i is obligated to pay, and cb&i will cause any other person which has a right to effect a piggyback registration relating to a demand registration by wgi hereunder to agree to similarly share such registration expenses. (b) except as provided in section 3.04(a) hereof, all expenses incident to cb&i's performance of or compliance with this agreement, including, but not limited to, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel for cb&i and all independent certified public accountants, underwriters (excluding discounts and commissions) and other persons retained by cb&i (all such expenses being herein called "registration expenses"), will be borne by cb&i, provided that cb&i shall not be required to pay sales commissions, discounts or transfer taxes or the cost of legal counsel for the holders. in addition, cb&i will pay its internal expenses (including, but not limited to, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expense of any liability insurance obtained by cb&i, and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each securities exchange. if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of a majority of the holders of holders' securities to be registered, the holders of holders' securities shall forfeit their right to reimbursement of expenses with respect to one demand registration unless the holders of holders' securities to be registered pay for all of the registration expenses for such withdrawn registration or unless such registration is withdrawn due to a material adverse change in the operations or results of cb&i. section 3.05 registration procedures. whenever the holders of holders' securities have requested that any holders' securities be registered pursuant to this agreement, cb&i will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such holders' securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, cb&i will as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such holders' securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective (provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, cb&i will furnish copies of all such documents proposed to be filed to the counsel or counsels for the selling holders of the holders' securities covered by such registration statement); (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus(es) used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective until the earlier of such time as all of such holders' securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition set forth in such registration statement or the expiration of 135 days after such registration statement becomes effective (provided that such 135-day period shall be extended (i) in the case of a demand registration for such number of days that equals the number of days elapsing from (a) 12 13 the date written notice contemplated by section 3.05(e) hereof is given by cb&i to (b) the date on which cb&i delivers to the selling holders the supplement or amendment contemplated by section 3.05(e) hereof and (ii) for a period of time equal to the period the holder refrains from selling any holders' securities included in such registration at the request of cb&i or an underwriter), and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the selling holders thereof set forth in such registration statement; (c) furnish to each selling holder of holders' securities such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus(es) included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such selling holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the holders' securities owned by such selling holder; (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such holders' securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such selling holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the holders' securities owned by such selling holder (provided that cb&i will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph, (ii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction); (e) notify each selling holder of such holders' securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, cb&i will prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such holders' securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (f) cause all such holders' securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by cb&i are then listed or if no such securities are then listed, such securities exchange as the selling holders of a majority of the holders' securities included in such registration may request; (g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such holders' securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; (h) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all such other customary actions as the selling holders of a majority of the holders' securities being sold or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to 13 14 expedite or facilitate the disposition of such holders' securities (including, but not limited to, effecting a stock split or a combination of shares); (i) make available for inspection by any selling holder of holders' securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such selling holder or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of cb&i, and cause cb&i's officers, directors, employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such selling holder, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that any records, information or documents that are furnished by cb&i and that are non-public shall be used only in connection with such registration and shall be kept strictly confidential by any selling holder of holders' securities except to the extent disclosure of such records, information or documents is required by written order of a court or other governmental authority having jurisdiction; (j) advise each selling holder of such holders' securities, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued; and (k) furnish on the date or dates provided for in the underwriting agreement: (i) an opinion of counsel, addressed to the underwriters, covering such matters as such counsel and underwriters may reasonably agree upon, including such matters as are customarily furnished in connection with an underwritten offering, and (ii) a letter or letters from the independent certified public accountants of cb&i addressed to the underwriters, covering such matters as such accountants and underwriters may reasonably agree upon, in which letter(s) such accountants shall state, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that they are independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the securities act and that in their opinion the financial statements and other financial data of cb&i included in the registration statement, the prospectus(es), or any amendment or supplement thereto, comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the securities act. section 3.06 indemnification; contribution. (a) by cb&i. to the extent permitted by law, (i) cb&i will indemnify each selling holder, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, with respect to which registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular 14 15 or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to cb&i by such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after cb&i has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same), or any violation by cb&i of the securities act or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act applicable to cb&i in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and (ii) cb&i will reimburse each such selling holder, each of its officers, directors, and each person controlling such selling holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing, settling or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided, in the case of (i) and (ii), any indemnification by cb&i shall be proportionate to reflect the relative fault of cb&i on the one hand, and the selling holder on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, claims, losses, damages, liabilities or action in respect thereof, as well as any other equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by cb&i or the selling holder, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to stock ownership in cb&i. (b) by selling holders. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder (i) will indemnify cb&i, each of its officers and directors, and each underwriter, if any, of securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls cb&i or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each other selling holder, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such selling holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) will reimburse cb&i, such selling holders, such officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, settling or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, but, in the case of (i) and (ii), only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to cb&i for the acknowledged purpose of inclusion in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each selling holder under this subsection (b) shall be limited in an amount equal to the net proceeds of the shares sold by such selling holder, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful misconduct by such selling holder. 15 16 (c) procedure for indemnification. each party indemnified under subsection (a) or (b) of this section 3.06 (the "indemnified party") shall, promptly after receipt of actual notice of any claim or the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought, notify the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof, provided that the failure of the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party on account of the indemnity agreement contained in subsection (a) or (b) of this section 3.06, unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability which it may have to such indemnified party. if any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable (except to the extent the proviso to this sentence is applicable, in which event it will be so liable) to the indemnified party under this section 3.06 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation;

(e) so long as wgi and its affiliates and associates are entitled to designate at least two (2) wgi designees, each committee of the supervisory board (other than the nominating committee or any special committee of independent directors constituted for the purposes set forth in the last sentence of this section 6.01(e)) shall at all times include at least one wgi designee and no action by any such committee shall be valid unless taken at a meeting for which adequate notice has been duly given to or waived by the members of such committee. the wgi designee designated by wgi to serve on any committee of the supervisory board may designate as his alternate another wgi designee designated by wgi. the parties hereto agree that the regulations of the supervisory board shall provide that a special committee of the supervisory board composed entirely of disinterested independent directors shall be constituted for the purpose of evaluating (i) any significant transaction or (ii) any transaction, issue or matter involving wgi or its affiliates or associates, which special committee shall report its conclusions and recommendations to the supervisory board as a whole. (f) notwithstanding anything contained herein, if the wgi designees are not included as nominees for directors by the supervisory board or if the supervisory board does not solicit proxies for such wgi designees at any shareholders meeting required by the provisions of section 6.01(b) (whether or not such obligation is enforceable), and the company shall not have complied with said section 6.01(b) within 20 days after written notice of such breach is provided by wgi to the company (or the company shall have given written notice to 23 24 wgi during such period that it does not intend to comply), the provisions of articles ii, iv and v of this agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect. section 6.02 director compensation. wgi designees will be compensated in the same manner as other nominees or directors (including reimbursement of expenses). section 6.03 indemnification. upon the election of any wgi designee to the supervisory board, cb&i shall (a) indemnify and hold harmless (and exculpate) against any and all liabilities and claims against him as a result of his affiliation with cb&i and (b) provide to any wgi designee liability insurance, in each case of clause (a) and (b) above to the same extent provided or made available to other members of the supervisory board. article vii miscellaneous section 7.01 assignment of holders' rights; third party beneficiaries. (a) the rights and obligations of wgi under this agreement may be assigned or transferred by any holder to an assignee, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) such assignment is effected in accordance with applicable securities laws and the provisions of this agreement; (ii) such assignee agrees in writing to become subject to the terms of this agreement (provided, however, that such assignee other than an affiliate of wgi shall not have the rights of wgi under article vi hereof unless specifically agreed to by cb&i in writing); and (iii) cb&i is given written notice by such holder of such assignment, stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the holders' securities with respect to which such rights are being assigned. notwithstanding the foregoing or the restrictions set forth in article iv or article v, wgi may enter into and consummate the first reserve deal. (b) except as provided in section 7.01(a), this agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder may not be assigned and shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors. (c) this agreement is expressly intended to confer upon the present and future shareholders of cb&i (including gerald m. glenn and timothy j. wiggins as signatories hereto), as third party beneficiaries, the benefits of all covenants and agreements made by wgi herein with privity to enforce such provisions with all rights and remedies under applicable law, including the right of specific performance and injunctive relief set forth in section 7.08. each cb&i shareholder not signatory to this agreement shall be deemed to have been notified of such intended third party benefit by disclosure thereof in any public filing by cb&i concerning this agreement and, to the extent acknowledgment of such benefits is required by the law of any jurisdiction, to have acknowledged and accepted such benefits as a third party beneficiary by 24 25 casting his vote concerning the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the purchase agreement at the shareholders' meeting. section 7.02 term; effectiveness. the term of this agreement will begin (and this agreement will become effective) upon the date hereof and will continue until the date on which wgi and its affiliates and associates no longer beneficially own securities representing in the aggregate at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of voting securities then outstanding; provided, however, that the holders shall continue to have the rights provided for in article iii of this agreement as long as they beneficially own in the aggregate at least five percent (5%) of the total number of shares of voting securities then outstanding. the provisions of sections 3.04, 3.06 and 6.03 hereof shall survive the termination of this agreement. section 7.03 entire agreement;
