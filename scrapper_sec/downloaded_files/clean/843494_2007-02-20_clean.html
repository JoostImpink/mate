consideration - ------ -------------------------------------------------- the aggregate net investment cost for the $10,000,000 principal amount of notes owned in aggregate by wcp and wcip was $15,714,000.00. each of the partnerships obtained the consideration for its acquisition of the notes referenced herein from its working capital. item 4. purpose of the transaction - ------ -------------------------- as reported by the company in its form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2007 (the "company's 8-k"), on february 9, 2007 the company and its subsidiaries acquired certain brands, licenses and brand-related assets from coty inc. and certain of its affiliates. as part of that transaction, the company entered into certain financing page 8 of 17 pages arrangements, including but not limited to the securities purchase agreement with wcp and wcip described immediately below. on february 9, 2007, wcp and wcip entered into a securities purchase agreement with the company (the "securities purchase agreement"). pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the company issued to wcp and wcip in aggregate $10,000,000 in principal amount of notes. such notes mature on december 30, 2016 (subject to certain put and call rights described below) and will bear interest at the rate of 9% per annum, subject to increases to up to 15% upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of certain specified events. interest on the notes is payable in kind and shall be accrued and capitalized on a monthly basis. on february 9, 2007, the company also issued $76,000,000 in principal amount of the notes to prencen lending llc ("prencen lending") pursuant to the third amended and restated securities purchase agreement (the "prencen securities purchase agreement") among the company, prencen lending and prencen llc (as defined below) and entered into certain other agreements with affiliates of prencen lending (together with prencen lending, the "prentice parties"). the balance due under the notes (including principal, interest and certain late charges, if any, specified in the notes) is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder(s), into shares at a price of $0.42 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments, provided that wcp and wcip may not convert any amounts due under their notes if and to the extent that, following such a conversion, either of them and any of their affiliates would collectively beneficially own more than 9.99% of the aggregate number of shares outstanding following such conversion (such conversion limitation being the "conversion cap"). the $10,000,000 in principal amount of notes owned in aggregate by wcp and wcip would be convertible into 23,809,524 shares but due to the restrictions imposed by the conversion cap, only notes convertible into 1,303,445 shares are currently convertible. pursuant to the terms of the notes and after giving the company 61 days written notice, each holder of notes may decrease, and after that increase up to a limit of 9.99%, the beneficial ownership percentage specified in the conversion cap. the issuance of any shares upon conversion of the notes that exceed the aggregate number of shares that the company may issue pursuant to the rules or regulations of the american stock exchange is conditioned upon the consent of the company's stockholders to such issuance (the "stockholder's consent") and the passage of 20 days after the mailing of an information statement on schedule 14c to the company's stockholders describing, among other things, the stockholder's consent. pursuant to the voting agreement executed between the company and the stockholders of the company party thereto (the "voting agreement"), such stockholders agreed to such consent, and the stockholder's consent was obtained as of february 9, 2007. pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the company covenanted to file such information statement no later than 10 days after february 9, 2007. the purpose of the acquisition of the notes was for investment, and the acquisitions of the notes by each of the partnerships were made in the ordinary course of business and were not made for the purpose of acquiring control of the company. pursuant to the terms of the notes and if necessary to maintain the company's stockholders' equity at the level required pursuant to the continued listing standards of the american stock exchange, the company may exchange on a pro rata basis up to $40 million in principal amount of the notes (including for the avoidance of doubt the notes issued to prencen lending) for shares of a newly created series of convertible preferred stock that will be convertible into shares, on terms page 9 of 17 pages acceptable to the company and the holders of a majority of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding. as part of such exchange, the company would pay to each exchanging holder of notes a fee in cash equal to 15% of the outstanding amount of notes such holder exchanged. at any time after the eighth anniversary of the issuance date of the notes, the company (on a one-time basis) or any holder (from time-to-time) may redeem all or any portion of the balance outstanding under the notes at a premium of 7%. all of the notes are redeemable at the election of the holder(s) holding a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes at any time upon the occurrence of an event of default, generally at a premium of at least 25% (no premium may be applicable for certain bankruptcy related events of default). the notes are also redeemable by each holder upon a change of control of the company (as defined in the notes), at premiums of at least 20%. all payments to the holders of the notes are subject to the provisions of an intercreditor agreement with certain senior claimholders of the company. the holder(s) of the notes shall be entitled to such dividends, distributions, purchase or exchange rights made to holders of shares to the same extent as if such holders had converted the notes into shares (without regard to any conversion caps but subject to the provisions of an intercreditor agreement with certain senior claimholders of the company). in addition, pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement and for so long as the notes remain outstanding, each holder of notes, including wcp and wcip, has a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance or sale by the company of common stock equivalents being offered in a subsequent placement (as such terms are defined in the securities purchase agreement). pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the company agreed to increase the size of its board of directors from five members to seven members promptly after the issuance of the notes. pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement and for so long as the notes remain outstanding, the company with the unanimous approval of all members of the board of directors of the company may (subject to prencen llc's existing right to designate one member to the board of directors) increase the size of the board of directors to no more than nine members provided that one of such additional two directors is to be designated by prencen llc (except as otherwise provided in the prencen securities purchase agreement). contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the securities purchase agreement, wcp, wcip, the prentice parties and the company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "registration rights agreement") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the company agreed to provide certain registration rights with respect to any shares into which wcp and wcip's notes are converted and any other shares otherwise acquired by wcp, wcip and/or prencen llc and prencen lending llc. under the registration rights agreement, the company is required to file a registration statement with respect to the registrable securities by june 30, 2007 and to use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective not later than 60 days thereafter (or 90 days after the filing deadline if the registration statement is subject to review by the securities and exchange commission). the registration rights agreement provides for the payments of certain fees for the failure to comply with such deadlines or to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and customary registration rights including demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights. pursuant to the voting agreement described above and in addition to the stockholder's consent, the stockholders signatory to the voting agreement agreed to increase the authorized number of shares and to amend certain provisions of the company's certificate of incorporation page 10 of 17 pages (including but not limited to the elimination of article vii of the company's certificate of incorporation, which article permitted the adoption of certain compromises or arrangements between the company and its creditors and/or stockholders upon the acceptance of such compromises or arrangements by certain majorities of the company's creditors and/or stockholders). wcp and wcip are third-party beneficiaries of such agreement. wcp and wcip are also lenders under the second lien credit agreement dated as of february 9, 2007 (the "loan agreement"), by and among the company, its domestic subsidiaries, watershed administrative, llc as administrative agent and the other parties named therein. for more information regarding the loan agreement, see a copy of the loan agreement attached as an exhibit to the form 8-k filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2007. the description above of the notes, the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement, the voting agreement and the loan agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full terms and conditions of such agreements, which agreements are incorporated by reference herein. for additional information regarding these agreements, see a copy of the agreements attached as exhibits to this schedule 13d or the company's 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission filed on february 15, 2007. subject to the terms and conditions of the notes and the securities purchase agreement described above, although no reporting person has any specific plan or proposal to acquire or dispose of any notes and/or shares, consistent with its investment purpose, each reporting person at any time and from time to time may acquire additional notes and/or shares or dispose of any or all of its notes and/or shares depending upon an ongoing evaluation of the investment in the notes and/or shares, prevailing market conditions, other investment opportunities, liquidity requirements of the reporting person and/or other investment considerations. no reporting person has made a determination regarding a maximum or minimum number of notes and/or shares which it may hold at any point in time. also, consistent with their investment intent, the reporting persons may engage in communications with one or more shareholders or noteholders of the company, one or more officers of the

certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in section 29. (1) maturity. on the maturity date, the company shall pay to the holder an -------- amount in cash equal to all of the obligations then due and owing hereunder. the "maturity date" shall be december 30, 2016, as may be extended in writing at the sole option of the holder (i) in the event that an event of default (as defined in section 4(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an event of default, in which case, the maturity date shall be extended until the later of the date such event of default is cured and the date there no longer exists any event which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an event of default and (ii) through the date that is ten (10) days after the consummation of a change of control in the event that a change of control is publicly announced or a change of control notice (as defined in section 5) is delivered prior to the maturity date. on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the company shall deliver a written notice to the holder certifying that (a) (1) no event of default has occurred and is continuing and (2) no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an event of default or (b) an event specified in clause (a) has occurred and is continuing. (2) interest. interest on this note shall commence accruing on the issuance -------- date and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed and shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar month during the period beginning on the issuance date and ending on, and including, the date that this note is repaid in full (each, an "interest date") with the first interest date being february 28, 2007. interest shall be payable on each interest date, to the record holder of this note on the applicable interest date by capitalizing such interest on and as of each interest date by adding it to the then outstanding principal of this note (the "capitalized interest"). upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, or, the occurrence and continuation of any of the events described in sections 4(a)(i), 4(a)(ii), 4(a)(iii)(b), 4(a)(iv)(b), or 4(a)(vii) through 4(a)(xiii) prior to such time as the permitted senior indebtedness has been repaid in full, the interest rate on the obligations shall be increased to fifteen percent (15%). in the event that such event of default or event, as applicable, is subsequently cured, such increased interest rate shall no longer be in effect as of the date of such cure; provided that the interest as calculated at such increased rate during the continuance of such event of default or event, as applicable, shall continue to apply to the extent relating to the days after the occurrence of such event of default or event, as applicable, through and including the date of cure of such event of default or event. in addition, to the extent that the company owes the holder any permitted accrued third lien - 2 - fees/penalties (as defined in section 9 of the intercreditor agreement), such owed amounts shall, until paid by the company to the holder to the extent allowed by the intercreditor agreement, accrue interest at the then applicable interest rate under this note and the interest on such permitted accrued third lien fees/penalties shall be capitalized at the same time(s) and in the same manner that interest on the principal of this note is capitalized. (3) conversion of notes. this note shall be convertible into shares of -------------------- common stock of the company, $0.001 par value per share (the "common stock"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this section 3. (a) conversion right. subject to the provisions of section 3(d), at ----------------- any time or times on or after the issuance date, the holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid conversion amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock in accordance with section 3(c), at the conversion rate (as defined below). the company shall not issue any fraction of a share of common stock upon any conversion. if the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of common stock, the company shall round such fraction of a share of common stock up to the nearest whole share. the company shall pay any and all taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of common stock upon conversion of any portion of the conversion amount. (b) conversion rate. the number of shares of common stock issuable ---------------- upon conversion of any portion of the conversion amount pursuant to section 3(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such conversion amount by (y) the conversion price (the "conversion rate"). (i) "conversion amount" means the sum of (a) the principal under this note, (b) accrued and uncapitalized interest, with respect to such principal and (c) accrued and unpaid late charges (as defined in section 25(b)) with respect to such principal and interest. (ii) "conversion price" means, as of any conversion date (as defined below) or other date of determination, $0.42, subject to adjustment as provided herein. (c) mechanics of conversion. ----------------------- (i) optional conversion. to convert any portion of the conversion ------------------- amount into shares of common stock on any date (a "conversion date"), the holder shall (a) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., new york time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as exhibit i (the "conversion notice") to the company and (b) if required by section 3(c)(iii), surrender this note to a common carrier for delivery to the company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). on or before the first (1st) trading day following the date of receipt of a conversion notice, the company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such conversion notice - 3 - to the holder and the company's transfer agent (the "transfer agent"). on or before the third (3rd) trading day following the date of receipt of a conversion notice (the "share delivery date"), the company shall (1) provided that the transfer agent is participating in the fast automated securities transfer program of the depository trust company ("dtc") credit such aggregate number of shares of common stock to which the holder shall be entitled to the holder's or its designee's participant account with dtc through its deposit withdrawal agent commission system or (2) if the transfer agent is not participating in the dtc fast automated securities transfer program, issue and deliver no later than the share delivery date, to the address as specified in the conversion notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the holder or its designee, for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder shall be entitled. if this note is physically surrendered for conversion pursuant to section 3(c)(iii) and the outstanding principal of this note is greater than the principal portion of the conversion amount being converted, then the company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three business days after receipt of this note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) representing the outstanding principal not converted. the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of all or a portion of this note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock on the conversion date. (ii) company's failure to timely convert. if the company shall ------------------------------------- fail to issue a certificate to the holder or credit the holder's participant account with dtc for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder is entitled upon conversion of any portion of the conversion amount on or prior to the date which is five (5) trading days after the conversion date (a "conversion failure"), then (a) the company shall pay damages to the holder for each day of such conversion failure until the earlier of the date such failure is cured and the revocation date (as defined below) in an amount equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock not issued to the holder on or prior to the share delivery date and to which the holder is entitled, and (ii) the closing sale price of the common stock on the share delivery date and (b) the holder, upon written notice to the company, may void its conversion notice with respect to, and retain or have returned, as the case may be, any portion of this note that has not been converted pursuant to such conversion notice (the date such notice is given, the "revocation date"); provided that the voiding of a conversion notice shall not affect the company's obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to this section 3(c)(ii) or otherwise and once such payment is made no conversion failure shall exist with respect to such voided portion of such conversion. in addition to the foregoing, if within three (3) trading days after the company's receipt of the facsimile copy of a conversion notice the company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to the holder or credit the holder's participant account with dtc for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any portion of the conversion amount, and if on or after such scheduled share delivery date the holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) common stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the holder of common stock issuable upon such conversion that the holder anticipated receiving from the company (a "buy-in"), then the company - 4 - shall, within three (3) trading days after the holder's request and in the holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of common stock so purchased (the "buy-in price"), at which point the company's obligation to deliver such certificate or credit such holder's participant account with dtc (and to issue such common stock) shall terminate and the conversion amount of this note shall be reduced by the conversion amount applicable to such portion of the failed conversion notice, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the holder a certificate or certificates representing such common stock or credit such holder's participant account with dtc and pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the buy-in price over the product of (a) such number of shares of common stock, times (b) the closing bid price on the conversion date. (iii) registration; book-entry. the company shall maintain a ------------------------- register (the "register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the holders of each note and the principal amount of the notes held by such holders (the "registered notes"). the entries in the register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. the company and the holders of the notes shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the register as the owner of a note for all purposes, including, without limitation, the right to receive payments of principal and interest hereunder, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. a registered note may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the register. upon its receipt of a request to assign or sell all or part of any registered note by a holder, the company shall record the information contained therein in the register and issue one or more new registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount as the principal amount of the surrendered registered note to the designated assignee or transferee pursuant to section 19. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this note in accordance with the terms hereof, the holder shall not be required to physically surrender this note to the company unless (a) the full conversion amount represented by this note is being converted or (b) the holder has provided the company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a conversion notice) requesting reissuance of this note upon physical surrender. the holder and the company shall maintain records showing the principal converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the holder and the company, so as not to necessitate the physical surrender of this note upon conversion. (iv) pro rata conversion; disputes. in the event that the company ----------------------------- receives a conversion notice from more than one holder of notes for the same conversion date and the company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of the notes submitted for conversion, the company, subject to section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of notes electing to have notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all notes submitted for conversion on such date; provided, however, that no holder shall receive shares of common stock upon conversion of its note in excess of its authorized share allocation (as defined in section 11(a)); provided, further, - 5 - however, such pro rata conversion shall not cure any default or event of default occurring hereunder resulting from such failure to fully effect the conversion otherwise required by this note. in the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of common stock issuable to the holder in connection with a conversion of this note, the company shall issue to the holder the number of shares of common stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with section 24. (d) limitations on conversions. -------------------------- (i) beneficial ownership. the company shall not effect any --------------------- conversion of this note, and the holder of this note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this note pursuant to section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, and taking into account all other shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates, the holder (together with the holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the "maximum percentage") of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. for purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of common stock which would be issuable upon (a) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this note beneficially owned by the holder or any of its affiliates and (b) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the company (including, without limitation, any other notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the holder or any of its affiliates, in each case if such conversion or exercise of such instrument is not permitted in order to keep the holder's beneficial ownership of common stock at or below the maximum percentage. except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. for purposes of this section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of common stock, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of common stock as reflected in (x) the company's most recent form 10-k, form 10-q or form 8-k, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the company or (z) any other notice by the company or the transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of common stock outstanding. for any reason and at any time, upon the written or oral request of the holder, the company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in writing to the holder the number of shares of common stock then outstanding. in any case, the number of outstanding shares of common stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the company, including this note, by the holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of common stock was reported. by written notice to the company, the holder may from time to time increase or decrease the maximum percentage to any other percentage specified in such notice so long as such specified maximum percentage shall not exceed 9.99%; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is - 6 - delivered to the company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder and not to any other holder of notes. (ii) principal market regulation. without limiting the rights of --------------------------- the holder under section 11 hereunder, the company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of this note, the other notes or the preferred shares or exercise of the warrants, and the holder of this note shall not have the right to receive upon conversion of this note any shares of common stock, if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock which the company may issue upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the notes, the preferred shares and warrants without breaching the company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the principal market (the "exchange cap"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the company (a) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the principal market for issuances of common stock in excess of such amount or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the required holders. until such approval or written opinion is obtained, (1) the watershed funds (as defined in section 15(h)) shall not be issued in the aggregate upon conversion of the watershed notes shares of common stock in an amount greater than 11.6% of the exchange cap and (2) the prencen group shall not be issued in the aggregate, upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the prencen note, preferred shares or warrants, shares of common stock in an amount greater than 88.4% of the exchange cap (with respect to each of the watershed funds and the prencen group, the "exchange cap allocation"). in the event that any of the watershed funds and/or the prencen group shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's exchange cap allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the exchange cap allocation allocated to such transferee. in the event that any holder of notes shall convert all of such holder's notes into a number of shares of common stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's exchange cap allocation, then the difference between such holder's exchange cap allocation and the number of shares of common stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective exchange cap allocations of the remaining holders of notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the notes then held by each such holder. (e) holder's right of exchange. to the extent, but only to the extent, -------------------------- required by the principal market pursuant to its listing requirements at any time following the consummation of the acquisition, up to $40,000,000 in outstanding principal amount of the notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and late charges on such principal and interest, if any (such amount, the "exchange amount") shall be exchanged on a pro rata basis (the "exchange") for a new series of convertible preferred stock that will be convertible into the company's common stock (the "new securities") of the company, which new securities shall have such rights, designations and preferences as the required holders and the company shall mutually agree. upon the consummation of the exchange, the company shall (i) deliver to the holder the holder pro rata amount of the new securities and (ii) pay to the holder, in cash, an amount equal to 15% of the holder pro rata amount of the - 7 - exchange amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the holder's written wire transfer instructions.

or (xiv) any event of default (as defined in the other notes) occurs with respect to any other notes. (b) redemption right. upon the occurrence of an event of default with ----------------- respect to this note or any other note, the company shall within one (1) business day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (an "event of default notice") to all of the holders of notes. subject to the intercreditor agreement, at any time after the earlier of the holders' receipt of an event of default notice and the holders becoming aware of an event of default, a holder of notes may elect to require the company to redeem all of its note by delivering written notice thereof (the "event of default redemption notice") to the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall only be required to consummate a redemption pursuant to this section 4(b) upon the company's receipt of event of default redemption notices from one or more holders of notes constituting the required holders (the "event of default redemption trigger date") and the company shall notify all of the holders of the notes of the receipt of such redemption notices promptly, but in no event later than (1) business day, following the event of default redemption trigger date; provided, however, if an event of default exists at the maturity date, any holder of the notes may exercise its right to require the redemption by the company of such holder's note under this section 4(b). subject to the intercreditor agreement, as of the event of default redemption trigger date, the company shall be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes in accordance with this section 4(b). each note redeemed by the company pursuant to this section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the portion of the conversion amount to be redeemed and (y) the redemption premium and (ii) the product of (a) the conversion rate with respect to such conversion amount in - 10 - effect at such time as the required holders deliver an event of default redemption notice and (b) the greatest of the closing sale price of the common stock on the date immediately preceding such event of default, the closing sale price of the common stock on the date immediately following such event of default and the closing sale price of the common stock on the event of default redemption trigger date (the "event of default redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12. to the extent redemptions required by this section 4(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the note by the company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. the parties hereto agree that in the event of the company's redemption of all or a portion of such note under this section 4(b), the holders' damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the holders. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 4(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the holders' actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 4, but subject to section 3(d), until the holder receives the event of default redemption price, the holder may convert this note, in whole or in part, into common stock pursuant to section 3, and any such conversion shall reduce the amount otherwise redeemable pursuant to this section 4. (c) absence of event of default in certain circumstances. --------------------------------------------------------------- notwithstanding anything in this note to the contrary, until the permitted senior indebtedness has been repaid in full, no event of default shall occur under this note or any other note or any other transaction document unless an event of default has occurred or contemporaneously occurs under and pursuant to the terms of the permitted senior indebtedness. (5) rights upon fundamental transaction and change of control. --------------------------------------------------------- (a) assumption. the company shall not enter into or be party to a ---------- fundamental transaction unless (i) the successor entity assumes in writing all of the obligations of the company under this note and the other transaction documents in accordance with the provisions of this section 5(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the required holders and approved by the required holders prior to such fundamental transaction, including agreements to deliver to each holder of notes in exchange for such notes a security of the successor entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount and interest rate equal to the principal amounts and the interest rates of the notes held by such holder, having similar conversion rights as the notes and having similar ranking to the notes, and satisfactory to the required holders and (ii) the successor entity (including its parent entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an eligible market. upon the occurrence of any fundamental transaction, the successor entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such fundamental transaction, the provisions of this note referring to the "company" shall refer instead to the successor entity), and may exercise every right and power of the company and shall assume all of the obligations of the company under this note with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named as the company herein. upon - 11 - consummation of the fundamental transaction, the successor entity shall deliver to the holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of this note at any time after the consummation of the fundamental transaction, in lieu of the shares of common stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the conversion of the notes prior to such fundamental transaction, such shares of publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the successor entity, and the conversion price of this note in effect immediately prior to such fundamental transaction shall be adjusted so that upon conversion of this note immediately after such fundamental transaction the holder shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number of shares of the successor entity that the holder would have been entitled to receive if the note had been converted immediately prior to such fundamental transaction, as adjusted thereafter in accordance with the provisions of this note. the provisions of this section shall apply similarly and equally to successive fundamental transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this note. (b) redemption right. no sooner than fifteen (15) days nor later than ----------------- ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a change of control, but not prior to the public announcement of such change of control, the company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the holder (a "change of control notice"). subject to the intercreditor agreement, at any time during the period beginning after the holder's receipt of a change of control notice and ending twenty (20) trading days after the consummation of such change of control, the holder may require the company to redeem all or any portion of this note by delivering written notice thereof ("change of control redemption notice") to the company, which change of control redemption notice shall indicate that portion of the conversion amount the holder is electing to redeem. the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 5 shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) that portion of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (a) the greatest of the closing sale price of the common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control, the closing sale price immediately following the public announcement of such proposed change of control and the closing sale price of the common stock immediately prior to the public announcement of such proposed change of control by (b) the conversion price and (ii) 120% of that portion of the conversion amount being redeemed (the "change of control redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 5 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12 and shall have priority to payments to stockholders in connection with a change of control. to the extent redemptions required by this section 5(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of this note by the company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 5, but subject to section 3(d), until the change of control redemption price is paid in full, that portion of the conversion amount submitted for redemption under this section 5(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holder into common stock pursuant to section 3. the parties hereto agree that in the event of the company's redemption of any portion of this note under this section 5(b), the holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the holder. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 5(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. - 12 - (6) rights upon issuance of purchase rights and other corporate events. ------------------------------------------------------------------ (a) purchase rights. if at any time the company grants, issues or ---------------- sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (other than the existing stockholder warrants (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)) pro rata to the record holders of any class of common stock (the "purchase rights"), then the holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such purchase rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of common stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights. (b) other corporate events. in addition to and not in substitution for ---------------------- any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any fundamental transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock (a "corporate event"), the company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this note, at the holder's option, (i) in addition to the shares of common stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of common stock had such shares of common stock been held by the holder upon the consummation of such corporate event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this note) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of common stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the consummation of such corporate event in such amounts as the holder would have been entitled to receive had this note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of common stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the conversion rate. provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the required holders. the provisions of this section shall apply similarly and equally to successive corporate events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this note. (7) rights upon issuance of other securities. ---------------------------------------- (a) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of common stock. if ------------------------------------------------------------- and whenever on or after the issuance date, the company issues or sells, or in accordance with this section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of common stock owned or held by or for the account of the company, but excluding shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the company in connection with any excluded security) for a consideration per share less than a price (the "applicable price") equal to the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (the foregoing a "dilutive issuance"), then immediately upon such dilutive issuance, the conversion price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to - 13 - the lowest price per share at which any share of common stock were issued or sold or deemed to be issued or sold (in accordance with this section 7(a)) in connection with such dilutive issuance; provided, however, that if the company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock in a dilutive issuance that is a permitted financing, then immediately after such dilutive issuance, the conversion price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (a) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance and (b) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of (i) the product derived by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance and the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such dilutive issuance plus (ii) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon such dilutive issuance, by (2) the product derived by multiplying (i) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance by (ii) the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately after such dilutive issuance. for purposes of determining the adjusted conversion price under this section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of options. if the company in any manner grants or ------------------- sells any options and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of such option is less than the conversion price, immediately prior thereto, then each such share of common stock underlying such option shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the granting or sale of such option for such price per share. for purposes of this section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of such option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to any one share of common stock upon granting or sale of the option, upon exercise of the option and upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible security issuable upon exercise of such option. no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of common stock or of such convertible securities upon the exercise of such options or upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible securities. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any ------------------------------------ manner issues or sells any convertible securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise thereof is less than the conversion price, immediately prior thereto, then each such share of common stock underlying such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities for such price per share. for the purposes of this section 7(a)(ii), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to any one share of common stock upon the issuance or sale of the convertible security and upon the conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible security. - 14 - no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of common stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible securities, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustment of the conversion price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 7(a), no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (iii) change in option price or rate of conversion. if the ------------------------------------------------- purchase price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exchange or exercise of any convertible securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock changes at any time, the conversion price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the conversion price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. for purposes of this section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any option or convertible security that was outstanding as of the issuance date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such option or convertible security and the common stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. no adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the conversion price then in effect. (iv) calculation of consideration received. in case any option is ------------------------------------- issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such options by the parties thereto, the options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company will be the closing sale price of such securities on the date of receipt. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the company and the required holders. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "valuation event"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within fourteen (14) business days after the tenth (10th) day following the valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the company and the required holders. the determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding - 15 - upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. (v) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of ----------- common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or in convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (b) adjustment of conversion price upon subdivision or combination of ------------------------------------------------------------------ common stock. if the company at any time on or after the issuance date ------------- subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. if the company at any time on or after the issuance date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) other events. if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the ------------ provisions of this section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights, other rights with equity features or any distribution or dividend of securities on the preferred stock of the company existing on the date hereof), then the company's board of directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the conversion price so as to protect the rights of the holder under this note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the conversion price as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 7. the company shall within one (1) business day notify each of the holders of any of the notes of any change to the conversion price and describe in reasonable detail the basis for such change. (8) holder's right of optional redemption. from time to time on and after -------------------------------------- the eighth (8th) anniversary of the issuance date, the holder shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that the company redeem (each, a "holder optional redemption") up to all of the then applicable conversion amount of this note (the "available holder optional redemption amount") by delivering written notice thereof (a "holder optional redemption notice") to the company. the holder optional redemption notice shall indicate the conversion amount of the available holder optional redemption amount the holder is electing to have redeemed (the "holder optional redemption amount"). the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 8 shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to 107% of the holder optional redemption amount (the "holder optional redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 8 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8, but subject to section 3(d), until the holder receives the holder optional redemption price, the holder optional redemption amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holder into - 16 - common stock pursuant to section 3, and any such conversion shall reduce the holder optional redemption amount in the manner set forth by the holder in the applicable conversion notice. (9) optional redemptions at the company's election. ---------------------------------------------- (a) general. at any time from and after the eighth (8th) anniversary ------- of the issuance date, so long as there has been no equity conditions failure, the company shall have the right, to redeem all or any portion of the conversion amount then remaining under this note (the "optional redemption amount") as designated in the optional redemption notice, as of the optional redemption date (an "optional redemption"). the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 9(a) shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to the 107% of the conversion amount being redeemed (the "optional redemption price"). the company may exercise its right to require redemption under this section 9 by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the holders of notes (the "optional redemption notice" and the date all of the holders received such notice is referred to as the "optional redemption notice date") and each optional redemption notice shall be irrevocable. the optional redemption notice shall state (1) the date on which the optional redemption shall occur (the "optional redemption date") which date shall be not less than five (5) trading days nor more than thirty (30) trading days after the optional redemption notice date, and (2) the aggregate conversion amount of the notes which the company has elected to be subject to optional redemption from all of the holders of the notes pursuant to this section 9(a) (and analogous provisions under the other notes) on the optional redemption date. the company may not effect more than one (1) optional redemption. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 9(a), until the optional redemption price is paid, in full, the optional redemption amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holders into shares of common stock pursuant to section 3. all conversion amounts converted by the holder into such common stock after the optional redemption notice date shall reduce the optional redemption amount of this note required to be redeemed on the optional redemption date. redemptions made pursuant to this section 9 shall be made in accordance with section 12. (b) pro rata redemption requirement. if the company elects to cause an ------------------------------- optional redemption with respect to this note pursuant to section 9(a), then it must simultaneously take the same action with respect to the other notes and make simultaneous payments of the applicable amounts to be paid to each holder of the other notes. if the company elects to cause an optional redemption pursuant to section 9(a) (or similar provisions under the other notes) with respect to less than all of the conversion amounts of the notes then outstanding, then the company shall require a proportionate redemption of a conversion amount from each of the holders of the notes equal to the product of (i) the aggregate conversion amount of all the notes which the company has elected to cause to be redeemed pursuant to section 9(a), multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion amount of the applicable note on the optional redemption date and the denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate conversion amounts of all notes on the optional redemption date (such fraction with respect to each holder is referred to as its "redemption allocation percentage", and such amount with respect to each holder is referred to as its "pro rata redemption amount"), in the event that a holder of any notes shall sell - 17 - or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's redemption allocation percentage and pro rata redemption amount. (10) noncircumvention. the company hereby covenants and agrees that the ---------------- company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the holder of this note. (11) reservation of authorized shares. -------------------------------- (a) reservation. commencing on the issuance date and until the ----------- authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, the company shall reserve in respect of the conversion of the notes not less than 100,000,000 shares of common stock. immediately on and after the authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, the company shall reserve out of its authorized and unissued common stock a number of shares of common stock for each of the notes equal to 130% of the conversion rate with respect to the conversion amount of each of the notes as of the issuance date and, for so long thereafter as any of the notes are outstanding, the company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the notes, 130% of the number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of common stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "required reserve amount"). the initial number of shares of common stock reserved for conversions of the notes and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the notes based on the principal amount (including capitalized interest) of the notes held by each holder at the issuance date or on the date of any increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "authorized share allocation"). in the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's authorized share allocation. any shares of common stock reserved and allocated to any person which ceases to hold a prencen note or watershed note, respectively, shall be re-allocated to the remaining holders of each prencen note or watershed note, respectively, pro rata based on the principal amount (including capitalized interest) of such notes then held by such holders. (b) insufficient authorized shares. if at any time after the --------------------------------- authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, while any of the notes remain outstanding the company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and reserved shares of common stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the notes at least a number of shares of common stock equal to the required reserve amount (an "authorized share failure"), then the company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the company's authorized - 18 - shares of common stock to an amount sufficient to allow the company to reserve the required reserve amount for the notes then outstanding. without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (12) redemptions. ----------- (a) mechanics. subject to section 12(b), the company shall deliver the --------- applicable event of default redemption price to the holder within seven (7) business days after the event of default redemption trigger date. subject to section 12(b), if the holder has submitted a change of control redemption notice in accordance with section 5(b), the company shall deliver the applicable change of control redemption price to the holder concurrently with the consummation of such change of control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such change of control and within five (5) business days after the company's receipt of such notice otherwise. subject to section 12(b), the company shall deliver the holder optional redemption price to the holder within five (5) business days after the company's receipt of the holder optional redemption notice. the company shall deliver the optional redemption price to the holder on the applicable optional redemption date. subject to pro rata redemption requirement in section 25(c), in the event of a redemption of less than all of the conversion amount of this note, the company shall (at the holder's request) promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the holder a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) representing the outstanding principal which has not been redeemed. in the event that the company does not pay the applicable redemption price to the holder within the time period required, at any time thereafter and until the company pays such unpaid redemption price in full, the holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the company to promptly return to the holder all or any portion of this note representing the conversion amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable redemption price (together with any late charges thereon) has not been paid. upon the company's receipt of such notice, (x) the redemption notice shall be null and void with respect to such conversion amount, (y) the company shall, at the holder's request, immediately return this note, or issue a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) to the holder representing such conversion amount and (z) the conversion price of this note or such new notes and all of the other outstanding notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (a) the conversion price as in effect on the date on which the redemption notice is voided and (b) the lowest closing bid price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the redemption notice is delivered to the company and ending on and including the date on which the redemption notice is voided. the holder's delivery of a notice voiding a redemption notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the company's obligations to capitalize late charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the conversion amount subject to such notice. - 19 - (b) redemption by other holders. notwithstanding anything else ------------------------------ contained herein, upon the company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in section 4(b), section 5(b) or section 8 (each, an "other redemption notice"), the company shall immediately, but no later than one (1) business day of its receipt thereof), forward to the holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. if the company receives a redemption notice and one or more other redemption notices, during the fifteen (15) business day period beginning on and including the date which is seven (7) business days prior to the company's receipt of the holder's redemption notice and ending on and including the date which is seven (7) business days after the company's receipt of the holder's redemption notice and the company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such redemption notice(s) and such other redemption notices received during such fifteen (15) business day period (the last day of such fifteen-day period, the "consolidation date"), then the company shall redeem on the consolidation date a pro rata amount from each holder of the notes (including the holder) based on the applicable conversion amounts of the notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such redemption notice(s) and such other redemption notices received by the company during such fifteen (15) business day period, provided, however, such pro rata payment shall not cure any default or event of default occurring hereunder resulting from such failure to fully pay the amount otherwise due on this note. (13) security. the obligations are secured to the extent and in the manner -------- set forth in the security documents. (14) voting rights. the holder shall have no voting rights as the holder of ------------- this note, except as required by law, including but not limited to the delaware general corporation law, and as expressly provided in this note. (15) covenants. --------- (a) rank. all payments due under this note (i) shall rank pari passu ---- with all of the notes and (ii) shall be senior to all other indebtedness of the company and its subsidiaries other than permitted senior indebtedness and indebtedness that is permitted to be senior or pari passu to the permitted senior indebtedness pursuant to the terms of the permitted senior indebtedness.

(c) mechanics of conversion. ----------------------- (i) optional conversion. to convert any portion of the conversion ------------------- amount into shares of common stock on any date (a "conversion date"), the holder shall (a) transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., new york time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as exhibit i (the "conversion notice") to the company and (b) if required by section 3(c)(iii), surrender this note to a common carrier for delivery to the company as soon as practicable on or following such date (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to this note in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). on or before the first (1st) trading day following the date of receipt of a conversion notice, the company shall transmit by facsimile a confirmation of receipt of such conversion notice - 3 - to the holder and the company's transfer agent (the "transfer agent"). on or before the third (3rd) trading day following the date of receipt of a conversion notice (the "share delivery date"), the company shall (1) provided that the transfer agent is participating in the fast automated securities transfer program of the depository trust company ("dtc") credit such aggregate number of shares of common stock to which the holder shall be entitled to the holder's or its designee's participant account with dtc through its deposit withdrawal agent commission system or (2) if the transfer agent is not participating in the dtc fast automated securities transfer program, issue and deliver no later than the share delivery date, to the address as specified in the conversion notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the holder or its designee, for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder shall be entitled. if this note is physically surrendered for conversion pursuant to section 3(c)(iii) and the outstanding principal of this note is greater than the principal portion of the conversion amount being converted, then the company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three business days after receipt of this note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) representing the outstanding principal not converted. the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of all or a portion of this note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock on the conversion date. (ii) company's failure to timely convert. if the company shall ------------------------------------- fail to issue a certificate to the holder or credit the holder's participant account with dtc for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder is entitled upon conversion of any portion of the conversion amount on or prior to the date which is five (5) trading days after the conversion date (a "conversion failure"), then (a) the company shall pay damages to the holder for each day of such conversion failure until the earlier of the date such failure is cured and the revocation date (as defined below) in an amount equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock not issued to the holder on or prior to the share delivery date and to which the holder is entitled, and (ii) the closing sale price of the common stock on the share delivery date and (b) the holder, upon written notice to the company, may void its conversion notice with respect to, and retain or have returned, as the case may be, any portion of this note that has not been converted pursuant to such conversion notice (the date such notice is given, the "revocation date"); provided that the voiding of a conversion notice shall not affect the company's obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to this section 3(c)(ii) or otherwise and once such payment is made no conversion failure shall exist with respect to such voided portion of such conversion. in addition to the foregoing, if within three (3) trading days after the company's receipt of the facsimile copy of a conversion notice the company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to the holder or credit the holder's participant account with dtc for the number of shares of common stock to which the holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any portion of the conversion amount, and if on or after such scheduled share delivery date the holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) common stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the holder of common stock issuable upon such conversion that the holder anticipated receiving from the company (a "buy-in"), then the company - 4 - shall, within three (3) trading days after the holder's request and in the holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of common stock so purchased (the "buy-in price"), at which point the company's obligation to deliver such certificate or credit such holder's participant account with dtc (and to issue such common stock) shall terminate and the conversion amount of this note shall be reduced by the conversion amount applicable to such portion of the failed conversion notice, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the holder a certificate or certificates representing such common stock or credit such holder's participant account with dtc and pay cash to the holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the buy-in price over the product of (a) such number of shares of common stock, times (b) the closing bid price on the conversion date. (iii) registration; book-entry. the company shall maintain a ------------------------- register (the "register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the holders of each note and the principal amount of the notes held by such holders (the "registered notes"). the entries in the register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. the company and the holders of the notes shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the register as the owner of a note for all purposes, including, without limitation, the right to receive payments of principal and interest hereunder, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. a registered note may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the register. upon its receipt of a request to assign or sell all or part of any registered note by a holder, the company shall record the information contained therein in the register and issue one or more new registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount as the principal amount of the surrendered registered note to the designated assignee or transferee pursuant to section 19. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this note in accordance with the terms hereof, the holder shall not be required to physically surrender this note to the company unless (a) the full conversion amount represented by this note is being converted or (b) the holder has provided the company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a conversion notice) requesting reissuance of this note upon physical surrender. the holder and the company shall maintain records showing the principal converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the holder and the company, so as not to necessitate the physical surrender of this note upon conversion. (iv) pro rata conversion; disputes. in the event that the company ----------------------------- receives a conversion notice from more than one holder of notes for the same conversion date and the company can convert some, but not all, of such portions of the notes submitted for conversion, the company, subject to section 3(d), shall convert from each holder of notes electing to have notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holder's portion of its notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all notes submitted for conversion on such date; provided, however, that no holder shall receive shares of common stock upon conversion of its note in excess of its authorized share allocation (as defined in section 11(a)); provided, further, - 5 - however, such pro rata conversion shall not cure any default or event of default occurring hereunder resulting from such failure to fully effect the conversion otherwise required by this note. in the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of common stock issuable to the holder in connection with a conversion of this note, the company shall issue to the holder the number of shares of common stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with section 24. (d) limitations on conversions. -------------------------- (i) beneficial ownership. the company shall not effect any --------------------- conversion of this note, and the holder of this note shall not have the right to convert any portion of this note pursuant to section 3(a), to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, and taking into account all other shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates, the holder (together with the holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the "maximum percentage") of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. for purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of common stock which would be issuable upon (a) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this note beneficially owned by the holder or any of its affiliates and (b) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the company (including, without limitation, any other notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the holder or any of its affiliates, in each case if such conversion or exercise of such instrument is not permitted in order to keep the holder's beneficial ownership of common stock at or below the maximum percentage. except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this section 3(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. for purposes of this section 3(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding shares of common stock, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of common stock as reflected in (x) the company's most recent form 10-k, form 10-q or form 8-k, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the company or (z) any other notice by the company or the transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of common stock outstanding. for any reason and at any time, upon the written or oral request of the holder, the company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in writing to the holder the number of shares of common stock then outstanding. in any case, the number of outstanding shares of common stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the company, including this note, by the holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of common stock was reported. by written notice to the company, the holder may from time to time increase or decrease the maximum percentage to any other percentage specified in such notice so long as such specified maximum percentage shall not exceed 9.99%; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is - 6 - delivered to the company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder and not to any other holder of notes. (ii) principal market regulation. without limiting the rights of --------------------------- the holder under section 11 hereunder, the company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of this note, the other notes or the preferred shares or exercise of the warrants, and the holder of this note shall not have the right to receive upon conversion of this note any shares of common stock, if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock which the company may issue upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the notes, the preferred shares and warrants without breaching the company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the principal market (the "exchange cap"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the company (a) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the principal market for issuances of common stock in excess of such amount or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the required holders. until such approval or written opinion is obtained, (1) the watershed funds (as defined in section 15(h)) shall not be issued in the aggregate upon conversion of the watershed notes shares of common stock in an amount greater than 11.6% of the exchange cap and (2) the prencen group shall not be issued in the aggregate, upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the prencen note, preferred shares or warrants, shares of common stock in an amount greater than 88.4% of the exchange cap (with respect to each of the watershed funds and the prencen group, the "exchange cap allocation"). in the event that any of the watershed funds and/or the prencen group shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's exchange cap allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the exchange cap allocation allocated to such transferee. in the event that any holder of notes shall convert all of such holder's notes into a number of shares of common stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's exchange cap allocation, then the difference between such holder's exchange cap allocation and the number of shares of common stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective exchange cap allocations of the remaining holders of notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the notes then held by each such holder. (e) holder's right of exchange. to the extent, but only to the extent, -------------------------- required by the principal market pursuant to its listing requirements at any time following the consummation of the acquisition, up to $40,000,000 in outstanding principal amount of the notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and late charges on such principal and interest, if any (such amount, the "exchange amount") shall be exchanged on a pro rata basis (the "exchange") for a new series of convertible preferred stock that will be convertible into the company's common stock (the "new securities") of the company, which new securities shall have such rights, designations and preferences as the required holders and the company shall mutually agree. upon the consummation of the exchange, the company shall (i) deliver to the holder the holder pro rata amount of the new securities and (ii) pay to the holder, in cash, an amount equal to 15% of the holder pro rata amount of the - 7 - exchange amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the holder's written wire transfer instructions.

(viii) after the permitted senior indebtedness has been repaid in full, the company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or other term or condition of any transaction document that is not specifically addressed by any other event of default set forth in this section 4(a), except, subject to clause (ii) hereof, (i) in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach continues for a period of at least ten (10) consecutive business days or (ii) in the case of any breach that arises solely by virtue of the transaction stockholder approval or the authorized share stockholder approval not being obtained at or prior to the closing date specified in the securities purchase agreements and the amendments to the certificate of incorporation of the company not having been filed with the secretary of state of delaware to effectuate the amendments specified in clauses (x) and (y) of section 4(p)(ii) of the securities purchase agreements at or prior to the closing date specified in the securities purchase agreements;

or (xiv) any event of default (as defined in the other notes) occurs with respect to any other notes. (b) redemption right. upon the occurrence of an event of default with ----------------- respect to this note or any other note, the company shall within one (1) business day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (an "event of default notice") to all of the holders of notes. subject to the intercreditor agreement, at any time after the earlier of the holders' receipt of an event of default notice and the holders becoming aware of an event of default, a holder of notes may elect to require the company to redeem all of its note by delivering written notice thereof (the "event of default redemption notice") to the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall only be required to consummate a redemption pursuant to this section 4(b) upon the company's receipt of event of default redemption notices from one or more holders of notes constituting the required holders (the "event of default redemption trigger date") and the company shall notify all of the holders of the notes of the receipt of such redemption notices promptly, but in no event later than (1) business day, following the event of default redemption trigger date; provided, however, if an event of default exists at the maturity date, any holder of the notes may exercise its right to require the redemption by the company of such holder's note under this section 4(b). subject to the intercreditor agreement, as of the event of default redemption trigger date, the company shall be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes in accordance with this section 4(b). each note redeemed by the company pursuant to this section 4(b) shall be redeemed by the company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the portion of the conversion amount to be redeemed and (y) the redemption premium and (ii) the product of (a) the conversion rate with respect to such conversion amount in - 10 - effect at such time as the required holders deliver an event of default redemption notice and (b) the greatest of the closing sale price of the common stock on the date immediately preceding such event of default, the closing sale price of the common stock on the date immediately following such event of default and the closing sale price of the common stock on the event of default redemption trigger date (the "event of default redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 4(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12. to the extent redemptions required by this section 4(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the note by the company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. the parties hereto agree that in the event of the company's redemption of all or a portion of such note under this section 4(b), the holders' damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the holders. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 4(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the holders' actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 4, but subject to section 3(d), until the holder receives the event of default redemption price, the holder may convert this note, in whole or in part, into common stock pursuant to section 3, and any such conversion shall reduce the amount otherwise redeemable pursuant to this section 4.

(b) redemption right. no sooner than fifteen (15) days nor later than ----------------- ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a change of control, but not prior to the public announcement of such change of control, the company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the holder (a "change of control notice"). subject to the intercreditor agreement, at any time during the period beginning after the holder's receipt of a change of control notice and ending twenty (20) trading days after the consummation of such change of control, the holder may require the company to redeem all or any portion of this note by delivering written notice thereof ("change of control redemption notice") to the company, which change of control redemption notice shall indicate that portion of the conversion amount the holder is electing to redeem. the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 5 shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) that portion of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the quotient determined by dividing (a) the greatest of the closing sale price of the common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control, the closing sale price immediately following the public announcement of such proposed change of control and the closing sale price of the common stock immediately prior to the public announcement of such proposed change of control by (b) the conversion price and (ii) 120% of that portion of the conversion amount being redeemed (the "change of control redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 5 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12 and shall have priority to payments to stockholders in connection with a change of control. to the extent redemptions required by this section 5(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of this note by the company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 5, but subject to section 3(d), until the change of control redemption price is paid in full, that portion of the conversion amount submitted for redemption under this section 5(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holder into common stock pursuant to section 3. the parties hereto agree that in the event of the company's redemption of any portion of this note under this section 5(b), the holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the holder. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 5(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. - 12 - (6) rights upon issuance of purchase rights and other corporate events. ------------------------------------------------------------------ (a) purchase rights. if at any time the company grants, issues or ---------------- sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (other than the existing stockholder warrants (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)) pro rata to the record holders of any class of common stock (the "purchase rights"), then the holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such purchase rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of common stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights. (b) other corporate events. in addition to and not in substitution for ---------------------- any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any fundamental transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock (a "corporate event"), the company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this note, at the holder's option, (i) in addition to the shares of common stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which the holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of common stock had such shares of common stock been held by the holder upon the consummation of such corporate event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this note) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of common stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the consummation of such corporate event in such amounts as the holder would have been entitled to receive had this note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of common stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the conversion rate. provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the required holders. the provisions of this section shall apply similarly and equally to successive corporate events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this note. (7) rights upon issuance of other securities. ---------------------------------------- (a) adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of common stock. if ------------------------------------------------------------- and whenever on or after the issuance date, the company issues or sells, or in accordance with this section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of common stock owned or held by or for the account of the company, but excluding shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold by the company in connection with any excluded security) for a consideration per share less than a price (the "applicable price") equal to the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale (the foregoing a "dilutive issuance"), then immediately upon such dilutive issuance, the conversion price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to - 13 - the lowest price per share at which any share of common stock were issued or sold or deemed to be issued or sold (in accordance with this section 7(a)) in connection with such dilutive issuance; provided, however, that if the company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock in a dilutive issuance that is a permitted financing, then immediately after such dilutive issuance, the conversion price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (a) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance and (b) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of (i) the product derived by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance and the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such dilutive issuance plus (ii) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon such dilutive issuance, by (2) the product derived by multiplying (i) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such dilutive issuance by (ii) the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately after such dilutive issuance. for purposes of determining the adjusted conversion price under this section 7(a), the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of options. if the company in any manner grants or ------------------- sells any options and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of such option is less than the conversion price, immediately prior thereto, then each such share of common stock underlying such option shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the granting or sale of such option for such price per share. for purposes of this section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of such option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to any one share of common stock upon granting or sale of the option, upon exercise of the option and upon conversion or exchange or exercise of any convertible security issuable upon exercise of such option. no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of common stock or of such convertible securities upon the exercise of such options or upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible securities. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any ------------------------------------ manner issues or sells any convertible securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise thereof is less than the conversion price, immediately prior thereto, then each such share of common stock underlying such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities for such price per share. for the purposes of this section 7(a)(ii), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to any one share of common stock upon the issuance or sale of the convertible security and upon the conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible security. - 14 - no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of common stock upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such convertible securities, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustment of the conversion price had been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 7(a), no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (iii) change in option price or rate of conversion. if the ------------------------------------------------- purchase price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exchange or exercise of any convertible securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock changes at any time, the conversion price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the conversion price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. for purposes of this section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any option or convertible security that was outstanding as of the issuance date are changed in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such option or convertible security and the common stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such change. no adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the conversion price then in effect. (iv) calculation of consideration received. in case any option is ------------------------------------- issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such options by the parties thereto, the options will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company will be the closing sale price of such securities on the date of receipt. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the company and the required holders. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the "valuation event"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within fourteen (14) business days after the tenth (10th) day following the valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the company and the required holders. the determination of such appraiser shall be deemed binding - 15 - upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. (v) record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of ----------- common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or in convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. (b) adjustment of conversion price upon subdivision or combination of ------------------------------------------------------------------ common stock. if the company at any time on or after the issuance date ------------- subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. if the company at any time on or after the issuance date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. (c) other events. if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the ------------ provisions of this section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights, other rights with equity features or any distribution or dividend of securities on the preferred stock of the company existing on the date hereof), then the company's board of directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the conversion price so as to protect the rights of the holder under this note; provided that no such adjustment will increase the conversion price as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 7. the company shall within one (1) business day notify each of the holders of any of the notes of any change to the conversion price and describe in reasonable detail the basis for such change. (8) holder's right of optional redemption. from time to time on and after -------------------------------------- the eighth (8th) anniversary of the issuance date, the holder shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that the company redeem (each, a "holder optional redemption") up to all of the then applicable conversion amount of this note (the "available holder optional redemption amount") by delivering written notice thereof (a "holder optional redemption notice") to the company. the holder optional redemption notice shall indicate the conversion amount of the available holder optional redemption amount the holder is electing to have redeemed (the "holder optional redemption amount"). the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 8 shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to 107% of the holder optional redemption amount (the "holder optional redemption price"). redemptions required by this section 8 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8, but subject to section 3(d), until the holder receives the holder optional redemption price, the holder optional redemption amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holder into - 16 - common stock pursuant to section 3, and any such conversion shall reduce the holder optional redemption amount in the manner set forth by the holder in the applicable conversion notice. (9) optional redemptions at the company's election. ---------------------------------------------- (a) general. at any time from and after the eighth (8th) anniversary ------- of the issuance date, so long as there has been no equity conditions failure, the company shall have the right, to redeem all or any portion of the conversion amount then remaining under this note (the "optional redemption amount") as designated in the optional redemption notice, as of the optional redemption date (an "optional redemption"). the portion of this note subject to redemption pursuant to this section 9(a) shall be redeemed by the company in cash at a price equal to the 107% of the conversion amount being redeemed (the "optional redemption price"). the company may exercise its right to require redemption under this section 9 by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the holders of notes (the "optional redemption notice" and the date all of the holders received such notice is referred to as the "optional redemption notice date") and each optional redemption notice shall be irrevocable. the optional redemption notice shall state (1) the date on which the optional redemption shall occur (the "optional redemption date") which date shall be not less than five (5) trading days nor more than thirty (30) trading days after the optional redemption notice date, and (2) the aggregate conversion amount of the notes which the company has elected to be subject to optional redemption from all of the holders of the notes pursuant to this section 9(a) (and analogous provisions under the other notes) on the optional redemption date. the company may not effect more than one (1) optional redemption. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 9(a), until the optional redemption price is paid, in full, the optional redemption amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by the holders into shares of common stock pursuant to section 3. all conversion amounts converted by the holder into such common stock after the optional redemption notice date shall reduce the optional redemption amount of this note required to be redeemed on the optional redemption date. redemptions made pursuant to this section 9 shall be made in accordance with section 12. (b) pro rata redemption requirement. if the company elects to cause an ------------------------------- optional redemption with respect to this note pursuant to section 9(a), then it must simultaneously take the same action with respect to the other notes and make simultaneous payments of the applicable amounts to be paid to each holder of the other notes. if the company elects to cause an optional redemption pursuant to section 9(a) (or similar provisions under the other notes) with respect to less than all of the conversion amounts of the notes then outstanding, then the company shall require a proportionate redemption of a conversion amount from each of the holders of the notes equal to the product of (i) the aggregate conversion amount of all the notes which the company has elected to cause to be redeemed pursuant to section 9(a), multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion amount of the applicable note on the optional redemption date and the denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate conversion amounts of all notes on the optional redemption date (such fraction with respect to each holder is referred to as its "redemption allocation percentage", and such amount with respect to each holder is referred to as its "pro rata redemption amount"), in the event that a holder of any notes shall sell - 17 - or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's redemption allocation percentage and pro rata redemption amount. (10) noncircumvention. the company hereby covenants and agrees that the ---------------- company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the holder of this note. (11) reservation of authorized shares. -------------------------------- (a) reservation. commencing on the issuance date and until the ----------- authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, the company shall reserve in respect of the conversion of the notes not less than 100,000,000 shares of common stock. immediately on and after the authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, the company shall reserve out of its authorized and unissued common stock a number of shares of common stock for each of the notes equal to 130% of the conversion rate with respect to the conversion amount of each of the notes as of the issuance date and, for so long thereafter as any of the notes are outstanding, the company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the notes, 130% of the number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of shares of common stock so reserved be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the "required reserve amount"). the initial number of shares of common stock reserved for conversions of the notes and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the notes based on the principal amount (including capitalized interest) of the notes held by each holder at the issuance date or on the date of any increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the "authorized share allocation"). in the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder's notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holder's authorized share allocation. any shares of common stock reserved and allocated to any person which ceases to hold a prencen note or watershed note, respectively, shall be re-allocated to the remaining holders of each prencen note or watershed note, respectively, pro rata based on the principal amount (including capitalized interest) of such notes then held by such holders. (b) insufficient authorized shares. if at any time after the --------------------------------- authorized share stockholder approval date or the authorized share stockholder consent effective date, as the case may be, while any of the notes remain outstanding the company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and reserved shares of common stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the notes at least a number of shares of common stock equal to the required reserve amount (an "authorized share failure"), then the company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the company's authorized - 18 - shares of common stock to an amount sufficient to allow the company to reserve the required reserve amount for the notes then outstanding. without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (12) redemptions. ----------- (a) mechanics. subject to section 12(b), the company shall deliver the --------- applicable event of default redemption price to the holder within seven (7) business days after the event of default redemption trigger date. subject to section 12(b), if the holder has submitted a change of control redemption notice in accordance with section 5(b), the company shall deliver the applicable change of control redemption price to the holder concurrently with the consummation of such change of control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such change of control and within five (5) business days after the company's receipt of such notice otherwise. subject to section 12(b), the company shall deliver the holder optional redemption price to the holder within five (5) business days after the company's receipt of the holder optional redemption notice. the company shall deliver the optional redemption price to the holder on the applicable optional redemption date. subject to pro rata redemption requirement in section 25(c), in the event of a redemption of less than all of the conversion amount of this note, the company shall (at the holder's request) promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the holder a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) representing the outstanding principal which has not been redeemed. in the event that the company does not pay the applicable redemption price to the holder within the time period required, at any time thereafter and until the company pays such unpaid redemption price in full, the holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the company to promptly return to the holder all or any portion of this note representing the conversion amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable redemption price (together with any late charges thereon) has not been paid. upon the company's receipt of such notice, (x) the redemption notice shall be null and void with respect to such conversion amount, (y) the company shall, at the holder's request, immediately return this note, or issue a new note (in accordance with section 19(d)) to the holder representing such conversion amount and (z) the conversion price of this note or such new notes and all of the other outstanding notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (a) the conversion price as in effect on the date on which the redemption notice is voided and (b) the lowest closing bid price during the period beginning on and including the date on which the redemption notice is delivered to the company and ending on and including the date on which the redemption notice is voided. the holder's delivery of a notice voiding a redemption notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the company's obligations to capitalize late charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the conversion amount subject to such notice. - 19 - (b) redemption by other holders. notwithstanding anything else ------------------------------ contained herein, upon the company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in section 4(b), section 5(b) or section 8 (each, an "other redemption notice"), the company shall immediately, but no later than one (1) business day of its receipt thereof), forward to the holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. if the company receives a redemption notice and one or more other redemption notices, during the fifteen (15) business day period beginning on and including the date which is seven (7) business days prior to the company's receipt of the holder's redemption notice and ending on and including the date which is seven (7) business days after the company's receipt of the holder's redemption notice and the company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such redemption notice(s) and such other redemption notices received during such fifteen (15) business day period (the last day of such fifteen-day period, the "consolidation date"), then the company shall redeem on the consolidation date a pro rata amount from each holder of the notes (including the holder) based on the applicable conversion amounts of the notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such redemption notice(s) and such other redemption notices received by the company during such fifteen (15) business day period, provided, however, such pro rata payment shall not cure any default or event of default occurring hereunder resulting from such failure to fully pay the amount otherwise due on this note. (13) security. the obligations are secured to the extent and in the manner -------- set forth in the security documents. (14) voting rights. the holder shall have no voting rights as the holder of ------------- this note, except as required by law, including but not limited to the delaware general corporation law, and as expressly provided in this note.

("wcp"), watershed capital institutional partners, l.p. ("wci") and any affiliates of wcp, collectively, the "watershed funds"), which consent may be withheld by any such watershed fund in its sole and absolute discretion: (i) enter into or make payments under any consulting, management agreement and/or similar agreement or arrangement with the prencen group and/or any of its affiliates; - 21 - (ii) enter into any subsequent placement with the prencen group and/or any of its affiliates; provided, however, that no such consent shall be required if (1) such subsequent placement is on commercially reasonable terms and on an arm's-length basis, (2) such subsequent placement is approved by a majority of the non-interested members of the board of directors of the company meeting in a separate session and (3) the holders of the notes have the right to participate in such subsequent placement pursuant to section 4(o) of the securities purchase agreements; (iii) enter into any debt financing agreement or other financing arrangement (other than a subsequent placement) with the prencen group and/or any of its affiliates; or (iv) except as provided in the foregoing clause (ii), enter into any transaction with any affiliate of the company and/or the prencen group, other than for (a) ordinary course executive and employee compensation arrangements, including, without limitation, salary, equity compensation and bonuses, for directors, officers and employees of the company approved by the compensation committee of the company's board of directors, (b) the exchange contemplated in section 3(e) hereof, (c) any transaction or transactions providing for payments which do not and cannot, in the aggregate, exceed $250,000 per annum and (d) the performance of the company's obligations pursuant to the securities purchase agreements, the registration rights agreement, the series b certificate of designations and the series b-1 certificate of designations (each as defined in the prencen securities purchase agreement) for the preferred shares, the warrants and the notes; provided, however, that for the purposes of the foregoing clauses (a) and (c), such transactions must be on arm's-length terms and approved by a majority of the non-interested directors of the board of directors of the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent of any watershed fund shall be required pursuant to this section 15(h) unless (x) on the applicable date of determination, the watershed funds own in the aggregate at least 50% of the original principal amount (without regard for any capitalized interest added to such principal amount as of such date of determination) of the watershed notes; provided, however, that if any portion of the original principal amount of the watershed notes are exchanged, pursuant to section 3(e), for new securities, the principal amount of such notes exchanged for any such new securities received by the watershed funds on such date of determination in exchange for such original principal amount of the watershed notes shall be taken into account in determining whether the watershed funds meet the foregoing ownership threshold or (y) the watershed facility has not been repaid in full.
