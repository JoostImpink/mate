(a) unless f&m bancorp shall have breached in any material respect any covenant or representation contained in the plan and such breach has not been cured, f&m bancorp may exercise the option, in whole or part, at any time or from time to time if a purchase event (as defined below) shall have occurred and be continuing; provided that to the extent the option shall not have been exercised, it shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the effective date of the merger, or (ii) the termination of the plan in accordance with the provisions thereof prior to the - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cusip no.: 436919104 page 53 of 62 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- occurrence of a purchase event (other than as a result of a willful breach by home corporation of any specified covenant or as a result of failure of home corporation's stockholders to approve the plan by the vote required under applicable law or under home corporation's charter), or (iii) 12 months after termination of the plan due to a willful breach by home corporation of any specified covenant or failure of home corporation's stockholders to approve the plan by the vote required under applicable law or under home corporation's charter; provided, however, that any purchase of shares upon exercise of the option shall be subject to compliance with applicable law, including, without limitation, the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended. any exercise of the option shall be subject to compliance with applicable provisions of law. (b) as used herein, a "purchase event" shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof: (i) home corporation or home federal savings bank ("home bank"), without having received f&m bancorp's prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement with any person (x) to merge or consolidate, or enter into any similar transaction, except as contemplated in the plan, (y) to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the assets of home corporation or home bank, or (z) to purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of home corporation or home bank; (ii) any person (other than home corporation or home bank in a fiduciary capacity, or f&m bancorp or farmers and mechanics national bank in a fiduciary capacity) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of home corporation common stock after the date hereof (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this option agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") and the regulations promulgated thereunder); (iii) any person shall have made a bona fide proposal to home corporation by public announcement or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure to acquire home corporation or home bank by merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar transaction, and following such bona fide proposal the stockholders of home corporation vote not to adopt the plan; or (iv) home corporation shall have willfully breached any specified covenant following a bona fide proposal to home corporation or home bank to acquire home corporation or home bank by merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar transaction, which breach would entitle f&m bancorp to terminate the plan (without regard to the cure periods - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cusip no.: 436919104 page 54 of 62 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- provided for therein) and such breach shall not have been cured prior to the notice date (as defined below). if more than one of the transactions giving rise to a purchase event under this section 3(b) is undertaken or effected, then all such transactions shall give rise only to one purchase event, which purchase event shall be deemed continuing for all purposes hereunder until all such transactions are abandoned. as used in this option agreement, "person" shall have the meanings specified in sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the exchange act. (c) in the event f&m bancorp wishes to exercise the option, it shall send to home corporation a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise, and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days after the notice date for the closing of such purchase ("closing date"); provided that if prior notification to or approval of any federal or state regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, f&m bancorp shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification period has expired or been terminated or such approval has been obtained and any requisite waiting period shall have passed.
