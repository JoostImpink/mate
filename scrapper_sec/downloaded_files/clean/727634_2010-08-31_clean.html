the securities to be included in any such registration pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among the requesting holders based upon the number of shares of registrable stock then held by such holders. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the company may withdraw any registration statement referred to in this section 3 without thereby incurring any liability to the holders of registrable stock. 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
