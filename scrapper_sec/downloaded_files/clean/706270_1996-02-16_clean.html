(k) if the company uses rule 434 of the 1933 act regulations, it will comply with the requirements of rule 434 of such regulations and the prospectus will not be "materially different," as such term is used in rule 434 of the 1933 act regulations, from the prospectus first given to the underwriters for their use. section 4. payment of expenses. the company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this agreement, including (i) the printing and filing of any post-effective amendment to the registration statement required in connection with the sale of the securities, (ii) the prepara- tion, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the securi- ties to the underwriters, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the company's counsel and accountants, (iv) the qualification of the securities under securities laws in accordance with the provi- sions of section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of the blue sky survey and any legal investment survey, (v) the printing and delivery to the underwriters of copies of the registration statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, of each preliminary prospectus supplement, and of the prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, (vii) the printing and delivery to the underwriters of copies of the blue sky survey and any legal investment survey, (viii) the fees and expenses of continuing the listing of the common stock on the new york stock exchange and (ix) the fee of the national association of securi- ties dealers, inc. if this agreement is terminated by the representatives in accordance with the provisions of section 5 or section 9(a)(i) hereof, the company shall reimburse the underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the underwriters unless such termi- nation occurs by reason of the failure to satisfy the conditions contained in section 5(b)(ii), 5(g) insofar it relates to deliv- eries by the selling stockholders and 5(h)(iii) in which case such fees and expenses shall be paid by the selling stockholder or stockholders as to which such failure of condition relates. section 5. conditions of underwriters' obligations. the obligations of the underwriters hereunder are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the company and the selling stockholders herein contained, to the performance by the company and the selling stockholders of their obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: (a) the registration statement, as amended, shall have become effective on or prior to the date of this agreement. at the closing time, no stop order suspending the effec- tiveness of the registration statement shall have been issued under the 1933 act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the commission. the price of the securi- ties and any price-related information previously omitted from the effective registration statement and any term sheet used pursuant to rule 434 of the 1933 act regulations shall have been transmitted to the commission for filing pursuant to rule 424(b) of the 1933 act regulations within the pre- scribed time period and prior to the closing time the compa- ny shall have provided evidence satisfactory to the repre- sentatives of such timely filing, or a post-effective amend- ment providing such information shall have been promptly filed and declared effective.

company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or impo- sition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the company pursuant to any applicable contract (for the purposes of said opinion an applicable contract is a contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease

believe that the registration state- ment, as amended, (except for financial statements and other financial and statistical data included therein), at the time it became effective, con- tained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the prospectus (except for the financial statements and other financial and statistical data contained therein), at the representation date (unless the term "pro- spectus" refers to a prospectus which has been provided to the

(a) the repre- sentatives may terminate this agreement, by notice to the company and each selling stockholder, at any time at or prior to the closing time (i) if there has been, since the date of this agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the registration statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the united states or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the representatives, impracticable to market the securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the securi- ties, or (iii) if trading in the common stock or the warrants has been suspended by the commission, or if trading generally on either the american stock exchange or the new york stock exchange has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the commis- sion or any other governmental authority, or if a banking morato- rium has been declared by either federal, new york or arizona authorities.

other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the defaulted securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number of defaulted securities does not exceed 10% of the securities, each of the non-defaulting underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting under- writers, or (b) if the number of defaulted securities exceeds 10% of the securities, this agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting underwriter. no action taken pursuant to this section shall relieve any defaulting underwriter from liability in respect of its default. in the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this agreement, any of the representatives, the selling stockholders (acting unanimously) or the company shall have the right to postpone the closing time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the registration statement or prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. section 11. notices. all notices and other communica- tions
