$9.475 billion, plus related fees and expenses. the reporting persons expect to fund these payments using cash on hand. the information set forth or incorporated by reference in item 4 is incorporated by reference in this item 3. item 4. purpose of transaction as described in item 3 above, this statement is being filed in connection with the merger agreement and the tender agreements. on july 28, 2016, oracle, the issuer, oc and merger subsidiary entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147;merger agreement&#148;) pursuant to which oc has agreed to cause merger subsidiary to commence a cash tender offer (the &#147;offer&#148;) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares at a price per share equal to $109.00 (the &#147;offer price&#148;), net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. the obligation of oc and merger subsidiary to consummate the offer is subject to the condition that, immediately prior to the expiration of the offer, (i) there be validly tendered and not withdrawn the number of shares that, when added to the shares then owned by oracle, oc and merger subsidiary, would represent no less than a majority of (a) all shares then issued and outstanding and (b) all shares that the issuer may be required to issue upon the conversion, exercise or exchange, as applicable, of any then outstanding stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or performance share units (collectively, &#147;company compensatory awards&#148;) and any other options, warrants or other rights to acquire, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares that, in each case, are outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer, and are vested or otherwise exercisable, convertible or exchangeable at or immediately prior to the expiration of the offer, and (ii) there be validly tendered and not withdrawn the number of shares (excluding, in such number, shares beneficially owned by (1) netsuite restricted holdings llc, lawrence j. ellison, david ellison and margaret ellison and their respective affiliates who beneficially own shares (the &#147;lje parties&#148;), (2) oracle or its affiliates or (3) any executive officer or directors of the issuer or their affiliates) that represents a majority of the shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer (excluding, from such issued and outstanding shares, shares beneficially owned by (x) the lje parties, (y) oracle or its affiliates or (z) any executive officers or directors of the issuer or their affiliates). the consummation of the offer is also conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or termination of the applicable premerger waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 and other customary conditions. as soon as practicable following the consummation of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions set forth in the merger agreement, merger subsidiary will merge with and into the issuer, the separate corporate existence of merger subsidiary shall cease and the issuer shall be the successor or surviving corporation of the merger (the &#147;merger&#148;), and a subsidiary of oc. the merger will be governed by section 251(h) of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, with no stockholder vote required to consummate the merger. upon the consummation of the merger (the &#147;effective time&#148;), each share will be converted into the right to receive the offer price, without interest. the unvested portion of each company compensatory award that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the effective time and held by an employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries will be assumed by oracle and converted automatically into a corresponding option, share of restricted stock, restricted stock unit, performance share or performance share unit as the case may be, denominated in shares of oracle common stock, the number and terms of which will be determined pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. the vested portion (including any portion that pursuant to its terms becomes vested solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) of each company compensatory award that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished, and the former holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as determined pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. any performance metrics relating to any performance shares or performance share units of the issuer (each, a &#147;company performance award&#148;) that, immediately prior to the effective time, remain subject to the achievement of such performance metrics either shall be (i) deemed achieved at target levels as of immediately prior to the effective time or (ii) with respect to company performance awards granted in april 2016, treated in accordance with the applicable award agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, the unvested portion of each company compensatory award that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the effective time and held by a person who is not an employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries will not be assumed by oracle and will be cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. as an inducement to enter into the merger agreement, and in consideration thereof, oc and merger subsidiary entered into a tender and support agreement with each of zachary nelson, evan goldberg, james mcgeever, ronald gill and netsuite restricted holdings llc, an entity controlled by lawrence j. ellison (each a &#147;stockholder&#148;), each dated as of the date of the merger agreement (the &#147;tender agreements&#148;). pursuant to the tender agreements, each stockholder has agreed to tender, and not withdraw, all shares beneficially owned by them as of the date of the tender agreement or acquired by them after such date (collectively, the &#147;subject shares&#148;) no later than three (3) business days after the commencement of the offer. none of the reporting persons paid any consideration to the stockholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the tender agreement. the stockholders have also agreed that they will vote their subject shares against certain alternative corporate transactions, each as more fully described in the tender agreements, until the earliest to occur of (i) the date the merger agreement is validly terminated, (ii) the effectiveness of the merger, or (iii) except with respect to netsuite restricted holdings llc, the date upon which any amendment of or modification to the merger agreement or the offer is made that (a) changes the form of consideration to be delivered by merger subsidiary pursuant to the offer or (b) decreases the offer price (the &#147;support period&#148;). in addition, netsuite restricted holdings llc has agreed that, in the event that the issuer&#146;s board of directors terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal from a third party, it will support such superior proposal if the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares not owned by the executive officers or directors of the issuer or their affiliates, the ultimate parent entity of any purchaser party to any superior proposal or its affiliates, or the lje parties support such superior proposal. in furtherance of the stockholders&#146; covenants under the tender agreements, the stockholders agreed to appoint oc as their attorney-in-fact and proxy vote the stockholders&#146; subject shares against the corporate transactions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. shared voting power with respect to the shares owned by the stockholders may be deemed to have been acquired through execution of the tender agreements. the reporting persons have not expended any funds in connection with the execution of the tender agreements. schedule b attached hereto contains the names and number of shares beneficially held by each stockholder (as represented to oracle by the issuer and the stockholders). the purpose of the offer is to acquire control of, and ultimately following the merger, the entire equity interest in, the issuer while allowing the issuer&#146;s stockholders an opportunity to receive the offer price promptly by tendering their shares of common stock into the offer. after the consummation of the offer, oc and merger subsidiary intend to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. at the effective time of the merger, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the issuer will be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in an exhibit to the merger agreement, (ii) the bylaws of merger subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be the bylaws of the issuer and (iii) the directors and officers of merger subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the initial directors and officers of the issuer. following the merger, the shares will no longer be traded on the new york stock exchange, there will be no public market for the shares, and registration of the shares under the exchange act will be terminated. except as set forth in this statement and in connection with the merger described above, the reporting persons do not have any plan or proposals that relate to or would result

file with the sec upon commencement of the offer. at the time the offer is commenced, oracle, oc and merger subsidiary will file tender offer materials on schedule to, and the issuer will file a solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 with the sec with respect to the offer. the tender offer materials (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will contain important information. holders of shares are urged to read these documents when they become available because they will contain important information that holders of issuer securities should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities. the offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents, as well as the solicitation/recommendation statement, will be made available to all holders of shares at no expense to them. the tender offer materials and the solicitation/recommendation statement will be made available for free at the sec&#146;s web site at www.sec.gov. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b) other than

35,291,459 shares. all shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the reporting persons constitute approximately 43.4% of the issued and outstanding shares as of july 28, 2016 (as

otherwise expressly provided in the tender agreements. the reporting persons are not entitled to any rights as stockholders of the issuer as to the shares held by an independent director of oracle through family trusts. this schedule 13d shall not be construed as an admission by the reporting persons that the reporting persons are, for the purposes of section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, the beneficial owners of any shares of issuer common stock covered by the tender agreements or held by the independent director of oracle through family trusts. except as set forth in
