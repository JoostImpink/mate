insolvency exchange right plus; (ii) an additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all dividends declared and unpaid on each such exchangeable share and all dividends declared on patch shares which have not been declared on such exchangeable shares in accordance with article 3 of the exchangeable share provisions (provided that if the record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the day of closing of such purchase and sale the purchase price shall not include such additional amount equivalent to such declared and unpaid dividends). in connection with each exercise of the insolvency exchange right, patch will provide to the trustee, as trustee for and on behalf of the shareholders, an officer's certificate setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each exchangeable share. the purchase price for each such exchangeable share so purchased may be satisfied by patch issuing and delivering to the trustee for delivery by the trustee to the

patch of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by section 4.7 of this agreement. if only a part of the exchangeable shares represented by any certificate or certificates delivered to the trustee are to be purchased by patch under the insolvency exchange right, a new certificate for the balance of such exchangeable shares shall be issued to the shareholder at the expense of exchangeco. 4.5 delivery of patch shares; effect of exercise promptly, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the certificates representing the exchangeable shares which the shareholder desires patch to purchase under the insolvency exchange right, together with such documents and instruments of transfer and a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the insolvency exchange right (and payment of taxes as contemplated by section 4.7 of this agreement, if any, or evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to patch, trustee shall notify patch and exchangeco of its receipt of the same, which notice to patch and exchangeco shall constitute exercise of the insolvency exchange right by the trustee on behalf of the holder of such exchangeable shares, and patch shall immediately thereafter upon receipt of such notice deliver or cause to be delivered to the shareholder of such exchangeable shares (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such shareholder), certificates representing the number of patch shares deliverable in connection with the exercise of the insolvency exchange right, which shares shall be, or shall have been, duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance, and cheques for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefor. patch shall, immediately upon receipt of such certificates representing the exchangeable shares from the shareholder, deliver the certificates to the registered office of exchangeco for cancellation. immediately upon the giving of notice by the trustee to patch and exchangeco of the exercise of the insolvency exchange right, as provided in this section 4.5, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the insolvency exchange right shall be deemed to have occurred, and the holder of such exchangeable shares shall be deemed to have transferred to patch its right, title and interest in and to such exchangeable shares and the related interest in the trust estate and shall cease to be a holder of such exchangeable shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a shareholder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive the purchase price therefor, unless the requisite number of patch shares (together with a cheque for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefor) is not issued and delivered by patch to the trustee and delivered by the trustee to such shareholder (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such shareholder), within five (5) business days of the date of the giving of such notice by the trustee, in which case the rights of the shareholder shall remain unaffected until such patch shares are so issued and delivered by patch, as the case may be, and any such cheque is so delivered and honoured. concurrently with such shareholder ceasing to be a shareholder of exchangeable shares, the shareholder shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of patch shares delivered to it pursuant to the insolvency exchange right. 4.6 exercise of insolvency exchange right subsequent to retraction in the event

"retracted shares") and is notified by exchangeco pursuant to section 6.6 of the exchangeable share provisions that exchangeco will not be permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all such retracted shares, and provided that patch shall not have exercised the retraction call right with respect to the retracted shares and that the shareholder has not revoked the retraction request delivered by the shareholder to exchangeco pursuant to section 6.1 of the exchangeable share provisions, the retraction request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the shareholder to the trustee instructing the trustee to exercise the insolvency exchange right with respect to those retracted shares which exchangeco is unable to redeem. in any such event, exchangeco hereby agrees with the trustee and in favour of the shareholder promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the trustee all relevant materials delivered by the shareholder to exchangeco (including without limitation a copy of the retraction request delivered pursuant to section 6.1 of the exchangeable share provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the retracted shares and the trustee will thereupon exercise the insolvency exchange right with respect to the retracted shares that exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require patch to purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions of this article 4. 4.7 stamp or other transfer taxes upon any sale of exchangeable shares to patch pursuant to the insolvency exchange right or the automatic exchange rights, the share certificate or certificates representing patch shares to be delivered in connection with the payment of the total purchase price therefor shall be issued in

shall pay (and none of patch, exchangeco nor the trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer or other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of such shares to a person other than such shareholder; or (ii) shall have established to the satisfaction of the trustee, patch and exchangeco that such taxes, if any, have

having been paid to the shareholder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. to the extent that the amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a shareholder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the

any shareholder all or any part of the exchangeable shares held by the shareholder and the automatic exchange rights all in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. patch hereby acknowledges receipt from the trustee, as trustee for and on behalf of the shareholders, of good and valuable consideration (and the adequacy thereof) for the grant of the insolvency exchange right, and the automatic exchange rights, by patch to the trustee. during the term of the trust and subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the trustee shall possess and be vested with full legal ownership of the insolvency exchange right and the automatic exchange rights and shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights and powers of an owner with respect to the insolvency exchange right and the automatic exchange rights, provided that the trustee shall: (a) hold the insolvency exchange right and the automatic exchange rights and the legal title thereto as trustee solely for the use and benefit of the shareholders in accordance with the provisions of this agreement; and (b) except as specifically authorized by this agreement, have no power or authority to exercise or otherwise

created pursuant to this agreement, and shall not assign or transfer such rights except to a successor trustee hereunder. the insolvency exchange right and the automatic exchange rights shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by the trustee. subject to section 7.14, the trustee shall exercise the insolvency exchange right only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to this article 4 from shareholders entitled to instruct the trustee as to the exercise thereof. to the extent that no instructions are received from a shareholder with respect to the insolvency exchange right, the trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise of the insolvency exchange right. 4.2 legended share certificates exchangeco will cause each certificate representing exchangeable shares to bear an appropriate legend notifying the shareholders of: (a) their right to instruct the trustee with respect to the exercise of the insolvency exchange right in respect of the exchangeable shares held by a shareholder; and (b) the automatic exchange rights. 4.3 purchase price the purchase price payable by patch for each exchangeable share to be purchased by patch under the insolvency exchange right shall be an amount per share equal to: (i) the current market price of a patch share on the last business day prior to the day of closing of the purchase and sale of such exchangeable share under the insolvency exchange right plus; (ii) an additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all dividends declared and unpaid on each such exchangeable share and all dividends declared on patch shares which have not been declared on such exchangeable shares in accordance with article 3 of the exchangeable share provisions (provided that if the record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the day of closing of such purchase and sale the purchase price shall not include such additional amount equivalent to such declared and unpaid dividends). in connection with each exercise of the insolvency exchange right, patch will provide to the trustee, as trustee for and on behalf of the shareholders, an officer's certificate setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each exchangeable share. the purchase price for each such exchangeable share so purchased may be satisfied by patch issuing and delivering to the trustee for delivery by the trustee to the shareholders, one patch share and a cheque for the balance, if any, of the purchase price without interest. 4.4 exercise instructions subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a shareholder shall be entitled, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an insolvency event, to instruct the trustee to exercise the insolvency exchange right with respect to all or any part of the exchangeable shares registered in the name of such shareholder on the books of exchangeco. to cause the exercise of the insolvency exchange right by the trustee, the shareholder shall deliver to the trustee, in person or by certified or registered mail the certificates representing the exchangeable shares which such shareholder desires patch to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of exchangeable shares under the laws applicable to exchangeco and the articles and by-laws of exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the trustee may reasonably require together with: (a) a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the insolvency exchange right, contained on the reverse of or attached to the exchangeable share certificates, stating: (i) that the shareholder thereby instructs the trustee to exercise the insolvency exchange right so as to require patch to purchase from the shareholder the number of exchangeable shares specified therein; (ii) that such shareholder has good title to and owns all such exchangeable shares to be acquired by patch free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances; (iii) the name in which the certificates representing patch shares to be issued in connection with the exercise of the insolvency exchange

patch of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by section 4.7 of this agreement. if only a part of the exchangeable shares represented by any certificate or certificates delivered to the trustee are to be purchased by patch under the insolvency exchange right, a new certificate for the balance of such exchangeable shares shall be issued to the shareholder at the expense of exchangeco. 4.5 delivery of patch shares; effect of exercise promptly, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the certificates representing the exchangeable shares which the shareholder desires patch to purchase under the insolvency exchange right, together with such documents and instruments of transfer and a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the insolvency exchange right (and payment of taxes as contemplated by section 4.7 of this agreement, if any, or evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to patch, trustee shall notify patch and exchangeco of its receipt of the same, which notice to patch and exchangeco shall constitute exercise of the insolvency exchange right by the trustee on behalf of the holder of such exchangeable shares, and patch shall immediately thereafter upon receipt of such notice deliver or cause to be delivered to the shareholder of such exchangeable shares (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such shareholder), certificates representing the number of patch shares deliverable in connection with the exercise of the insolvency exchange right, which shares shall be, or shall have been, duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance, and cheques for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefor. patch shall, immediately upon receipt of such certificates representing the exchangeable shares from the shareholder, deliver the certificates to the registered office of exchangeco for cancellation. immediately upon the giving of notice by the trustee to patch and exchangeco of the exercise of the insolvency exchange right, as provided in this section 4.5, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the insolvency exchange right shall be deemed to have occurred, and the holder of such exchangeable shares shall be deemed to have transferred to patch its right, title and interest in and to such exchangeable shares and the related interest in the trust estate and shall cease to be a holder of such exchangeable shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a shareholder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive the purchase price therefore, unless the requisite number of patch shares (together with a cheque for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefore) is not issued and delivered by patch to the trustee and delivered by the trustee to such shareholder (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such shareholder), within five (5) business days of the date of the giving of such notice by the trustee, in which case the rights of the shareholder shall remain unaffected until such patch shares are so issued and delivered by patch, as the case may be, and any such cheque is so delivered and honoured. concurrently with such shareholder ceasing to be a shareholder of exchangeable shares, the shareholder shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of patch shares delivered to it pursuant to the insolvency exchange right. 4.6 exercise of insolvency exchange right subsequent to retraction in the event that a shareholder has exercised its right under article 6 of the exchangeable share provisions to require exchangeco to redeem any or all of the exchangeable shares held by the shareholder (the "retracted shares") and is notified by exchangeco pursuant to section 6.6 of the exchangeable share provisions that exchangeco will not be permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all such retracted shares, and provided that patch shall not have exercised the retraction call right with respect to the retracted shares and that the shareholder has not revoked the retraction request delivered by the shareholder to exchangeco pursuant to section 6.1 of the exchangeable share provisions, the retraction request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the shareholder to the trustee instructing the trustee to exercise the insolvency exchange right with respect to those retracted shares which exchangeco is unable to redeem. in any such event, exchangeco hereby agrees with the trustee and in favour of the shareholder promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the trustee all relevant materials delivered by the shareholder to exchangeco (including without limitation a copy of the retraction request delivered pursuant to section 6.1 of the exchangeable share provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the retracted shares and the trustee will thereupon exercise the insolvency exchange right with respect to the retracted shares that exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require patch to purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions of this article 4. 4.7 stamp or other transfer taxes upon any sale of exchangeable shares to patch pursuant to the insolvency exchange right or the automatic exchange rights, the share certificate or certificates representing patch shares to be delivered in connection with the payment of the total purchase price therefore shall be issued in the name of, or transferred to, the shareholder of the exchangeable shares so sold without charge to the shareholder of the exchangeable shares so sold; provided, however that such shareholder: (i) shall pay (and none of patch, exchangeco nor the trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer or other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of such shares to a person other than such shareholder; or (ii) shall have established to the satisfaction of the trustee, patch and exchangeco that such taxes, if any, have been paid. 4.8 notice of insolvency event immediately upon the occurrence of an insolvency event or any event which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be an insolvency

exchangeable shares outstanding from time to time; and (b) as are now and may hereafter be required to enable and permit exchangeco and patch to meet their respective obligations hereunder, under the support agreement, under the exchangeable share provisions and under any other security or commitment pursuant to which patch may now or hereafter be required to issue patch shares. 4.11 automatic exchange on liquidation of patch (a) patch will give the trustee and the shareholders notice of each of the following events (each a "liquidation event") at the time set forth below: (i) in the event of any determination by the board of directors of patch to institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings with respect to patch or to effect any other distribution of assets of patch among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other

having been paid to the shareholder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. to the extent that the amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a shareholder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the
