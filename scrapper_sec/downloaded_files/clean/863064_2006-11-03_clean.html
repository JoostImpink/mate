tinto and its affiliates at that time (disregarding any unissued ivanhoe shares underlying any unexercised series a warrants or series b warrants). where such calculation results in the proportionate number of directors not being a whole number, such proportionate number of directors shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number where such calculation ends with a figure .5 or greater and shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number where such calculation ends with a figure less than .5. at all times, rio tinto shall be entitled to back to contents 23 nominate as one of its rio tinto

rio tinto representatives among ivanhoe&#146;s management nominees for election to the board of directors at each meeting of the shareholders of ivanhoe at which directors are to be elected. if, at any time, rio tinto ceases to be entitled to nominate a number of rio tinto representatives equal to the number of incumbent rio tinto representatives, rio tinto will promptly procure the resignation

transaction) (&#147;dilutive ivanhoe shares&#148;), ivanhoe will offer, by anti-dilution offer notice, and rio tinto will have the right, exercisable in accordance with the terms of this part 5, to purchase a number of additional ivanhoe shares (the &#147;anti-dilution ivanhoe shares&#148;) that would result in rio tinto and its affiliates beneficially owning, after the issuance of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares to rio tinto and the dilutive ivanhoe shares to each of the other persons to whom ivanhoe issues such dilutive ivanhoe shares, the same percentage of issued and outstanding ivanhoe shares that rio tinto and its affiliates beneficially owned immediately before the issuance of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares and the dilutive ivanhoe shares. quarterly anti-dilution offer notices 5.2 if, at any time and from time to time, an issuance of dilutive ivanhoe shares is not a special dilutive issuance (an &#147;ordinary dilutive issuance&#148;), ivanhoe will give notice to rio tinto (a &#147;quarterly anti-dilution offer notice&#148;) not later than the earlier of: 	 (a) 	 the last day of the calendar quarter in which the ordinary dilutive issuance occurred; or 	 	 (b) 	 the fifth (5 th ) business day following the date upon which an ivanhoe control transaction is publicly announced during such calendar quarter. subject to section 5.4, the quarterly anti-dilution offer notice will describe the number, price and payment terms of all dilutive ivanhoe shares issued pursuant to each ordinary dilutive issuance that occurred during the calendar quarter or period then ended and the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to rio tinto. upon its receipt of a quarterly anti-dilution offer notice, rio tinto will have the right, for a period of twenty (20) business days, to purchase some or all of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares described in the quarterly anti-dilution offer notice. the payment terms of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to rio tinto shall be no less favourable than the payment terms of the dilutive ivanhoe shares described in the quarterly anti-dilution offer notice. special anti-dilution offer notices back to contents 25 5.3 if, at any time and from time to time, an issuance of dilutive ivanhoe shares (i) results in the aggregate percentage interest of rio tinto and its affiliates in the total number of issued and outstanding ivanhoe shares being reduced by more than one per cent (1%) or (ii) is publicly announced or completed at any time on or after the public announcement, but before the completion, of an ivanhoe control transaction (a &#147;special dilutive issuance&#148;), ivanhoe will give notice to rio tinto (a &#147;special anti-dilution offer notice&#148;) as of the date of the public announcement, if any, of the special dilutive issuance or the date upon which the special dilutive issuance occurs, whichever is earlier. subject to section 5.4, the special anti-dilution offer notice will describe the number, price and payment terms of the dilutive ivanhoe shares issued, or to be issued, pursuant to the special dilutive issuance and the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to rio tinto. upon its receipt of a special anti-dilution offer notice, rio tinto will have the right, for a period of twenty (20) business days after the date upon which the special dilutive share issuance occurs, to purchase some or all of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares described in the special anti-dilution offer notice. the payment terms of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to rio tinto shall be no less favourable than the payment terms of the dilutive ivanhoe shares described in the special anti-dilution offer notice. consideration 5.4 if the consideration paid by the persons to whom ivanhoe issues dilutive ivanhoe shares is: 	 (a) 	 cash, the price at which the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares will be issued to rio tinto will be an amount in cash equal to the price for which each such dilutive ivanhoe share was issued; or 	 (b) 	 other than cash, the price at which the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares will be issued to rio tinto will be an amount in cash equal to the volume-weighted average price of an ivanhoe share on the tsx or such other stock exchange or securities market on which the majority of the trading volume of ivanhoe shares occurs during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date of the public announcement of the ordinary dilutive share issuance or the special dilutive issuance, as the case may be, or the date upon which the dilutive ivanhoe shares are issued, whichever is earlier. acceptance 5.5 rio tinto may accept ivanhoe&#146;s offer as to the full number of anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to it or any lesser number, by notice given to ivanhoe prior to the expiration of the period of time within which rio tinto may exercise its rights in accordance with section 5.2 or section 5.3, as the case may be, in which event ivanhoe will, within ten (10) business days thereafter, sell and rio tinto will buy, upon the terms specified, the number of anti-dilution ivanhoe shares agreed to be purchased by rio tinto. rio tinto&#146;s rights to purchase any anti-dilution ivanhoe shares offered to it pursuant to an anti-dilution offer notice will immediately terminate if and when rio tinto fails to exercise its rights under this part 5 to subscribe for and purchase the maximum number of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares which it has the right to purchase hereunder and, as a result of the issuance of dilutive ivanhoe shares to persons other back to contents 26 than rio tinto, rio tinto&#146;s percentage holding of the issued and outstanding ivanhoe shares is reduced. notwithstanding the foregoing, a failure by rio tinto to fully exercise its rights under this part 5 in respect of any ordinary dilutive issuance or special dilutive issuance is without prejudice to rio tinto&#146;s right to acquire anti-dilution ivanhoe shares in respect of any subsequent ordinary dilutive issuance or special dilutive issuance. pre-emptive warrant rights 5.6 if, at any time prior to the exercise or expiry of all of the series a warrants and series b warrants, rio tinto exercises its right to purchase all or part of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares to which it is entitled, rio tinto will also be entitled to receive, for no additional consideration, a number of additional share purchase warrants (the &#147;anti-dilution ivanhoe warrants&#148;) that would result in rio tinto having the right to acquire, pursuant to the exercise of all outstanding series a warrants, series b warrants and anti-dilution ivanhoe warrants, a number of ivanhoe shares that, upon issuance, would represent the same percentage of the outstanding ivanhoe shares that rio tinto would have beneficially owned if all of the then outstanding series a warrants, series b warrants and anti-dilutive ivanhoe warrants had been fully exercised immediately before the issuance of the dilutive ivanhoe shares and anti-dilution ivanhoe shares. each anti-dilution ivanhoe warrant will entitle rio tinto to purchase one (1) ivanhoe share at a price equal to the issue price per share of the anti-dilution ivanhoe shares. if, when the anti-dilution ivanhoe warrants are issued, any series a warrants remain unexercised and outstanding, that number of the anti-dilution ivanhoe warrants bearing the same proportion as such outstanding number of series a warrants bears to the total number of series a warrants and series b warrants outstanding will have the same terms and attributes as the series a warrants and the remainder of the anti-dilution ivanhoe warrants will have the same terms and attributes as the series b warrants. exempt ivanhoe share transactions 5.7 rio tinto&#146;s pre-emptive rights under this part 5 will not apply to any issuance of ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities pursuant to any of the following transactions (each, an &#147;exempt ivanhoe share transaction&#148;): (a) the award or exercise of any bona fide equity incentive securities or equity compensation securities in favour of directors, officers, employees or service providers of ivanhoe or any of its affiliates pursuant to any bona fide equity incentive plan adopted by ivanhoe and approved by the holders of ivanhoe shares from time to time; (b) the exercise of any ivanhoe convertible securities outstanding as of the date hereof; or (c) any issuance of ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities made to all holders of ivanhoe shares on a pro rata basis. termination of pre-emptive rights back to contents 27 5.8 if, at any time on or after the fifth (5 th ) anniversary of the first closing date, rio tinto and its affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, a number of ivanhoe shares representing less than seven and one-half per cent (7.5%) of the total number of ivanhoe shares issued and outstanding at such time, rio tinto&#146;s rights under this part 5 will immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect. specific performance and injunction 5.9 ivanhoe specifically acknowledges that its obligations under this part 5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. ivanhoe, therefore, specifically acknowledges and agrees that the breach of any of the terms of this part 5 by it would cause rio tinto irreparable harm which may not be compensable in damages. ivanhoe further acknowledges and agrees that it is essential to the effective enforcement of this agreement that rio tinto be entitled to equitable remedies including, but not limited to, specific performance and injunction without being required to show irreparable harm. ivanhoe acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this agreement are just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. part 6 ivanhoe share acquisitions and dispositions standstill covenant 6.1 rio tinto hereby covenants and agrees that, until the fifth (5 th ) anniversary of the date of this agreement, the rio tinto group will not, except with the prior approval of ivanhoe by way of a resolution passed by ivanhoe&#146;s board of directors acting by simple majority or as provided in section 6.2 or section 6.3: (a) engage in any specified activity; (b) prior to having fully exercised all of the series a warrants and the series b warrants, directly or indirectly acquire, alone or jointly or in concert with any other person, any ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities (other than the equity investment securities, anti-dilution securities, ivanhoe shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the series a warrants and the series b warrants, the top up option, the top up private placement shares or ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities acquired through an issuance made to all holders of ivanhoe shares on a pro rata basis) representing, in the aggregate, more than six and sixty five-hundredths per cent (6.65%) of the then issued and outstanding ivanhoe shares from time to time; or (c) after having fully exercised all of the series a warrants and the series b warrants, directly or indirectly acquire, alone or jointly or in concert with any other person, any ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities if, following such acquisition, the rio tinto group and all persons with whom the rio tinto group is acting jointly or in concert, would beneficially own or exercise control back to contents 28 or direction, or be deemed, under applicable law, to beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, more than forty per cent (40%) of the then issued and outstanding ivanhoe shares. for the purposes of this section 6.1, the parties to the shareholders&#146; agreement and their respective affiliates will not be construed to be acting jointly or in concert with one another in exercising their respective rights and performing their respective obligations thereunder. exercise of rights under shareholders&#146; agreement 6.2 nothing in section 6.1 will be construed to restrict rio tinto from acquiring any ivanhoe shares that robert m. friedland beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, pursuant to any rights of first refusal in favour of rio tinto arising under the shareholders&#146; agreement by reason of any proposed sale or disposition of ivanhoe shares by robert m. friedland or any of his affiliates to any person who is not an eligible institutional investor. ivanhoe control transaction 6.3 if, at any time and from time to time, a person or persons jointly or in concert (other than the rio tinto group or a person that is not at arm&#146;s length to the rio tinto group), publicly announces its intention to commence an ivanhoe control transaction, or ivanhoe publicly announces that its board of directors has approved an agreement which contemplates an ivanhoe control transaction, the rio tinto group shall be immediately released from the restrictions of section 6.1 but only for the limited purpose of giving the rio tinto group a reasonable opportunity to propose to ivanhoe and/or commence an alternative ivanhoe control transaction. unless an ivanhoe control transaction results in an ivanhoe change of control within seventy-five (75) days after the rio tinto group is released from the restrictions of section 6.1 or, after the end of such period, rio tinto or any of its affiliates is actively pursuing an alternative ivanhoe control transaction that was commenced during such period, such restrictions will be deemed to have been re-imposed as of the later of the end of such seventy-five (75) day period and the date that rio tinto or any such affiliate completes or ceases actively pursuing its alternative ivanhoe control transaction, pending their expiry or the public announcement of another ivanhoe control transaction as contemplated above. for the purposes of this section 6.3: (a) rio tinto or any of its affiliates will be deemed to be actively pursuing an alternative ivanhoe control transaction at a particular time if, at that time, rio tinto or any such affiliate has made a &#147;formal bid&#148; (as defined under canadian securities laws) that has not expired (and, for greater certainty, which may be extended), for a sufficient number of ivanhoe shares to effect an ivanhoe change of control or rio tinto or any such affiliate is engaged in active negotiations with ivanhoe with respect to such alternative ivanhoe control transaction; and (b) nothing in the shareholders&#146; agreement will be construed as creating a non-arm&#146;s length relationship between the parties to the shareholders&#146; agreement or their respective affiliates. back to contents 29 restriction on disposition of securities 6.4 until the first (1 st ) anniversary of the first closing date, rio tinto covenants and agrees that the rio tinto group will not, except: (a) pursuant to an ivanhoe control transaction; or (b) with the prior written consent of ivanhoe, evidenced by a resolution passed by the ivanhoe board of directors acting by simple majority; or (c) to any person who is a member of the rio tinto group who covenants and agrees in writing with ivanhoe to assume all of rio tinto&#146;s obligations under this agreement in respect of any ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities transferred to it; directly or indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, grant any option or right to purchase, make any short sale, transfer, assign, gift, enter into any derivative transaction in respect of, or otherwise dispose of, alienate or create any encumbrance in respect of (or announce any intention to effect the foregoing) (any of the foregoing, a &#147;transfer&#148;) any ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities (or any voting rights or other rights attributable thereto) beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the rio tinto group, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or in respect of which the rio tinto group exercises control or direction. rio tinto agrees that any purported transfer of any such ivanhoe shares or ivanhoe convertible securities by the rio tinto group contrary to the terms of this section 6.4 will be null and void and of no legal effect and acknowledges that ivanhoe will be entitled to refuse to recognize any such purported transfer. placement rights 6.5 if, at any time after the first (1 st ) anniversary of the first closing date but before the fifth (5 th ) anniversary of the date hereof, rio tinto intends to transfer a number of ivanhoe shares representing five per cent (5%) or more of the total number of ivanhoe shares then issued and outstanding (the &#147;placement shares&#148;) to any person who is not: (a) a member of the rio tinto group who covenants and agrees in writing with ivanhoe to assume all of rio tinto&#146;s obligations under this agreement in respect of the placement shares; or (b) an eligible institutional investor; and the proposed transfer is not being made pursuant to an ivanhoe control transaction, rio tinto will promptly thereafter give to ivanhoe a notice (the &#147;placement offer notice&#148;) offering to ivanhoe the right to arrange for the sale of the placement shares to a third party (a &#147;designated purchaser&#148;) selected by ivanhoe in its absolute discretion, specifying the asking price for each such placement share and the terms of payment in respect of the proposed sale (the &#147;placement offer&#148;). the placement offer must be open for acceptance for not less than sixty (60) days (the &#147;placement offer period&#148;). during the placement offer period, ivanhoe will have the right to arrange for the sale to a designated purchaser of all, but not less than all, of the placement shares at the price and on the terms indicated in the placement offer notice. such right may be back to contents 30 exercised by ivanhoe giving notice to rio tinto within the placement offer period advising of ivanhoe&#146;s intention to arrange for the purchase of the placement shares by a designated purchaser. the placement offer period will end immediately upon ivanhoe having given notice to rio tinto that it is waiving its right to arrange for the sale to a designated purchaser of the placement shares. if ivanhoe notifies rio tinto in accordance with this section 6.5 of its intention to arrange for the sale to a designated purchaser of the placement shares, then a binding agreement of purchase and sale will exist between rio tinto and ivanhoe, as agent for the designated purchaser with respect to such placement shares at and for a cash price equal to that described in the placement offer notice, and on the terms and conditions therein contained, unless, within five (5) business days of its receipt of such notice, rio tinto, acting reasonably, notifies ivanhoe that it rejects the sale of shares to the designated purchaser. if ivanhoe fails to so notify rio tinto or, provided that rio tinto has not rejected the sale of shares to the designated purchaser, fails to complete the sale of the placement shares to the designated purchaser within the placement offer period, then ivanhoe will be conclusively deemed to have waived its right to arrange for the sale of the placement shares under this section 6.5 and rio tinto may, within sixty (60) days after the expiry of the placement offer period sell the placement shares at a cash price per placement share not less, and on terms and conditions no less favourable to rio tinto, than the price per placement share and terms and conditions set forth in the placement offer notice. in the event that rio tinto does not sell the placement shares within the sixty (60) day period referred to above or if the terms of any proposed sale are less favourable to rio tinto than those set out in the placement offer notice or if rio tinto rejects the sale of shares to the designated purchaser, then the provisions of this section 6.5 will once again apply. ivanhoe agrees to comply with all applicable laws, including applicable canadian securities laws, in connection with the purchase and sale of any placement shares. part 7 ot project participation right of first refusal 7.1 subject to section 7.2, if, at any time and from time to time after the first closing date, ivanhoe proposes to, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, grant any option or right to purchase, transfer, assign, gift, otherwise dispose of, alienate or create any encumbrance in respect of any beneficial or legal ownership interest including, without limitation, any participating interest, carried interest, royalty interest or voting interest, in the ot project (the &#147;ot disposal interest&#148;) to a third party in any transaction other than a transaction contemplated by section 7.3 (an &#147;ot disposal transaction&#148;), ivanhoe may only effect such ot disposal transaction on bona fide arm&#146;s length terms and must give notice (an &#147;ot disposal notice&#148;) to rio tinto, identifying the third party offeror and its ultimate beneficial owner(s), if and to the extent reasonably known, and offering the ot disposal interest to rio tinto on the same (or, as near as is possible, financially equivalent) terms and conditions upon which ivanhoe has received an offer from a third party to convey the ot disposal interest to such third party. upon receiving an ot disposal notice, rio tinto or, at its direction, an affiliate of rio tinto, will have the right (the &#147;ot right of first refusal&#148;) to acquire all, but not less than all, of the ot disposal interest for the consideration stipulated in the ot disposal notice (provided that if all or any part of the consideration offered by the third party is non-monetary, rio tinto or, at its back to contents 31 direction, an affiliate of rio tinto, may elect to furnish the same non-monetary consideration or to pay to ivanhoe an amount of money equal to the fair market value, as determined by the parties, acting reasonably, of the non-monetary consideration offered by the third party). if the parties, acting reasonably, are unable to agree upon the fair market value of any such non-monetary consideration, such fair market value will be conclusively determined by an internationally recognized investment bank mutually acceptable to the parties, acting reasonably, and that has not been engaged by either of the parties or their respective affiliates in any capacity during the preceding twelve (12) months. rio tinto or, at its direction, an affiliate of rio tinto, may exercise the ot right of first refusal by providing notice to ivanhoe within sixty (60) days of receipt by rio tinto of the ot disposal notice (the &#147;ot exercise period&#148;). if rio tinto or its affiliate, as applicable, exercises the ot right of first refusal, then a binding agreement of purchase and sale will exist between rio tinto or its affiliate, as applicable, and ivanhoe with respect to the ot disposal interest for the consideration stipulated in the ot disposal notice (subject to rio tinto&#146;s or its affiliate&#146;s, as applicable right to pay cash in lieu of any non-monetary consideration as hereinbefore provided), and on the terms and conditions therein contained. if the ot right of first refusal is not exercised prior to the expiry of the ot exercise period, ivanhoe will have the right for a period of sixty (60) days following the ot exercise period (the &#147;ot closing period&#148;) to convey the ot disposal interest to the third party from whom it received the offer that was specifically named in the ot disposal notice for consideration having a value equal to or higher than the value of the consideration for which ivanhoe offered the ot disposal interest to rio tinto and on terms and conditions no less favourable to ivanhoe than those set out in the ot disposal notice. if ivanhoe does not convey the ot disposal interest to such third party by the expiry of the ot closing period, such ot disposal interest will again become subject to the ot right of first refusal. ivanhoe covenants and agrees that it will not, on or before the first closing date, enter into any ot disposal transaction that would, after the first closing date, require ivanhoe to deliver an ot disposal notice to rio tinto. condition precedent 7.2 the ot right of first refusal will be inoperative unless, at the time that ivanhoe proposes to enter into an ot disposal transaction, rio tinto and its affiliates beneficially own (disregarding any unissued ivanhoe shares underlying any unexercised series a warrants or series b warrants), in the aggregate, a number of ivanhoe shares that is equal to or greater than the aggregate of the first tranche private placement shares and the basic second tranche private placement shares. notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time before rio tinto and its affiliates beneficially own (disregarding any unissued ivanhoe shares underlying any unexercised series a warrants or series b warrants), in the aggregate, a number of ivanhoe shares that is equal to or greater than the aggregate of the first tranche private placement shares and the basic second tranche private placement shares, ivanhoe, or a subsidiary of ivanhoe will not enter into any legally binding commitment with a third party to effect an ivanhoe disposal transaction unless: (a) such legally binding commitment is conditional upon the exercise or waiver by rio tinto of the ot right of first refusal; and back to contents 32 (b) upon entering into such legally binding commitment, ivanhoe promptly delivers to rio tinto an ot disposal notice. provided that rio tinto gives notice to ivanhoe that rio tinto is making the election contemplated by section 2.9 at or before the end of the ot exercise period, rio tinto will have the right to exercise the ot right of first refusal in accordance with the terms of section 7.1. exempt dispositions 7.3 the disposition of an ot disposal interest pursuant to any of the following transactions will be deemed not to be an ot disposal transaction to which the ot right of first refusal applies: (a) any disposition of an ot disposal interest by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ivanhoe to another wholly-owned subsidiary of ivanhoe; (b) any disposition or series of dispositions of an ot disposal interest to the government of mongolia or any entity beneficially owned or controlled by the government of mongolia; (c) any disposition or series of dispositions of an ot disposal interest to one or more third parties mandated by the government of mongolia; or (d) an ivanhoe control transaction. ot project participation discussions 7.4 from and after the date hereof, the parties undertake to consult with one another from time to time with respect to possible opportunities for the rio tinto group to participate in the ot project on a basis other than, or in addition to, the basis contemplated by this agreement. such participation may include, without limitation, a member of the rio tinto group having a direct participating interest in the ot project. the parties acknowledge that: (a) on the date hereof, no member of the rio tinto group is a &#147;related party&#148; of ivanhoe for the purposes of canadian securities laws; (b) as a result of the equity investment, the members of the rio tinto group may become &#147;related parties&#148; of ivanhoe for the purposes of canadian securities laws; and (c) unless exempt, material transactions entered into between ivanhoe and its related parties (other than any transaction entered into between ivanhoe and rio tinto or an affiliate of rio tinto pursuant to section 7.1) are subject to special rules under canadian securities laws, including requirements for independent valuations and prior approval by disinterested shareholders. the parties further acknowledge that the ot right of first refusal has been negotiated by the parties at arm&#146;s length and that any exercise by rio tinto or any of its affiliates of the ot right of first refusal at a time when rio tinto and such affiliate is a related party of ivanhoe back to contents 33 would not be subject to special rules under canadian securities laws, including requirements for independent valuations and/or prior approval by disinterested shareholders by reason of the application of section 5.1(h)(iii) of ontario securities commission rule 61-501 insider bids, issuer bids, business combination and related party transactions . the obligations of the parties in this section 7.4 are limited to discussing possible opportunities for the rio tinto group to participate in the ot project on a basis other than, or in addition to, the basis contemplated by this agreement and nothing in this section 7.4 is intended to create any legally binding obligations on the part of either ivanhoe or rio tinto to participate in any transaction. specific performance and injunction 7.5 ivanhoe specifically acknowledges that the right of first refusal contained in section 7.1 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this agreement. ivanhoe, therefore, specifically acknowledges and agrees that the breach of any of the terms of section 7.1 would cause rio tinto irreparable harm that may not be compensable in damages. ivanhoe further acknowledges and agrees that it is essential to the effective enforcement of this agreement that rio tinto be entitled to equitable remedies including, but not limited to specific performance and injunction without being required to show irreparable harm. having regard to the significant investment being made by rio tinto in ivanhoe, ivanhoe acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this agreement are just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. part 8 technical committee establishment and purpose 8.1 as of the first closing date, ivanhoe and rio tinto will establish a committee (the &#147;technical

be exercisable during the exercise period. 3. expiry time 3.1 after the expiry time, all rights under any series a warrants evidenced hereby which remain unexercised at the expiry time shall wholly cease and terminate and such series a warrants shall be null and void and of no value or effect. 4. exercise procedure 4.1 the holder may exercise its rights hereunder to purchase common shares during

to this series a warrant certificate and which were then not purchased. 7 . no fractional shares 7.1 notwithstanding any adjustments provided for in part 10 hereof or otherwise, the company shall not be required upon the exercise of any series a warrants, to issue fractional common shares in satisfaction of its obligations hereunder. to the extent that the holder would be entitled to purchase a fraction of a common share, such right may be exercised in respect of such fraction only in combination with other rights which, in the aggregate, entitle the holder to purchase a whole number of common shares. 8 . not a shareholder 8.1 nothing in this series a warrant certificate or in the holding of the series a warrants nothing in this series a warrant certificate or in the holding of the series a warrants evidenced hereby shall be construed as conferring upon the holder any right or interest whatsoever as a shareholder of the company. 9. covenants 9.1 the company hereby covenants and agrees that: 	 	 	 	 (a) 	 so long as any series a warrants evidenced hereby remain outstanding, it shall reserve and there shall remain unissued out of its authorized capital a sufficient number of common shares to satisfy the maximum right of purchase provided for herein; 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 (b) 	 all common shares which shall be issued upon the exercise of any series a warrants hereunder shall, upon payment therefor of the then prevailing exercise price, be issued as fully paid and non-assessable common shares; and 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 (c) 	 it will at its expense expediously use its best efforts to obtain the listing of such common shares (subject to issue and notice of issue) on each stock exchange, securities market or over-the-counter market on which the common shares may be listed from time to time. 10. adjustment to exercise price 10.1 the exercise price in effect at any time is subject to adjustment from time to time in the events and in the manner provided in this part 10. back to contents 7 	 10.2 	 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company: 	 (a) 	 issues common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares to all or substantially all the holders of the common shares as a stock dividend; or 	 (b) 	 makes a distribution on its outstanding common shares payable in common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares; or 	 (c) 	 subdivides its outstanding common shares into a greater number of shares; or 	 (d) 	 consolidates its outstanding common shares into a lesser number of shares; (any of such events being called a "common share reorganization"), then the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the effective date or record date, whichever is earlier, for the happening of a common share reorganization at which the holders of common shares are determined for the purpose of the common share reorganization by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of common shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such common share reorganization and the denominator of which is the number of common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such common share reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares are distributed, the number of common shares that would have been outstanding had all such securities been exchanged for or converted into common shares on such effective date or record date). 10.3 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.2 as a result of the fixing by the company of a record date for the distribution of securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange or conversion right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. if the holder has not exercised all of the series a warrants on or prior to the record date of any stock dividend or distribution or the effective date of any subdivision or consolidation, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such series a warrants thereafter, the holder shall be entitled to receive and shall accept in lieu of the number of common shares then subscribed for and purchased by the holder, at the exercise price determined in accordance with section 10.2, the aggregate number of common shares that the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such common share reorganization, if, on such record date or effective date, as the case may be, the holder had been the holder of record of the number of common shares so subscribed for and purchased. 10.4 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company fixes a record date for the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of its outstanding common shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, where: back to contents 8 	 (a) 	 the right to subscribe for or purchase common shares, or the right to exchange securities for or convert securities into common shares, expires not more than forty five (45) days after the date of such issue (the period from the record date to the date of expiry being referred to as the "rights period"); and 	 (b) 	 the cost per common share during the rights period (inclusive of any cost or acquisition of securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares in addition to any direct cost of common shares) (such cost being referred to as the "per share cost") is less than 95% of the current market price of the common shares on the record date; (any of such events being referred to as a "rights offering"), then the exercise price will be adjusted to a price determined in accordance with section 10.5. 10.5 in the event of a rights offering, the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the end of the rights period to a price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the end of the rights period by a fraction: 	 (a) 	 the numerator of which is the aggregate of: 	 (i) 	 the number of common shares outstanding as of the record date for the rights offering; and 	 (ii) 	 a number determined by dividing the product of the per share cost and: 	 a. 	 where the event giving rise to the application of this section 10.5 was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of common shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase additional common shares, the number of common shares so subscribed for or purchased during the rights period, or 	 b. 	 where the event giving rise to the application of this section 10.5 was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of common shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, the number of common shares for which those securities so subscribed for or purchased during the rights period could have been exchanged or into which they could have been converted, 	 by the current market price of the common shares as of the record date for the rights offering; and 	 (b) 	 the denominator of which is back to contents 9 	 	 	 (i) 	 in the case described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)a., the number of common shares outstanding, or (ii) in the case described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)b., the number of common shares that would be outstanding if all the common shares described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)b. had been issued, 	 	 	 as at the end of the rights period. any common shares owned by or held for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the company will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. 10.6 if, by the terms of any rights, options or warrants referred to in this part 10, there is more than one purchase, conversion or exchange price per common share, the per share cost will be calculated for purposes of the adjustment with reference to the aggregate price of the total number of additional common shares offered for subscription or purchase, or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible securities so offered, on the basis of the lowest purchase, conversion or exchange price per common share, as the case may be. 10.7 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.5 as a result of the the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10.5, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. 10.8 if the holder has exercised any series a warrants in accordance herewith during the period beginning immediately after the record date for a rights offering and ending on the last day of the rights period therefor, the holder will, in addition to the common shares to which it is otherwise entitled upon such exercise, be entitled to that number of additional common shares equal to the result obtained when the difference, if any, between: 	 (a) 	 the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the end of such rights offering; and 	 (b) 	 the exercise price as adjusted hereunder for such rights offering; is multiplied by the number of common shares received upon the exercise of such series a warrants during such period, and the resulting product is divided by the exercise price as adjusted hereunder for such rights offering, provided that the provisions of section 7.1 will be applicable to any fractional interest in a common share to which the holder might otherwise be entitled. such additional common shares will be deemed to have been issued to the holder immediately following the end of the rights period and a certificate for such additional common shares will be delivered to the holder within ten (10) business days following the end of the rights period. back to contents 10 10.9 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company fixes a record date for the issue or the distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of its common shares of: 	 	 (a) 	 shares of the company of any class other than common shares, 	 	 (b) 	 rights, options or warrants to acquire: 	 (i) 	 common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares (other than rights, options or warrants of the nature described in section 10.4), or 	 (ii) 	 shares other than common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares other than common shares or property or other assets of the company, 	 	 (c) 	 evidences of indebtedness, or 	 	 (d) 	 any property or other assets and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute a common share reorganization or a rights offering (any of such non-excluded events being referred to as a "special distribution"), the exercise price will be adjusted in accordance with section 10.10. 10.10 in the event of a special distribution, the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the record date for the special distribution to a price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect on such record date by a fraction: 	 	 (a) 	 the numerator of which is: 	 (i) 	 the product of the number of common shares outstanding on such record date and the current market price of the common shares on such record date; less 	 (ii) 	 the aggregate fair market value (as determined by the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith) to the holders of the common shares of such securities or property or other assets so issued or distributed in the special distribution; and 	 	 (b) 	 the denominator of which is the number of common shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the current market price of the common shares on such record date. any common shares owned by or held for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the back to contents 11 company will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. 10.11 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.10 as a result of the the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10.10, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. 10.12 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, there is a reclassification or redesignation of the common shares outstanding at any time or change of the common shares into other shares or into other securities (other than a common share reorganization), or a consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the company with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger which does not result in any reclassification or redesignation of the outstanding common shares or a change of the common shares into other shares), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity (any of such events being referred to as a "capital reorganization"), the holder, upon exercising any series a warrants after the effective date of such capital reorganization, will be entitled to receive in lieu of the number of common shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such capital reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the holder had been the registered holder of the number of common shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise of such series a warrants. 10.13 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, there is a common share reorganization, a rights offering or a special distribution, that results in an adjustment pursuant to sections 10.2, 10.5 or 10.10, as the case may be, or a readjustment pursuant to sections 10.3, 10.7 or 10.11, as the case may be, in the exercise price, then the number of common shares acquirable upon the subsequent exercise of the series a warrants shall be simultaneously adjusted or readjusted, as the case may be, by multiplying the number of common shares acquirable upon the exercise of the series a warrants immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment by a fraction which shall be the reciprocal of the fraction used in the adjustment or readjustment of the exercise price. 11. rules regarding calculation of adjustment of exercise price 11.1 the adjustments provided for in part 10 are cumulative and will, in the case of adjustments to the exercise price, be computed to the nearest one-tenth of one cent and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following provisions of this part 11. 11.2 no adjustment in the exercise price is required to be made unless such adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% in the prevailing exercise price; provided, however, that any adjustments which, except for the provisions of this section 11.2, would otherwise have been required to be made, will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustments. back to contents 12 11.3 no adjustment in the exercise price (or in the number of common shares acquirable upon the exercise of the series a warrants pursuant to section 10.13) will be made in respect of any event described in part 10, other than the events referred to in subsections 10(2)(c) and (d), if the holder is entitled to participate in such event on the same terms, mutatis mutandis , as if the holder had exercised its series a warrants prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event, or if the company makes adequate provision for the holder to participate in such event on the same terms or with the same effect, mutatis mutandis , upon the subsequent exercise of the series a warrants (the adequacy of such provisions to be determined by the holder in its sole discretion, acting reasonably). 11.4 no adjustment in the exercise price will be made under part 10 in respect of the issue from time to time of common shares as dividends paid in the ordinary course to holders of common shares who exercise an option or election to receive substantially equivalent dividends in common shares in lieu of receiving a cash dividend, and any such issue will be deemed not to be a common share reorganization. 11.5 if at any time a dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in part 10, such dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditors of the company or if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, and any such determination will be binding upon the company, the holder and the shareholders of the company. 11.6 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company takes any action affecting the common shares, other than action described in part 10, which in the opinion of the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, would materially affect the rights of the holder, the exercise price will be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time, by action of the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, but subject in all cases to any necessary exchange approval or other regulatory approval. failure by the board of directors of the company to take action so as to provide for an adjustment on or prior to the effective date of any action by the company affecting the common shares will be conclusive evidence that the board of directors of the company has determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. 11.7 if the company sets a record date to determine the holders of the common shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or distribution or sets a record date to take any other action and, thereafter and before the distribution to such shareholders of any such dividend or distribution or the taking of any other action, decides not to implement its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution or take such other action, then no adjustment in the exercise price will be required by reason of the setting of such record date. 11.8 in the absence of a resolution of the board of directors of the company fixing a record date for a special distribution or rights offering, the company will be deemed to have fixed as the record date therefor the date on which the special distribution or rights offering is effected. 11.9 as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require any adjustment to the series a warrants, including the exercise price, the company must take any corporate action which may be necessary in order that the company have unissued and reserved in its authorized back to contents 13 capital, and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable, all the shares or other securities which the holder is entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 11.10 the company will from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in part 10, forthwith give notice to the holder specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the results thereof, including the resulting exercise price. 11.11 the company covenants to and in favour of the holder that so long as any series a warrants remain outstanding, it will give notice to the holder of its intention to fix a record date for any common share reorganization (other than the subdivision or consolidation of the common shares), rights offering or special distribution which may give rise to an adjustment in the exercise price, and, in each case, such notice must specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the company is only required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. such notice must be given not less than fourteen (14) days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date. 12 consolidation and amalgamation 12.1 the company shall not enter into any transaction whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and assets would become the property of any other corporation (herein called a "successor corporation") whether by way of reorganization, reconstruction, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, transfer, sale, disposition or otherwise, unless prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction the company and the successor corporation shall have executed such instruments and done such things as, in the opinion of counsel to the holder, are necessary or advisable to establish that upon the consummation of such transaction: (a) the successor corporation will have assumed all the covenants and obligations of the company under this series a warrant certificate; and (b) this series a warrant certificate will be a valid and binding obligation of the successor corporation entitling the holder, as against the successor corporation, to all the rights of the holder under this series a warrant certificate. 12.2 whenever the conditions of section 12.1 shall have been duly observed and performed the successor corporation shall possess, and from time to time may exercise, each and every right and power of the company under this series a warrant certificate in the name of the company or otherwise and any act or proceeding by any provision hereof required to be done or performed by any director or officer of the company may be done and performed with like force and effect by the like directors or officers of the successor corporation. 13. representation and warranty back to contents 14 13.1 the company hereby represents and warrants with and to the holder that the company is duly authorized and has the corporate and lawful power and authority to create and issue the series a warrants represented hereby and the common shares issuable upon the exercise hereof and to perform its obligations hereunder and that this series a warrant certificate represents a valid, legal and binding obligation of the company enforceable in accordance with its terms. 14. if share transfer books closed 14.1 the company shall not be required to deliver certificates for common shares while the share transfer books of the company are properly closed, prior to any meeting of shareholders or for the payment of dividends or for any other purpose and, in the event of the exercise of any series a warrants in accordance with the provisions hereof and the making of any subscription and payment for the common shares pursuant thereto during any such period, delivery of certificates for common shares may be postponed for a period not exceeding three (3) business days after the date of the re- opening of said share transfer books. provided however that any such postponement of delivery of certificates shall be without prejudice to the right of the holder, if the holder has exercised any series a warrants and made payment during such period, to receive such certificates for the common shares subscribed for after the share transfer books shall have been re-opened. 15. protection of shareholders, officers and directors 15.1 subject as herein provided, all or any of the rights conferred upon the holder may be enforced by the holder by appropriate legal proceedings. no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement herein contained or in any of the series a warrants represented hereby shall be taken against any shareholder, officer or director of the company, either directly or through the company, it being expressly agreed and

represented hereby becomes stolen, lost, mutilated or destroyed, the company may, upon delivery to it by the holder of an appropriate indemnity, issue and countersign a new series a warrant certificate of like denomination, tenor and date as the certificate so stolen, lost mutilated or destroyed. 17. governing law back to contents 15 17.1 this warrant shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the province of british columbia and the laws of canada applicable therein but the reference to such laws shall not, by conflict of laws rules or otherwise, require the

certificate should be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions or parts thereof contained herein shall be and shall be conclusively deemed to be, as to such jurisdiction, severable therefrom and: (a) the validity, legality or enforceability of such remaining provisions or parts thereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired by the severance of the provisions or parts thereof severed; and (b) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any provision or part thereof contained in this series a warrant certificate in

market or over-the-counter market on which the common shares may be listed from time to time. 10. adjustment to exercise price 10.1 the exercise price in effect at any time is subject to adjustment from time to time in the events and in the manner provided in this part 10. 10.2 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company: (a) issues common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares to all or substantially all the holders of the common shares as a stock dividend; or (b) makes a distribution on its outstanding common shares payable in common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares; or (c) subdivides its outstanding common shares into a greater number of shares; or (d) consolidates its outstanding common shares into a lesser number of shares; (any of such events being called a "common share reorganization"), then the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the effective date or record date, whichever is earlier, for the happening of a common share reorganization at which the holders of common shares are determined for the purpose of the common share reorganization by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of common shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such common share reorganization and the denominator of which is the number of common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such common share reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares are distributed, the number of common shares that would have been outstanding had all such securities been exchanged for or converted into common shares on such effective date or record date). 10.3 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.2 as a result of the fixing by the company of a record date for the distribution of securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange or conversion right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. if the holder has not exercised all of the series b warrants on or prior to the record date of any stock dividend or distribution or the effective date of any subdivision or consolidation, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such series b warrants thereafter, the holder shall be entitled to receive and shall accept in lieu of the back to contents 8 number of common shares then subscribed for and purchased by the holder, at the exercise price determined in accordance with section 10.2, the aggregate number of common shares that the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such common share reorganization, if, on such record date or effective date, as the case may be, the holder had been the holder of record of the number of common shares so subscribed for and purchased. 10.4 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company fixes a record date for the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of its outstanding common shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, where: (a) the right to subscribe for or purchase common shares, or the right to exchange securities for or convert securities into common shares, expires not more than forty five (45) days after the date of such issue (the period from the record date to the date of expiry being referred to as the "rights period"); and (b) the cost per common share during the rights period (inclusive of any cost or acquisition of securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares in addition to any direct cost of common shares) (such cost being referred to as the "per share cost") is less than 95% of the current market price of the common shares on the record date; (any of such events being referred to as a "rights offering"), then the exercise price will be adjusted to a price determined in accordance with section 10.5. 10.5 in the event of a rights offering, the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the end of the rights period to a price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the end of the rights period by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which is the aggregate of: (i) the number of common shares outstanding as of the record date for the rights offering; and (ii) a number determined by dividing the product of the per share cost and: a. where the event giving rise to the application of this section 10.5 was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of common shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase additional common shares, the number of common shares so subscribed for or purchased during the rights period, or b. where the event giving rise to the application of this section 10.5 was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of common back to contents 9 shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, the number of common shares for which those securities so subscribed for or purchased during the rights period could have been exchanged or into which they could have been converted, by the current market price of the common shares as of the record date for the rights offering; and (b) the denominator of which is (i) in the case described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)a., the number of common shares outstanding, or (ii) in the case described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)b., the number of common shares that would be outstanding if all the common shares described in subsection 10.5(a)(ii)b. had been issued, as at the end of the rights period. any common shares owned by or held for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the company will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. 10.6 if, by the terms of any rights, options or warrants referred to in this part 10, there is more than one purchase, conversion or exchange price per common share, the per share cost will be calculated for purposes of the adjustment with reference to the aggregate price of the total number of additional common shares offered for subscription or purchase, or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible securities so offered, on the basis of the lowest purchase, conversion or exchange price per common share, as the case may be. 10.7 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.5 as a result of the the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10.5, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. 10.8 if the holder has exercised any series b warrants in accordance herewith during the period beginning immediately after the record date for a rights offering and ending on the last day of the rights period therefor, the holder will, in addition to the common shares to which it is otherwise entitled upon such exercise, be entitled to that number of additional common shares equal to the result obtained when the difference, if any, between: (a) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the end of such rights offering; and back to contents 10 (b) the exercise price as adjusted hereunder for such rights offering; is multiplied by the number of common shares received upon the exercise of such series b warrants during such period, and the resulting product is divided by the exercise price as adjusted hereunder for such rights offering, provided that the provisions of section 7.1 will be applicable to any fractional interest in a common share to which the holder might otherwise be entitled. such additional common shares will be deemed to have been issued to the holder immediately following the end of the rights period and a certificate for such additional common shares will be delivered to the holder within ten (10) business days following the end of the rights period. 10.9 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company fixes a record date for the issue or the distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of its common shares of: (a) shares of the company of any class other than common shares, (b) rights, options or warrants to acquire: (i) common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares (other than rights, options or warrants of the nature described in section 10.4), or (ii) shares other than common shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares other than common shares or property or other assets of the company, (c) evidences of indebtedness, or (d) any property or other assets and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute a common share reorganization or a rights offering (any of such non-excluded events being referred to as a "special distribution"), the exercise price will be adjusted in accordance with section 10.10. 10.10 in the event of a special distribution, the exercise price will be adjusted effective immediately after the record date for the special distribution to a price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect on such record date by a fraction: (a) the numerator of which is: (i) the product of the number of common shares outstanding on such record date and the current market price of the common shares on such record date; less back to contents 11 (ii) the aggregate fair market value (as determined by the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith) to the holders of the common shares of such securities or property or other assets so issued or distributed in the special distribution; and (b) the denominator of which is the number of common shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the current market price of the common shares on such record date. any common shares owned by or held for the account of the company or any subsidiary of the company will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. 10.11 to the extent that any adjustment in the exercise price occurs pursuant to section 10.10 as a result of the the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in section 10.10, the exercise price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the exercise price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. 10.12 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, there is a reclassification or redesignation of the common shares outstanding at any time or change of the common shares into other shares or into other securities (other than a common share reorganization), or a consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the company with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger which does not result in any reclassification or redesignation of the outstanding common shares or a change of the common shares into other shares), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity (any of such events being referred to as a "capital reorganization"), the holder, upon exercising any series b warrants after the effective date of such capital reorganization, will be entitled to receive in lieu of the number of common shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such capital reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the holder had been the registered holder of the number of common shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise of such series b warrants. 10.13 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, there is a common share reorganization, a rights offering or a special distribution, that results in an adjustment pursuant to sections 10.2, 10.5 or 10.10, as the case may be, or a readjustment pursuant to sections 10.3, 10.7 or 10.11, as the case may be, in the exercise price, then the number of common shares acquirable upon the subsequent exercise of the series b warrants shall be simultaneously adjusted or readjusted, as the case may be, by multiplying the number of common shares acquirable upon the exercise of the series b warrants immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment by a fraction which shall be the reciprocal of the fraction used in the adjustment or readjustment of the exercise price. 11. rules regarding calculation of adjustment of exercise price back to contents 12 11.1 the adjustments provided for in part 10 are cumulative and will, in the case of adjustments to the exercise price, be computed to the nearest one-tenth of one cent and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following provisions of this part 11. 11.2 no adjustment in the exercise price is required to be made unless such adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% in the prevailing exercise price; provided, however, that any adjustments which, except for the provisions of this section 11.2, would otherwise have been required to be made, will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustments. 11.3 no adjustment in the exercise price (or in the number of common shares acquirable upon the exercise of the series b warrants pursuant to section 10.13) will be made in respect of any event described in part 10, other than the events referred to in subsections 10(2)(c) and (d), if the holder is entitled to participate in such event on the same terms, mutatis mutandis , as if the holder had exercised its series b warrants prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event, or if the company makes adequate provision for the holder to participate in such event on the same terms or with the same effect, mutatis mutandis , upon the subsequent exercise of the series b warrants (the adequacy of such provisions to be determined by the holder in its sole discretion, acting reasonably). 11.4 no adjustment in the exercise price will be made under part 10 in respect of the issue from time to time of common shares as dividends paid in the ordinary course to holders of common shares who exercise an option or election to receive substantially equivalent dividends in common shares in lieu of receiving a cash dividend, and any such issue will be deemed not to be a common share reorganization. 11.5 if at any time a dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in part 10, such dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditors of the company or if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, and any such determination will be binding upon the company, the holder and the shareholders of the company. 11.6 if, and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the company takes any action affecting the common shares, other than action described in part 10, which in the opinion of the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, would materially affect the rights of the holder, the exercise price will be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time, by action of the board of directors of the company, acting reasonably and in good faith, but subject in all cases to any necessary exchange approval or other regulatory approval. failure by the board of directors of the company to take action so as to provide for an adjustment on or prior to the effective date of any action by the company affecting the common shares will be conclusive evidence that the board of directors of the company has determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. 11.7 if the company sets a record date to determine the holders of the common shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or distribution or sets a record date to take any other action and, thereafter and before the distribution to such shareholders of any such dividend or distribution or the taking of any other action, decides not to implement its plan to pay or deliver such back to contents 13 dividend or distribution or take such other action, then no adjustment in the exercise price will be required by reason of the setting of such record date. 11.8 in the absence of a resolution of the board of directors of the company fixing a record date for a special distribution or rights offering, the company will be deemed to have fixed as the record date therefor the date on which the special distribution or rights offering is effected. 11.9 as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require any adjustment to the series b warrants, including the exercise price, the company must take any corporate action which may be necessary in order that the company have unissued and reserved in its authorized capital, and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable, all the shares or other securities which the holder is entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 11.10 the company will from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in part 10, forthwith give notice to the holder specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the results thereof, including the resulting

without complying with section 4.3, all or any of his owned securities to a permitted transferee of rmf. right of first refusal back to contents 4.3 rmf may transfer his owned securities to a third party pursuant to an offer received from that third party (the &#147;rfr offered securities&#148;), provided that rmf may only effect a transfer of such rmf offered securities on bona fide arm&#146;s length terms and must give notice (an &#147;rfr offer notice &#147;) to rio tinto, identifying the third party offeree and its ultimate beneficial owner(s), if and to the extent reasonably known, and offering the rfr offered securities to rio tinto at the same cash price and on the same terms upon which rfr has received an offer from a third party to convey rfr offered securities to such third party. upon receiving an rfr offer notice, rio tinto or, at its direction, an affiliate of rio tinto, will have the right (the &#147;right of first refusal&#148;) to acquire all, but not less than all, of the rfr offered securities for the consideration stipulated in the rfr offer notice. rio tinto or, at is direction, an affiliate of rio tinto, may exercise the right of first refusal by providing notice to ivanhoe within sixty (60) days of receipt by rio tinto of the rfr offer notice (the &#147;rfr exercise period&#148;). if rio tinto or its affiliate, as applicable, exercises the right of first refusal, then a binding agreement of purchase and sale will exist between rio tinto or its affiliate, as applicable, and rmf with respect to the rfr offered securities for the consideration stipulated in the rfr offer notice, and on the terms and conditions therein contained. if the right of first refusal is not exercised prior to the expiry of the rfr exercise period, rmf will have the right for a period of sixty (60) days following the rfr exercise period (the &#147;closing period&#148;) to convey the rfr offered securities to the third party from whom it received the offer that was specifically named in the rfr offer notice for cash consideration having a value equal to or higher than the value of the cash consideration for which rmf offered the rfr offered securities to rio tinto and on terms and conditions no less favourable to rmf than those set out in the rfr offer notice. if rmf does not convey the rfr offered securities to such third party before the expiry of the closing period, such rfr offered securities will again become subject to the right of first refusal. rio tinto placement rights 4.4 if rmf gives an rfr offer notice to rio tinto and the purchase by rio tinto of all or a portion of the rfr offered securities would: (i) constitute a &#147;take-over bid&#148; (within the meaning of canadian provincial securities laws) in which rio tinto would be obligated to tender a &#147;formal bid&#148; (within the meaning of canadian provincial securities laws) in order to purchase the rfr offered securities; or (ii) cause the rio tinto and its affiliates to, upon completion of the purchase thereunder, beneficially own, or exercise control or direction of more than forty per cent (40%) of the then issued and outstanding shares ((i) and (ii) being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the &#147;purchase limitations&#148;), then rio tinto will be entitled to exercise a placement right in the manner set forth in this section 4.4 (the &#147;placement right&#148;). pursuant to the placement right and subject to rio tinto&#146;s other rights under this section 4.4, rio tinto may at any time during the applicable rfr exercise period for the rfr offered securities, in lieu of exercising the right of first refusal, deliver a notice to rmf of its intent to arrange for the sale of all, but not less than all, of the rfr offered securities to a third party selected by rio tinto in its absolute discretion (a &#147;designated purchaser&#148;). if the purchase by rio tinto or any of its affiliates of less than all of the rfr offered securities would not contravene the purchase limitations, rio tinto may elect to purchase, or cause an affiliate of rio tinto to purchase, such number of the rfr offered securities as would not contravene the purchase limitations. any notice delivered pursuant to this section 4.4 shall include a certification by rio tinto respecting the applicability in the circumstances of the purchase limitations and details respecting the allocation, if any, of the rfr offered securities as between the designated purchaser and rio back to contents tinto or any of its affiliates. upon delivery of such notice by rio tinto to rmf in accordance with this section 4.4, a binding agreement of purchase and sale will exist: (a) between rmf and rio tinto, as agent for the designated purchaser, respecting the purchase by the designated purchaser of the allocated number of rfr offered securities (the &#147;designated purchaser transaction&#148;); and (b) if rio tinto or any of its affiliates is purchasing any of the rfr offered securities, between rmf and rio tinto, on behalf of itself or any of its affiliates, respecting the purchase by rio tinto or any such affiliate of the allocated number of rfr offered securities (the &#147;rio tinto transaction&#148;); at and for a cash price equal to that described in the rfr offer notice, and on the terms and conditions therein contained. the designated purchaser transaction and the rio tinto transaction will be cross-conditional and if either such transaction is not completed, or if rio tinto fails to give notice to rmf exercising the placement right, within the rfr exercise period, then rio tinto will be conclusively deemed to have waived its right to exercise the placement right in respect of the rfr offered securities and rmf may, within sixty (60) days after the expiry of the rfr exercise period, sell the rfr offered securities at a cash price per rfr offered security not less than, and on terms and conditions no less favourable to rmf than, the price per rfr offered security and otherwise on the terms and conditions set out in the rfr offer notice. the parties agree to comply with all applicable laws, including applicable securities laws, in connection with the purchase and sale of any rfr offered securities. in the event that rmf does not sell the rfr offered securities within the sixty (60) day period referred to above or if the terms of any proposed sale are less favourable to rmf than those set out in the rfr offer notice, then the placement right will once again apply. specific performance and injunction 4.5 rmf specifically acknowledges that the restrictions on dispositions of securities and right of first refusal contained in this part 4 is an integral part of the transactions
