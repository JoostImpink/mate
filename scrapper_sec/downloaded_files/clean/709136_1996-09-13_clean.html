e&j (as described in item 5), pursuant to which acquisition corp. will merge with and into e&j, with e&j surviving as a wholly- owned subsidiary of graham-field (the "merger"). a copy of the merger agreement is filed as exhibit 1 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of e&j common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), other than shares of e&j common stock canceled pursuant to the merger agreement, will be converted into the right to receive .35 (the "conversion number") shares of common stock, par value $.025 per share, of graham-field (the "graham-field common stock"); provided that the conversion number will be reduced to the extent necessary so that the maximum value (determined as set forth in the merger agreement) of the fraction of a share of graham-field common stock into which each share of e&j common stock is converted in the merger will not exceed $5.50. in addition, at the effective time: (i) bil will purchase for cash additional shares of graham-field common stock having a value (determined as set forth in the merger agreement) equal to the outstanding principal and interest on e&j's indebtedness to hong kong and shanghai banking corporation limited (subject to a cap of $25 million), which indebtedness (the "hsbc indebtedness") is currently guaranteed by bil. the proceeds of such stock purchase will be contributed by graham-field to e&j immediately following the merger and used to discharge the hsbc indebtedness. (ii) graham-field will issue up to $61 million stated value of a new series b cumulative convertible preferred stock (the "series b preferred stock") to bil in exchange for certain indebtedness of e&j owing to bil and shares of e&j preferred stock owned by bil. the series b preferred stock will be entitled to a dividend of 1.5% per annum payable quarterly, will vote on an as-converted basis as a single class with graham-field common stock and the series c preferred stock (as defined in clause (iii) below), will not be subject to redemption and will be convertible (x) at the option of the holder thereof, at a conversion price of $20 per share (or, in the case of certain dividend payment defaults, at a conversion price of $15.50 per share), (y) at the option of graham-field, at a conversion price equal to current trading prices (subject to a 3 minimum conversion price of $15.50 and a maximum conversion price of $20 per share) and (z) automatically on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance at a conversion price of $15.50 per share. such conversion prices are subject to customary antidilution adjustments. a form of the certificate of designations of the series b preferred stock, setting forth the terms thereof, is attached to the merger agreement (exhibit 1 hereto) as exhibit a. (iii) bil will purchase for cash $10 million stated value of a new series c cumulative convertible preferred stock (the "series c preferred stock"), the proceeds of which will be available to graham-field for general corporate purposes. the series c preferred stock will be entitled to a dividend of 1.5% per annum payable quarterly, will vote on an as-converted basis as a single class with graham-field common stock and the series b preferred stock, will be subject to redemption as a whole at the option of graham-field on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance at stated value and, to the extent not so redeemed, will be convertible automatically on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance at a conversion price of $20 per share, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. a form of the certificate of designations of the series c preferred stock, setting forth the terms thereof, is attached to the merger agreement (exhibit 1 hereto) as exhibit b. (iv) certain indebtedness in the amount of $4 million owing by graham-field to bil will be exchanged for an equal amount of unsecured subordinated indebtedness of graham-field maturing on april 1, 2001 and bearing interest at the effective rate of 7.7% per annum. a summary term sheet relating to such subordinated indebtedness is attached to the merger agreement (exhibit 1 hereto) as exhibit c. the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (i) approval of the merger by the holders of e&j capital stock entitled to vote thereon voting at a special meeting of the stockholders of e&j, (ii) approval of the issuance of shares of graham-field common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and certain other matters by the holders of graham-field common stock entitled to vote thereon voting at a special meeting of the stockholders of graham-field, (iii) expiration of certain regulatory waiting periods, (iv) receipt of all required government approvals and (v) declaration of effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the shares of graham- field capital stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement. 4 in connection with the merger, on september 3, 1996, graham-field entered into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement") with bil and irwin selinger, the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of graham- field, pursuant to which, among other things, bil has executed and delivered to graham-field an irrevocable proxy (the "irrevocable proxy") to vote bil's shares of capital stock of e&j (the "bil shares") in favor of approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement and all transactions contemplated thereby, at a special meeting of e&j stockholders. accordingly, the merger will be approved at the e&j special stockholders meeting without the affirmative vote of any other e&j stockholder. bil also agreed, until the effective time, not to dispose of any of the bil shares or any interest therein, exercise any right of conversion with respect to such shares, deposit any of such shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy with respect thereto or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect disposition of such shares. in addition, bil agreed pursuant to the stockholder agreement not to initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries with respect to any alternative business combination transaction relating to e&j or engage in any negotiations concerning any such transaction. bil also agreed to promptly notify graham-field of any inquiries or proposed negotiations with respect to any such proposed transaction. bil has also agreed in the stockholder agreement to grant to graham- field a right of first refusal with respect to certain sales of graham-field securities acquired by bil pursuant to the merger agreement, to indemnify graham-field against certain existing actions and proceedings to which e&j and its subsidiaries are parties, and so long as bil owns securities representing at least 5% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of graham-field, not to acquire additional shares of graham-field common stock without the consent of the board of directors of graham-field (the "graham-field board"), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, seek to acquire ownership of graham-field, engage in any solicitation of proxies with respect to graham- field, or otherwise seek or propose to acquire control of the graham-field board. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, bil will have the right to designate two members of the graham-field board (subject to reduction if bil reduces its ownership of graham-field common stock), and will have the right to participate on a pro rata basis in certain future stock issuances by graham- field. the stockholder agreement will automatically terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or upon a change of control of the graham-field board. in addition, if any person becomes the owner of securities representing more than 15% but less than 100% of the voting power 5 of the outstanding capital stock of graham-field with the approval of the graham-field board and the restrictions imposed by graham-field on the activities of such person are less onerous than those imposed on bil, then the stockholder agreement will be revised to provide for comparable restrictions. a copy of the stockholder agreement is filed as exhibit 2 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. a copy of the irrevocable proxy is filed as exhibit 3 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. except as set forth in this item, the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement, none of the reporting persons has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.
