("trinad"), occurred on february 12, 2007. at the closing, pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement, the company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of new motion (the "interests") from the stockholders, and the stockholders contributed all of their interests to the company. in exchange for the interests, the company issued to the stockholders 500,000 shares ("series c preferred shares") of its series c convertible preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "series c preferred stock"), which will be convertible into that number of shares ("conversion shares") of the company's common stock, equal to 9,000,000, less the number of shares of common stock (on a post-reverse split (as hereinafter defined) basis) issuable upon the exercise of all new motion options and warrants following their assumption by the company. of these shares, europlay received 50,000 shares of series c preferred stock, which shall be convertible into 217,910,640 shares of common stock, in exchange for its interests in new motion. each share of series c preferred stock is convertible into approximately 4358.21 shares of the company's common stock (the "conversion rate"). the company intends to amend its restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to provide for an increase in its authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 100,000,000 and a 1-for-300 reverse stock split (the "reverse split"). the series c preferred stock will immediately and automatically be converted into shares of common stock (the "mandatory conversion") upon the approval by holders of a majority of the company's common stock (voting together on an as-converted-to-common-stock basis) of this amendment. upon the effectiveness of such amendment, the company will have a sufficient number of authorized but un-issued and un-reserved shares of common stock to allow for the full conversion of all of the outstanding shares of series c preferred stock and all other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. 3 the company anticipates that it will be able to obtain the requisite vote from its stockholders to facilitate the amendment of its restated certificate of incorporation, as amended. the amendment to the company's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, was approved by the board of directors of the company on february 13, 2007. if approved, upon the effectiveness of the reverse split, the conversion rate will be adjusted downward to account for the reverse split. the beneficial ownership of the company's common stock reported in this schedule 13d by europlay is based on europlay's ownership of 50,000 shares of the company's series c preferred stock, on an as converted basis prior to the proposed reverse split and assumes a total of 3,004,106,500 shares of the company's common stock outstanding as of february 12, 2007, on a pre-reverse split basis. effective as of the closing, europlay, raymond musci ("musci"), scott walker ("walker") mplc holdings, llc ("mplc holdings") and trinad agreed to vote their shares of the company's common stock (voting together on an as-converted-to-common-stock basis) to (i) elect robert s. ellin or such other person designated by trinad from time to time (the "trinad designate") to the company's board for a period of one year following the closing, and (ii) approve the increase in the authorized shares of common stock which the company shall have the authority to issue, the reverse split, a corporate name change, and a stock incentive plan (clause (ii) is referred to herein as the "actions"). the voting agreement, dated february 12, 2007, by and among europlay, musci, walker, mplc holdings and trinad is attached hereto as exhibit 1, and incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction. reference is made to the disclosure set forth under item 3 of this schedule 13d, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. all of the 217,910,640 shares of common stock to which this schedule 13d relates are held by europlay as an investment. europlay disclaims any membership in a group relating to the company except with respect to the actions described above to which europlay, musci, walker, mplc holdings and trinad have agreed to vote. as a result of the closing, europlay owns 7.3% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the company's capital stock. on february 13, 2007, the board of directors authorized the actions, and resolved to present to the stockholders of the corporation the proposed actions for their approval. the company anticipates that it will be able to obtain the requisite vote from its stockholders to facilitate the actions. these actions will cause the mandatory conversion. subject to the approval of the company's stockholders to effect the reverse split, upon the mandatory conversion (assuming no exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities), and subject to an adjustment of the conversion rate as a result of the reverse split, the holders of the company's capital stock will hold the following number of shares representing the following percentage of its outstanding common stock: the holders of series c preferred stock will, in the aggregate, own approximately 7,263,688 shares of common stock, representing approximately 72.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock; the existing holders of common stock will own approximately 250,000 shares of common stock representing approximately 2.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock; the existing holder of series a preferred stock will own approximately 1,200,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 12% of the outstanding shares of common stock; and the existing holders of series b preferred stock will own approximately 1,300,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 13% of the outstanding shares of common stock. the shares of common stock received in the reverse split will be subject to round up for fractional shares. 4 other than as described in this schedule 13d, europlay, and joseph miller as a managing director of europlay, do not have any plans or
