(c) if a non-appealable judgment is rendered against any indemnitee in any action covered by the indemnification hereunder, or any lien attaches to any of the assets of any of the indemnitee, the indemnitor shall immediately upon such entry or attachment pay such judgment in full or discharge such lien unless, at the expense and direction of the indemnitor, an appeal is taken under which the execution of the judgment or satisfaction of the lien is stayed. if and when a final judgment is rendered in any such action, the indemnitor shall forthwith pay such judgment or discharge such lien before any indemnitee is compelled to do so. 9.4. waiver. the failure of any indemnitee to give any notice or to take any action hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the rights of such indemnitee hereunder, except to the extent that indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such failure. 10. termination. 10.1. termination. this agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the closing: (a) by mutual consent of buyer and the company; or (b) at the election of buyer if: (i) a company has breached or failed to perform or comply with any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this agreement; or (ii) any of the conditions precedent set forth in section 6 or 7 is not satisfied as and when required by 19 this agreement; or (iii) the closing has not been consummated by march 31, 2001; or (c) at the election of the company if: (i) buyer has breached or failed to perform or comply with any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this agreement; or (ii) any of the conditions precedent set forth in section 6 or 8 is not satisfied as and when required by this agreement; or (iii) if the closing has not been consummated by march 31, 2001. 10.2. manner and effect of termination. written notice of any termination ("termination notice") pursuant to this section 10 shall be given by the party electing termination of this agreement ("terminating party") to the other party or parties (collectively, the "terminated party"), and such notice shall state the reason for termination. the party or parties receiving termination notice shall have a period of ten (10) days after receipt of termination notice to cure the matters giving rise to such termination to the reasonable satisfaction of the terminating party. if the matters giving rise to termination are not cured as required hereby, this agreement shall be terminated effective as of the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the terminated party's receipt of termination notice. upon termination of this agreement prior to the consummation of the closing and in accordance with the terms hereof, this agreement shall become void and of no effect, and none of the parties shall have any liability to the others, except that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from: (a) its obligations under sections 2.3 and 2.4; or (b) liability for its intentional breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, or its intentional failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement or to perform its obligations hereunder. 20 11. miscellaneous. 11.1. notices.
