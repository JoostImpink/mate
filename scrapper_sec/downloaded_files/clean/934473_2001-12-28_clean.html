(a) underwriting arrangements. the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this section 2.3 in connection with an underwritten offering shall be conditioned upon the participation by such holder in the underwriting arrangements specified by the company in connection with such registration and the inclusion of the registrable securities of such holder in such underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their registrable securities through such underwriting shall (together with the company) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter; provided, however, that none of the holders shall be required to make any representations or warranties or provide indemnification except as it relates to such holder's registrable securities, including such holder's ownership of shares and authority to enter into the underwriting agreement and to such holder's intended method of distribution, and the liability of such holder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder, except in the case of fraud. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2.3, if the managing underwriter determines in good faith that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten the managing underwriter may limit the total number of registrable securities to be included in such registration to the extent set forth below. the company shall so advise all holders distributing registrable securities through such underwriting, and there shall be included in such registration and underwriting, first shares offered by the company, then shares offered by any existing stockholder of the company having 5 registration rights senior to the holders as of the date of this agreement and thereafter shares offered by the holders on a pro-rata basis.

(i) notwithstanding the above, the company may suspend the effectiveness of the shelf registration, suspend the use of any prospectus included therein ("prospectus") and shall not be required to amend or supplement the shelf registration, any related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference for a period of time not to exceed 60 consecutive days and in no event to exceed more than an aggregate of 90 days during any 12-month period (the "pending event suspension period"), if an event or circumstance occurs and is continuing that (a) has not been publicly disclosed and, if not disclosed in the shelf registration, any related prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference as then amended or supplemented would, in the company's good faith reasonable judgment, result in the shelf registration, any related prospectus or any such document containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (b) in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company (the "board"), after consultation with its outside securities counsel, the company has a bona fide business purpose for not then disclosing the existence of such event or circumstance; provided, further, that the effectiveness period shall be extended by the number of days in any pending event suspension period occurring during the effectiveness period, and such period and any extension thereof is hereinafter referred to as the "effectiveness period." in the event of the occurrence of any pending event suspension period, the company will promptly notify the holders in writing. the company will also provide 6 written notice to the holders of the end of each pending event suspension period. each holder agrees to cease all public disposition efforts under any registration statement with respect to the common stock held by such holder immediately upon receipt of notice of the beginning of any pending event suspension period and until the holder receives notice of the end of such pending event suspension period.

(b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for the period set forth in 7 paragraph (a) above including such amendments as may be necessary for the holders to sell their registrable shares in an underwritten offering.

(f) notify each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. each investor agrees to cease all public disposition efforts under any registration statement with respect to the common stock held by such investor immediately upon receipt of such notice and until the investor receives notice that such deficiency has been cured. (g) request that (i) counsel representing the company for the purposes of such registration furnish to the holders, on the date that such registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, an opinion, dated as of such date, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) the company's auditors furnish to the holders, a letter dated as of such date, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering addressed to the underwriters.

(i) following the effective date of the shelf registration, issue to transferees of the holders which are limited partners of the holders, certificates representing the shares that will 8 be free of any restrictive legends if, and to the extent, such transferees execute a representation letter reasonably acceptable to the company with respect to compliance with federal and state securities laws. 2.6 furnishing information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to section 2.2 or 2.3 that the selling holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities and such other information as shall be required to effect the registration of their registrable securities. 2.7 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under sections 2.2 or 2.3: (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder and the partners, officers, directors and stockholders of each holder, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation") by the company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the company will pay as incurred to each such holder, partner, officer, director, stockholder, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action (subject to recoupment if this indemnification is determined to be inapplicable); provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs (i) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such holder, partner, officer, director, stockholder, underwriter or controlling person of such holder or (ii) pursuant to such holder's use of an outdated or defective prospectus after the company has notified such holder that the prospectus is outdated or defective. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the 9 company, each of its directors, officers, agents, employees and its legal counsel and independent accountants, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other holder's partners, directors, officers, agents, employees, stockholders, legal counsel and independent accountants, or any person who controls such holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the company or any such person may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder under an instrument duly executed by such holder and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration statement; and each such holder will pay as incurred any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this section 2.7(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 2.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, if such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding; provided further, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 2.7, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 2.7. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party 10 on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (e) the obligations of the company and holders under this section 2.7 shall survive completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement and the termination of this agreement. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 2.8 assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities and to provide indemnification pursuant to this section 2 may be assigned by a holder to a transferee or assignee of registrable securities which (a) is a subsidiary, parent, general partner, limited partner, retired partner, member, retired member or affiliate of a holder, (b) is a holder's immediate family member or trust for the benefit of an individual holder or immediate family members or (c) acquires at least 50,000 shares of registrable securities (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations and similar events); provided, however, (i) the transferor shall, within ten (10) days after such transfer, furnish to the company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee shall agree to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this agreement by executing a counterpart signature page hereto (which shall not be deemed to be an amendment hereto). 2.9 amendment of registration rights. any provision of this section 2 may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the company and the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding. any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this section 2.9 shall be binding upon each holder and the company. by acceptance of any benefits under this section 2, holders of registrable securities hereby agree to be bound by the provisions hereunder. 2.10 limitation on subsequent registration rights. after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company that would grant such holder registration rights senior to those granted to the holders hereunder. 11 2.11 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in sec rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the securities act; (b) file with the sec, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the company under the exchange act; and (c) so long as a holder owns any registrable securities, furnish to such holder forthwith upon request: a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144 of the securities act, and of the exchange act; a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company; and such other reports and documents as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing it to sell any such securities without registration. section 3 covenants of the company 3.1 inspection rights. each holder shall have the right to visit and inspect any of the properties of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the company or any of its subsidiaries with its officers, and to review such information as is reasonably requested all during normal business hours following reasonable notice and as often as may be reasonably requested;
