(2) a tender offer or exchange offer by pepsico or its affiliates for all voting securities of whitman not beneficially owned by pepsico and its affiliates at a price not less than the minimum price calculated as set forth in the pepsico shareholder agreement. page 9 of 15 pages (3) any merger or business combination approved by whitman shareholders excluding pepsico and its affiliates. (4) a transaction approved by a majority of directors who are independent of pepsico and robert c. pohlad and their respective affiliates. (5) an acquisition of voting securities of whitman by robert c. pohlad, his affiliates or his family approved by the affiliated transaction committee of the whitman board (or if such committee is not in existence, by a committee of the whitman board composed entirely of independent directors). for purposes of the pepsico shareholder agreement, independent directors are directors unaffiliated with pepsico and its affiliates, or with robert c. pohlad, his affiliates and his family, and who are not officers, employees, consultants or advisors to whitman and have not been within the past two years. the minimum price referred to above in clause (2) is the highest average of whitman closing prices on the nyse over any 20 consecutive day period during the 18 months preceding the announcement of the offer or business combination in question. the pepsico shareholder agreement provides that pepsico and its affiliates will not take any of the following actions without the prior approval of a majority of the independent directors: (1) acquire, propose to acquire, disclose an intention to acquire, or offer or agree to acquire beneficial ownership of any voting security of whitman which would cause the maximum ownership percentage or combined maximum ownership percentage to be exceeded, other than pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the pepsico shareholder agreement. (2) form, join or in any way participate in a group that would be required to file a statement on schedule 13d as a "person" under section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act with respect to any voting securities of whitman or its subsidiaries if such group's ownership of whitman voting securities would exceed the maximum ownership percentage. (3) initiate a merger, acquisition or other business combination transaction relating to whitman, other than a combination of a party unaffiliated with pepsico with whitman that would not be a permitted acquisition under the pepsico shareholder agreement. in addition, if at any time pepsico becomes aware that the ownership of pepsico and its affiliates exceeds the maximum ownership percentage, except as specifically permitted under the pepsico shareholder agreement, pepsico and its affiliates will promptly take all action necessary to reduce the amount of voting securities of whitman beneficially owned by them so that they are below the maximum ownership percentage. if at any time pepsico becomes aware that the combined maximum ownership percentage has been exceeded as a result of a reduction in the number of voting securities outstanding, pepsico and its affiliates will take specified actions to reduce their ownership, though, in taking certain actions, the reduction need only be pro rata based on the relative ownership of pepsico and its affiliates, on the one hand, and robert c. pohlad, his affiliates and his family, on the other hand. if at any time pepsico becomes aware that the combined maximum ownership percentage has been exceeded (other than as a result of a reduction in the number of voting securities outstanding), pepsico and its affiliates will promptly take actions to reduce the amount of voting securities of whitman beneficially owned by them so that the combined maximum ownership percentage is not exceeded, though, if the reason that the combined maximum ownership percentage has been exceeded is due to an acquisition of voting securities by robert c. pohlad, his affiliates or his family, pepsico and its affiliates will not be required to reduce their ownership percentage. page 10 of 15 pages while the pepsico shareholder agreement is in effect, none of pepsico or its affiliates will, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement or commitment with robert c. pohlad, any of his affiliates or any member of his family with respect to the holding, voting, acquisition or disposition of voting securities of whitman. the foregoing prohibition specifically excludes the llc agreement so long as (1) such llc agreement provides that pepsico and its affiliates ultimately have sole power with respect to the voting of a certain percentage of voting securities of whitman held by the llc and have no power with respect to the voting of the remainder of the voting securities of whitman held by the llc and (2) the llc takes no action to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional voting securities of whitman except as permitted by the pepsico shareholder agreement. pepsico and its affiliates may transfer any of their voting securities of whitman to any transferee without restriction except for significant transferees who would own 20% or more of whitman voting securities after the transfer. pepsico and its affiliates may effect a transfer to a significant transferee with the prior written consent of a majority of the independent directors. however, pepsico and its affiliates may transfer voting securities of whitman to any significant transferee without restriction and without obtaining such consent if, at the time of the transfer, pepsico and its affiliates beneficially own at least 20% of the outstanding voting securities of such significant transferee and no other person beneficially owns a greater percentage of such significant transferee than pepsico and its affiliates. pepsico and its affiliates would need to obtain the prior written consent of a majority of the independent directors of whitman to transfer any voting securities of the significant transferee if, at the time of that transfer, such significant transferee owns greater than 20% of whitman voting securities and that transfer would result in pepsico and its affiliates beneficially owning less than 20% of the voting securities of such significant transferee or any other person beneficially owning a greater percentage of such significant transferee than pepsico and its affiliates. none of the foregoing restrictions will apply to (1) a transfer of whitman voting securities by pepsico or any of its affiliates in a public offering where reasonable efforts are made to achieve a wide distribution of such voting securities, (2) a liquidation of the llc or other distribution of its assets to its members in proportion to their capital accounts or (3) a transfer of voting securities of whitman among pepsico and its affiliates, provided that any such transferee agrees in writing prior to each such transfer to be bound by the terms of the pepsico shareholder agreement. the pepsico shareholder agreement took effect immediately upon the closing of the merger and will remain in effect until the earliest to occur of: (1) the date on which pepsico and its affiliates' ownership of whitman voting securities falls below 15%. (2) subject to the provisions described in the following paragraph, the date on which a permitted acquisition is consummated which results in pepsico and its affiliates, together with robert c. pohlad, his affiliates and his family, beneficially owning 75% or more of the voting power of whitman. (3) two years from the first date on which the following two conditions are met: (a) pepsico and its affiliates, together with robert c. pohlad, his affiliates and his family, beneficially own more than 55% but less than 75% of the voting power of whitman and (b) pepsico and its affiliates have consummated a tender offer or exchange offer for whitman securities at a price not less than the minimum price, as defined in the pepsico shareholder agreement, pursuant to which at least 10% of the voting power of whitman not beneficially owned prior to such offer by pepsico and its affiliates, or robert c. pohlad, his affiliates or his family, was acquired.
