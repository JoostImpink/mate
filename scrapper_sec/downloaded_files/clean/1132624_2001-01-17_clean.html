between the company and diligenti, inc., diligenti, inc. agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to invest a total of $5,000,000 in the company. on september 21, 2000 diligenti, inc. made a convertible secured bridge loan of $3,750,000 to the company (the "bridge loan"). the bridge loan bore interest at a rate of 20% per annum payable at maturity. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, diligenti, inc. had the right at any time to convert a portion of the principal amount of the bridge loan into a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately 38% of the outstanding capital stock of the company on the relevant date of conversion. diligenti, inc. further agreed that upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, the outstanding principal amount of the bridge loan would automatically convert into newly issued shares of common stock so that, together with any previously issued shares of common stock, diligenti, inc. would hold an aggregate number of shares of newly issued common stock equal to 38% of the company's outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis on such date. upon receipt of such shares of common stock, diligenti, inc. would cancel all of the company's obligations with respect to the bridge loan, including the obligation to pay any accrued and unpaid interest, and would invest an additional $1,250,000 (the "additional investment") to acquire a number of newly issued shares of common stock equal to 13% of the company's outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issue. following the conversion of the bridge loan and the making of the additional investment by diligenti, inc., diligenti, inc. would hold an aggregate number of shares of common stock equal to 51% of the company's outstanding capital stock as of the date of conversion on a fully diluted basis. the agreement also provided that if the conditions precedent to the conversion of the bridge loan were not met prior to december 31, 2000, then the bridge loan would mature on march 31, 2001. in addition, in consideration for the bridge loan, diligenti, inc. was given the right under the agreement to appoint two members to the five person board of directors of the company. diligenti, inc. appointed neil stafford and christopher spanoudakis to the company's board of directors and thomas m. hartnett, a senior vice president of the company, resigned from the board, though he has retained his executive position. the proceeds of the bridge loan were used by the company to finance the acquisition of the preventive services division ("psd") of u.s. healthworks, inc., to repay certain indebtedness and to fund the company's operations. on november 3, 2000, all of the conditions precedent set forth in the agreement to the issuance by the company of a number of shares of common stock equal to 38% of the company's outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis had been met and diligenti, inc., page 5 of 10 pages 6 following receipt of such shares of common stock, in accordance with the agreement, cancelled all of the company's obligations with respect to the bridge loan, including any obligation to pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and made the additional investment, for which diligenti, inc. received a number of newly issued shares of common stock equal to 13% of the

diligenti, inc. owned a total of 24,900,280 shares of common stock (the "subject shares") which constituted approximately 62.7% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company on such date (based on the number of shares of common stock represented to be issued and outstanding as of november 3, 2000) but constituted approximately 51% of the capital stock of the company on a fully diluted basis, taking into account the outstanding warrants and options to acquire shares of common stock held by third parties as of that date. the average price per share paid by diligenti, inc. for the shares of common stock was $0.2008. while diligenti, inc.'s investment in the company pursuant to the agreement helped to address the company's immediate working capital needs, additional funding is still required to sustain the company's operations, settle certain past due accounts payable and fund the continued growth of its core business. to address these needs, diligenti limited, which owns all the outstanding capital stock of diligenti, inc. is in the final stage of negotiations with the company to provide a further $5,000,000 of funding in the form of another convertible secured bridge loan. should diligenti limited agree to provide this additional facility to the company, the funds made available thereunder would allow the company to settle certain past debts as well as normalize working capital. in addition, the facility would fund projected future growth as well as allow the company to complete the integration of psd. the preceding summaries of certain provisions of the
