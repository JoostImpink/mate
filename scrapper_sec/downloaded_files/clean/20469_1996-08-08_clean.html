(collectively, the "michiana shareholders"), the company was granted an option to acquire michiana news services, inc. ("michiana") generally pursuant to the terms set forth in the michiana option agreement. pursuant to the michiana option agreement, the company has entered into negotiations with michiana and the - 7 - 7 michiana shareholders. effective july 30, 1996, the company entered into a stock transfer and exchange agreement with the shareholders of michiana pursuant to which the michiana shareholders are to transfer all of the outstanding shares of capital stock in michiana to the company in exchange for common shares, without par value, of the company and senior and subordinated debentures of the company. the stock transfer and exchange agreement is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by the shareholders of the company and consummation of the transactions with stoll and the scherer affiliates described below. due to these conditions, there can be no assurance that the transaction with michiana will be completed. pursuant to an option agreement dated march 1, 1996 (the "stoll option agreement"), between the company and the stoll companies, the company was granted an option to acquire the stoll companies ("stoll") generally pursuant to the terms set forth in the stoll option agreement. pursuant to the stoll option agreement, the company entered into negotiations with stoll and its shareholders (the "stoll shareholders"). effective july 31, 1996, the company entered into a stock transfer and exchange agreement with the principal shareholders of stoll. pursuant to the agreement, the stoll shareholders are to transfer all of the outstanding shares of capital stock in stoll to the company in exchange for common shares, without par value, of the company and senior and subordinated debentures of the company. the agreement needs to be signed by the remaining stoll shareholders and is subject to a number of other conditions, including approval by the shareholders of the company and consummation of the transactions with michiana described above and with the scherer affiliates described below. due to these conditions, there can be no assurance that the transaction with stoll will be completed. pursuant to an option agreement dated march 1, 1996 (the "option agreement"), between the company and linda (scherer) talbott individually and on behalf of the shareholders of ohio periodical distributors, inc.

(collectively, "northern"), the company was granted an option to acquire, at the option of the seller, all or substantially all of the wholesale periodical distribution assets and assume all or substantially all of the wholesale periodical distribution liabilities of opd and northern, generally pursuant to the terms set forth in the option agreement. opd, macgregor, northern, and the scherer companies, are companies affiliated with ronald e. scherer, senior chairman of the company (collectively, the "scherer affiliates"). the company has entered into negotiations with the scherer affiliates and their shareholders (the "scherer shareholders"). the company is continuing to negotiate with the scherer affiliates and has not yet entered into definitive agreements with them. the company has filed with the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 for approval of the acquisition of opd, and that application is still pending. as a result of the transactions described in this paragraph, ronald e. scherer would acquire additional common shares of the company. however, when combined with the transactions to be entered into with stoll and michiana, his percentage interest in the company is expected to decrease. there can -
