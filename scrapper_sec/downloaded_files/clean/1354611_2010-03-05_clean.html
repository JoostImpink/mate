(b) upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, all rights of the pledgor to dividends, interest and principal that which the pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to clause (a)(iii) of this section 4 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the pledgee, who shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest and principal payments. all dividends, interest and principal payments which are received by the pledgor contrary to the provisions of this section 4(b) shall be held in trust for the benefit of the pledgee, shall be segregated from other property or funds of the pledgor and shall be immediately delivered to the pledgee in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the pledgee pursuant to the provisions of this section 4(b) shall be deposited by the pledgee in an account to be established by the pledgee upon receipt of such money or other property and such money or other property and interest thereon shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of section 6. (c) upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, and whether or not the collateral shall have been registered in the name of the pledgee or a nominee or shall remain registered in the name of the pledgor, all rights of the pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers he is entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (a)(i) of this section 4 shall cease, and the pledgee may thereupon fully exercise, to the exclusion of the pledgor, the proxy granted to it in section 4(a). (d) the pledgor hereby authorizes and instructs the issuer, without any other or further instruction from the pledgor, to (i) comply with any written instruction received by it from the pledgee that (x) states that an enforcement event has occurred and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms and provisions of this agreement and (ii) direct payment of any dividends or other payments with respect to the pledged securities directly to the pledgee (except to the extent such dividends or payments are permitted to be received by the pledgor pursuant to the terms hereof). the pledgor hereby agrees and confirms that the issuer shall be fully protected in compliance with this section 4(d). 8 section 5. remedies upon default . upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, whether or not all of the secured obligations shall have become due and payable: (a) the pledgee shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the collateral of a secured party under the ucc and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled at law or in equity in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including without limitation the right, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to exercise all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining to the collateral as if the pledgee were the sole and absolute owner thereof (and the pledgor agrees to take all such action as may be appropriate to give effect to such right). (b) the pledgee in its sole and absolute discretion may, in its name or in the name of the pledgor or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so.

(d) at any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this section 5 , the pledgee may bid for or purchase, free from any right of redemption, stay or appraisal on the part of the pledgor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to it from the pledgor as a credit against the purchase price, and it may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to the pledgor thereof. 9 (e) the pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the securities act, and applicable state securities laws, the pledgee may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. the pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the pledgee than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the pledgee shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any collateral for the period of time necessary to permit registration of such collateral for public sale. (f) the pledgor shall bear all costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations hereunder with respect to the foregoing. the pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for its failure to comply with the foregoing provisions and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements with respect to the foregoing may be specifically enforced. section 6. application of proceeds of sal e.
