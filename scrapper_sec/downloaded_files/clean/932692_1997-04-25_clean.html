tpg and laidlaw are being acquired for investment purposes. the purchasers entered into a shareholders agreement with the issuer, dated as of april 14, 1997 (the "tpg shareholders agreement"), relating to, among other things, (i) certain restrictions during the standstill period (as defined therein; generally lasting until six years after the purchase of the laidlaw shares) on the purchasers' (a) dispositions and acquisitions of voting securities of the issuer except in certain limited circumstances including the opportunity to obtain up to a maximum of 3,000,000 additional shares with the written consent of the two most senior executives of the issuer, (b) the making of any proposals for certain reorganization transactions (as defined therein) and (c) solicitation of shareholders for approval of various shareholder proposals, (ii) the assignment to the purchasers of registration rights held by tpg and (iii) corporate governance matters concerning the issuer. the tpg shareholders agreement provides that upon the closing of the purchasers' acquisition of the tpg shares, (x) the board will consist of no more than 12 directors, unless brian o'leary ceases to serve as a director, in which case the board will consist of no more than 11 directors, (y) the issuer will support the election of two individuals as the purchasers may designate to the board to fill the vacancies resulting from the anticipated resignation from the board of the tpg designees and (z) the issuer's bylaws will be amended to give effect to certain terms of the tpg shareholders agreement concerning the composition of the board and its committees. page 13 of 22 pages pursuant to an amended and restated shareholders agreement dated as of april 21, 1997 (the "amended shareholders agreement"), the purchasers and the issuer have agreed to amend the tpg shareholders agreement, effective upon the purchasers' acquisition of the laidlaw shares, to provide that (i) two designees of the purchasers be elected to the board to fill the vacancies resulting from the anticipated resignation from the board of the laidlaw designees, (ii) during the standstill period, the purchasers will not make dispositions (as defined therein) of voting securities of the issuer prior to the second anniversary of the effective date of the amendment, except in certain limited circumstances, and (iii) during the shareholder designee period (as defined therein), the issuer will support the election to the board of (a) no more than two persons who are executive officers of the issuer, (b)(1) four purchaser designees, so long as purchasers own 75% or more of the shares, (2) three purchaser designees, so long as purchasers own 50% or more but less than 75% of the shares, (3) two purchaser designees so long as shareholders beneficially own 25% or more but less than 50% of the shares and (4) one purchaser designee, so long as purchasers own 20% or more but less than 25% of the shares, provided that if the issuer's issuance of voting securities causes the purchaser to own less than 9% of the actual voting power (as defined therein), purchasers shall be entitled to no more than one designee, and (c) such other persons who are recommended by a majority of the nominating committee and who are unaffiliated directors (as defined therein). subject to a decrease in the number of purchaser designees, the nominating committee will consist of not more than four directors, two of whom will be purchaser designees and two of whom will be management designees or unaffiliated directors. pursuant to the investment agreement, the right to designate director nominees is shared by the blackstone purchasers and the apollo purchasers as follows: if the purchasers collectively are entitled to designate four nominees, then three shall be designees of the apollo purchasers and one shall be a designee of the blackstone purchasers; if the purchasers collectively are entitled to designate three nominees, then two shall be designees of the apollo purchasers and one shall be a designee of the page 14 of 22 pages blackstone purchasers; if the purchasers collectively are entitled to designate two nominees, then one shall be a designee of the apollo purchasers and one shall be a designee of the blackstone purchasers; and if the purchasers collectively are entitled to designate one nominee, such nominee shall be a designee of the apollo purchasers. a corresponding allocation mechanism applies with respect to the representation of the purchasers' designated directors on board committees of the issuer. the purchasers have agreed to vote all shares of common stock held by them in favor of the director designees proposed pursuant to the above formula. the investment agreement also provides that, as a general rule, neither the blackstone purchasers nor the apollo purchasers may transfer shares unless notice is first given to the other (the "offeree"), whereupon the offeree would have a 15 day exclusive right to negotiate to purchase the offered shares. if the offeree does not purchase such shares within such period, the relevant purchaser may freely sell such shares, subject to the restrictions of the shareholders agreement. finally, the investment agreement provides that if opportunities become available to the purchasers to acquire additional shares of common stock, the purchasers shall all have the right to participate in such acquisitions in the relative proportions set forth in the investment agreement. the amended shareholders agreement also provides that the issuer's bylaws will be amended to give effect to certain terms of the amended shareholders agreement concerning the board of directors and its committees. the purchasers and the company have also entered into an agreement, dated as of april 21, 1997 (the "interim agreement"), concerning certain governance matters and the suspension of the purchasers' registration rights during the period prior to the issuer's 1997 annual meeting of shareholders. the interim agreement also provides that the issuer will not fill any of the vacancies created by the director resignations provided for in the purchase agreements other than in accordance with the tpg shareholders agreement and the amended shareholders agreement. page 15 of 22 pages pursuant to a registration rights agreement, dated as of april 21, 1997 (the "registration rights agreement"), between the purchasers and the company, the company granted to the purchasers certain registration rights with respect to common stock to be owned by the purchasers. upon the purchasers' acquisition of the laidlaw shares, the rights granted under the registration rights agreement will supersede all other registration rights held by the purchasers with respect to the common stock. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the purchasers have the right, at any time after two years following the purchase of the laidlaw shares, to demand that a registration statement be filed and become effective with respect to not less than 5,000,000 shares proposed to be sold by the purchasers in a registered public offering. this demand registration right may be exercised up to three times. the registration rights agreement also provides the purchasers with incidental registration rights exercisable after two years following the purchase of the laidlaw shares. in addition, pursuant to the shareholders agreement, the purchasers agreed to vote all voting securities owned by them or their affiliates in favor of the directors nominated in accordance with the provisions of the shareholders agreement and to vote in connection with any proposed reorganization transaction in the manner recommended by a majority of the board of directors of the issuer. except as described above, at the present time the reporting persons do not have any plans or proposals that would relate to any transaction, change or event specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of the schedule 13d form. subject to the restrictions set forth in the investment agreement, the tpg shareholders agreement and the amended shareholders agreement, the blackstone entities retain the right to make additional purchases of common stock, change their investment intent, to propose one or more possible transactions to the issuer and/or other stockholders with the consent of the page 16 of 22 pages issuer and/or the apollo entities. all references to and summaries of the tpg shareholders agreement, the amended shareholders agreement, the interim agreement and the registration rights agreement in this schedule 13d are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, the full texts of which are filed as exhibits 5, 6, 7 and 8 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by this reference. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer the blackstone purchasers and the apollo purchasers acted in concert in agreeing to acquire the shares, and pursuant to the shareholders agreement and the investment agreement their ability to vote and dispose of such shares is subject to the requirements described therein. consequently, the blackstone purchasers and the apollo purchasers may be deemed to constitute a "group" for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act. by virtue of the arrangements described above, the purchasers may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power with respect to the 26,376,765 shares of common stock being acquired from tpg and laidlaw, which constitutes approximately 34.4% of the issuer's issued and outstanding common stock. in accordance with the investment agreement, the blackstone purchasers collectively have agreed to acquire 9,231,868 shares of common stock, which constitutes approximately 12.1% of the issuer's issued and outstanding shares. each of the reporting persons and the apollo entities disclaim any pecuniary interest in the shares of common stock held by the other. bcp ii, bocp ii and bfip ii, acting through their sole general partner bma ii, have the sole power to vote or to direct the vote, and to dispose or to direct the disposition of, the shares of common stock respectively owned by them. as a result, bma ii may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of common stock directly owned by the respective blackstone purchasers of which it is the general partner. the founding members of bma ii have shared power to vote or to direct the vote of, and to dispose or to direct the disposition of, the shares of common stock that may be deemed to be page 17 of 22 pages beneficially owned by bma ii. as a result, each of such founding members may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of common stock that bma ii may be deemed to beneficially own. to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, neither bcp ii, bocp ii, bma ii nor any of the members has

relationship between shareholders and the company, shareholders and the company have agreed to enter into this agreement. now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: article i definitions 1.1. certain definitions. in this agreement: "exchange act" means the united states securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the sec promulgated under such act. "registrable securities" means the shares and any additional shares of common stock acquired by shareholders in compliance with the shareholders agreement, and any shares of common stock issued in connection with any stock dividend on, or any stock split, reclassification or reorganization of shares or such additional shares of common stock. "sec" means the united states securities and exchange commission or any successor agency. "securities act" means the united states securities act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the sec promulgated under such act. -2- article ii registration rights 2.1. incidental rights. if at any time or from time to time after two years following the date of the closing of the purchase of the laidlaw block, company proposes to file with the sec a registration statement (whether on form s-1, s-2, or s-3, or any equivalent form then in effect) for the registration under the securities act of any shares of common stock for sale, for cash consideration, to the public by company or on behalf of one or more shareholders of company (excluding any sale of securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, and any shares of common stock issuable by company upon the exercise of employee stock options, or to any employee stock ownership plan, or in connection with any acquisition made by company, any securities exchange offer, dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plan, corporate reorganization, or in connection with any amalgamation, merger or consolidation of company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of company with one or more other corporations if company is the surviving corporation), company shall give shareholders at least 20 days' prior written notice of the proposed filing (or if 20 days' notice is not practicable, a reasonable shorter period to be not less than 7 days), which notice shall outline the nature of the proposed distribution and the jurisdictions in the united states in which company proposes to qualify and offer such securities (the "elected jurisdictions"). on the written request of shareholders received by company within 15 days after the date of company's delivery to shareholders of the notice of intended registration (which request shall specify the registrable securities sought to be disposed of by shareholders and the intended method or methods by which dispositions are intended to be made), company shall, under the terms and subject to the conditions of this article ii, at its own expense as provided in section 4.1, include in the coverage of such registration statement (or in a separate registration statement concurrently filed) and -3- qualify for sale under the blue sky or securities laws of the various states in the elected jurisdictions the number of registrable securities (the "specified securities") held by shareholders and which shareholders have so requested to be registered or qualified for distribution, to the extent requisite to permit the distribution (in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof as aforesaid) in the elected jurisdictions requested by shareholders of such registrable securities. if the distribution proposed to be effected by company involves an underwritten offering of the securities being so distributed by or through one or more underwriters, and if the managing underwriter of such underwritten offering indicates in writing its reasonable belief that including all or part of the specified securities in the coverage of such registration statement or in the distribution to be effected by such prospectus will materially and adversely affect the sale of securities proposed to be sold (which statement of the managing underwriter shall also state the maximum number of shares, if any, which can be sold by shareholders requesting registration under this section 2.1 without materially adversely affecting the sale of the shares proposed to be sold), then the number of specified securities which shareholders shall have the right to include in such registration statement shall be reduced to the maximum number of shares specified by the managing underwriter. in all cases, priority shall be afforded to securities covered by a registration statement filed in response to the exercise of a demand registration right by another holder of common stock and no securities proposed to be sold by such other holder shall be so reduced until all securities proposed to be sold by all other parties have been entirely eliminated. as to all other proposed selling shareholders of common stock, including shareholders, any such reduction in the number of shares of common stock proposed to be sold by the selling shareholders shall be effected on a pro rata basis in accordance with the relationship which the number of shares of common -4- stock proposed to be sold by each selling shareholder bears to the number of shares of common stock proposed to be sold by all selling shareholders. company shall have the sole right to select any underwriters, including the managing underwriter, of any public offering of shares of common stock subject to this section 2.1. nothing in this section 2.1 shall create any liability on the part of company to shareholders if company for any reason decides not to file or to delay or withdraw a registration statement (which company may do in its sole discretion). shareholders may request to have common stock included in an unlimited number of registrations under this section 2.1. 2.2. demand rights. upon written request of shareholders made at any time after two years following the date of the closing of the purchase of the laidlaw block, company shall, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this section 2.2, and sections 2.3 and 2.4, file (and use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective) a registration statement covering, and use its reasonable efforts to qualify for sale under the blue sky or securities laws of the various states of the united states as may be requested by shareholders (except any such state in which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter of the offering, the failure to so qualify would not materially and adversely affect the proposed offering), in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition set forth in that notice, of such number of registrable securities, as may be designated by shareholders in their request, or that portion thereof designated in said request for registration in each of the designated jurisdictions (as defined below). a request for registration under this section 2.2 shall specify the number of shares to be registered, the jurisdictions in the united states in which such registration is to be effected (the "designated jurisdictions") and the proposed manner of sale, including the name and address of any proposed underwriter; provided, that all offerings -5- contemplated by a request for registration under this section 2.2 shall be underwritten offerings involving a distribution of registrable shares to the public in which reasonable efforts are made not to knowingly sell to any single buyer, acting individually or with others, who after such underwriting will own more than 9% of the total voting power (as defined in the shareholders agreement) (any such buyer, "significant stockholder"), under circumstances in which it would reasonably be expected to not result in any person becoming significant stockholder. the principal underwriter or underwriters for any such offering shall be selected by shareholders, subject to company's approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld. notwithstanding any other provision in this section, shareholders shall not be permitted to make a demand for registration pursuant to this section unless the number of registrable securities covered by such demand is at least five million shares (as such number may be appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, reverse stock splits, dividends and any other recapitalization or reorganization of company). if the distribution proposed to be effected pursuant to this section 2.2 involves an underwritten offering of registrable securities and securities of the company other than registrable securities ("other securities"), and if the managing underwriter of such underwritten offering indicates in writing its reasonable belief that including all or part of such securities in the coverage of such registration statement will materially and adversely affect the sale of the securities proposed to be sold, then the number of securities proposed to be sold shall be reduced to the maximum number of securities specified by the managing underwriter. in such a case, priority shall be afforded to registrable securities, and such other securities shall be completely eliminated before the number of registrable securities is reduced. company may delay the filing of any registration statement requested under this section 2.2, or delay its effectiveness, for a reasonable period (but not longer than 90 -6- days) if, in the sole judgment of company's board of directors, (i) a delay is necessary in light of pending financing transactions, corporate reorganizations, or other major events involving company, or (ii) filing at the time requested would materially and adversely affect the business or prospects of company in view of disclosures that may be thereby required. once the cause of the delay is eliminated, company shall promptly notify shareholders and, promptly after shareholders notify company to proceed, company shall file a registration statement and begin performance of its other obligations under this section 2.2. shareholders shall be entitled to request not more than three registrations under this section 2.2 (provided that the filing of a registration statement in more than one designated jurisdiction in connection with a concurrent or substantially concurrent distribution shall be deemed for the purposes of this agreement to be a single registration). however, if shareholders request a registration under this section 2.2, but no registration statement becomes effective with respect to the registrable securities covered by such request, then such request shall not count as a request for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration shareholders may make under this section 2.2. if there is an effective registration statement requested by the shareholders pursuant to this section 2.2, the shareholders may require the company to delay the filing of any registration statement relating to shares of common stock or delay its effectiveness, for a reasonable period (but not longer than 90 days) if, in the sole judgment of the shareholders, a delay is necessary in order to avoid materially and adversely affecting the disposition of shares pursuant to the offering by the shareholders; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the company's right to file and have declared effective registration statements relating to shares of common stock issuable pursuant to employee benefit plans of the company or any of its subsidiaries or issuable pursuant to a -7- merger, acquisition or similar transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries. 2.3. registration conditions. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, company shall not be required to effect a registration of any securities under this article ii, or file any post-effective amendment to such a registration statement relating to such a qualification: (a) unless shareholders agree to (x) sell and distribute a portion or all of their registrable securities in accordance with the plan or plans of distribution adopted by and through underwriters, if any, acting for company or any such other sellers of common stock, and (y) bear a pro rata share of underwriter's discounts and commissions; (b) if a registration requested under section 2.2, or any post- effective amendment to the registration statement filed in connection therewith, requires, under applicable statutes and rules, a special audit (other than a normal fiscal year-end audit) of any financial statements, unless shareholders agree to pay their proportionate share (determined by the number of shares to be sold by shareholders in the offering in proportion to the total number of shares to be sold by company and all other participants in such offering) of the reasonable fees and expenses of accountants incurred in connection with the special audit and which would otherwise not be incurred; provided that shareholders shall not be required to pay any share of such fees and expenses if such audit would otherwise be required at substantially the same time to satisfy the company's reporting requirements under the exchange act absent such registration; (c) if, in the case of a request for registration under section 2.2, (x) any offering pursuant to a registration statement covering securities regarding -8- which shareholders could have exercised registration rights under section 2.1 of this agreement has been completed within the prior 90 days, (y) a registration statement requested by shareholders pursuant to section 2.2 has become effective under the securities act within the prior twelve months, or (z) company has given notice under section 2.1 of its intention to file a registration statement under the securities act and has not completed or abandoned the proposed offering; and (d) unless company has received from shareholders all information company has reasonably requested concerning shareholders and their method of distribution of registrable securities, so as to enable company to include in the registration statement all facts required to be disclosed in it. 2.4. covenants and procedures. if company becomes obligated under this article ii to effect a registration of registrable securities on behalf of shareholders, then (as applicable to the jurisdictions for which such registration is to be made): (a) company, at its expense as provided in section 4.2, shall prepare and file with the sec a registration statement covering such securities and such other related documents as may be necessary or appropriate relating to the proposed distribution, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective. company will also, with respect to any registration statement, file such post-effective amendments to the registration statement (and use reasonable efforts to cause them to become effective) and such supplements as are necessary so that current prospectuses are at all times available for a period of at least 90 days after the effective date of the registration statement or for such longer period, not to exceed 180 days, as may be required under the plan or plans of distribution set forth in the registration statement. shareholders shall promptly provide company with such information with respect to shareholders' registrable -9- securities to be so registered and, if applicable, the proposed terms of their offering, as is required for the registration. if the registrable securities to be covered by the registration statement are not to be sold to or through underwriters acting for company, company shall: (i) deliver to shareholders, as promptly as practicable, as many copies of preliminary prospectuses as shareholders may reasonably request (in which case shareholders shall keep a written record of the distribution of the preliminary prospectuses and shall refrain from delivery of the preliminary prospectuses in any manner or under any circumstances which would violate the securities act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, including the various states of the united states); (ii) deliver to shareholders, as soon as practicable after the effective date of the registration statement, and from time to time thereafter during the applicable period described in section 2.4, as many copies of the relevant prospectuses as shareholders may reasonably request; and (iii) in case of the happening, after the effective date of the registration statement and during the applicable 90 or 180-day period described in the second sentence of section 2.4(a), of any event or occurrence as a result of which the prospectus, as then in effect, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it was made, give shareholders written notice of the event or occurrence and prepare and furnish to shareholders, in such quantities as it may reasonably request, copies of an amendment of or a supplement to such prospectus as may be -10- necessary so that the prospectus, as so amended or supplemented and thereafter delivered to purchasers of the securities, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading. (b) company will notify shareholders of any action by the sec or any commission to suspend the effectiveness of any registration statement filed pursuant hereto or the initiation or threatened initiation of any proceeding for such purpose or the receipt by company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the securities for sale in any jurisdiction. immediately upon receipt of any such notice, shareholders shall cease to offer or sell any registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement or prospectus in the jurisdiction to which such order or suspension relates. company will also notify shareholders promptly of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any state of facts that, in the judgment of company, should be set forth in such registration statement or prospectus. immediately upon receipt of such notice, shareholders shall cease to offer or sell any registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement or prospectus, cease to deliver or use such registration statement or prospectus and, if so requested by company, return to company at company's expense all copies of such registration statement or prospectus. company will as promptly as practicable take such action as may be necessary to amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus in order to set forth or reflect such event or state of facts and provide copies of such proposed amendment or supplement to shareholders. (c) on or before the date on which the registration statement is declared effective, company shall use its reasonable efforts to: -11- (i) register or qualify (and cooperate with shareholders, the underwriter or underwriters, if any, and their counsel, in connection with the registration or qualification of) the securities covered by the registration statement for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of each state and other jurisdiction as shareholders or any underwriter reasonably requests; (ii) use its reasonable efforts to keep each such registration or qualification effective, including through new filings, or amendments or renewals, during the period the registration statement or prospectus is required to be kept effective; and (iii) do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in all such jurisdictions of the common stock covered by the applicable registration statement, provided that company will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified. (d) company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause all registrable securities of shareholders included in the registration statement to be listed, by the date of the first sale of such shares pursuant to such registration statement, on each securities exchange on which the securities is then listed or proposed to be listed, if any. (e) company shall make generally available to shareholders and any underwriter participating in the offering conducted pursuant to the registration statement an earnings statement satisfying section 11(a) of the securities act no later than 45 days after the end of the 12-month period beginning with the first day of company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the -12- registration statement. the earnings statement shall cover such 12-month period. this requirement will be deemed to be satisfied if company timely files complete and accurate information on forms 10-q, 10-k, and 8-k under the exchange act, and otherwise complies with rule 158 under the securities act as soon as feasible. (f) company shall cooperate with shareholders and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing registrable securities to be sold under the registration statement, and to enable such securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or shareholders, may request, subject to the underwriters' obligation to return any certificates representing unsold securities. (g) company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause registrable securities covered by the registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities in the united states (including the registration of registrable securities under the exchange act) as may be necessary to enable shareholders or the underwriter or underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such securities. (h) company shall, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make available for inspection by shareholders, any underwriter participating in any offering pursuant to the registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by shareholders or any such underwriter (collectively, the "inspectors"), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of company (including non-public information), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the inspectors to exercise -13- their due diligence responsibilities; provided that any inspector receiving non-public information shall have previously entered into an appropriate confidentiality agreement in mutually satisfactory form and substance. company shall also cause its officers, directors, and employees to supply all nonconfidential information reasonably requested by any inspector in connection with the registration statement. (i) company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain a "cold comfort" letter and, as applicable, a "long-form comfort letter" from company's independent public accountants, and an opinion of counsel for company, each in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by cold comfort letters and long form comfort letters and legal opinions in connection with public offerings of securities, as shareholders reasonably request. (j) company shall enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement containing such representations and warranties by company and such other terms and provisions, as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements for comparable offerings and are reasonably satisfactory to the company) and take all such other actions as shareholders or the underwriters participating in such offering and sale may reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate such offering and sale (other than such actions which are disruptive to the company or require significant management availability). article iii indemnification 3.1. indemnification by company. in the event of any registration under the securities act by any registration statement pursuant to rights granted in this -14- agreement of registrable securities held by shareholders, company will hold harmless shareholders and each underwriter of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls any shareholder or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (including legal fees and costs of court), joint or several, to which shareholders or such underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or any actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact (i) contained, on its effective date, in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, or which arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) contained in any preliminary prospectus, if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement, or in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented if company shall have filed with the sec any amendment or supplement to the final prospectus) if used within the period which company is required to keep the registration to which such registration statement or prospectus relates current under section 2.4, or which arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission (if so used) to state a material fact required to be stated in such prospectus or necessary to make the statements in such prospectus not misleading; and will reimburse shareholders and each such underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, or liability; provided, however, that company shall not be liable to any shareholder or its underwriters or controlling persons in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in -15- conformity with information furnished to company through a written instrument duly executed by shareholders or such underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof. 3.2. indemnification by shareholders. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of company to include in any registration statement any registrable securities of shareholders that company shall have received from shareholders an undertaking, reasonably satisfactory to company and its counsel, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 3.1) company, each director of company, each officer of company who shall sign the registration statement, and any person who controls company within the meaning of the securities act, (i) with respect to any statement or omission from such registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to it, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to company through a written instrument duly executed by shareholders specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement or amendment or supplement, and (ii) with respect to compliance by shareholders with applicable laws in effecting the sale or other disposition of the securities covered by such registration statement. 3.3 indemnification procedures. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in the preceding sections of this article iii, the indemnified party will, if a resulting claim is to be made or may be made against and indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of the action. if any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense of the action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election to assume defense of the action, the indemnifying party -16- will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by the latter in connection with the action's defense. an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such indemnified party's expense unless (a) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, which authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense and employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within 30 days after notice of any such action or proceeding, or (iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party), it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to all local counsel which is necessary, in the good faith opinion of both counsel for the indemnifying party and counsel for the indemnified party in order to adequately represent the indemnified parties) for the indemnified party and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred upon written request and presentation of invoices. whether or not a defense is assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent. no indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term the -17- giving by the claimant or plaintiff, to the indemnified party, of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. 3.4. contribution. if the indemnification required by this article iii from the indemnifying party is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any indemnifiable losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefit of the indemnifying and indemnified parties and (ii) if the allocation in clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit referred to in clause (i) and also the relative fault of the indemnified and indemnifying parties, in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damage, liabilities, and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. company and shareholders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 3.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the prior provisions of this section 3.4. -18- notwithstanding the provisions of this section 3.4, no indemnifying party shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of [the amount by which the total price at which the securities were offered to the public by the indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages which the indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of an untrue statement or omission]. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such a fraudulent misrepresentation. article iv other agreements 4.1. other registration rights. company agrees that it will not grant to any party registration rights which would allow such party to limit shareholders' priority for the sale or distribution of registrable securities upon the exercise of a demand registration right pursuant to section 2.2. 4.2. expenses. all expenses incurred by company in connection with any registration statement covering registrable securities offered by shareholders, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees (including all expenses incident to filing with the national association of securities dealers, inc.), printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel (except for the fees and disbursements of counsel for shareholders) and of the independent certified public accountants (except, in the case of any special audits, if required in connection with any such registration, shareholders' proportionate share of their expense as provided in section 2.4), and the expense of qualifying such shares under state blue sky laws, shall be borne by company, including such expenses of any registration delayed by the company under the fourth paragraph of section 2.2; provided, however, that company shall not be required to pay -19- for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to section 2.2 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of shareholders (in which case shareholders shall bear such expenses), unless shareholders agrees to forfeit their right to one demand registration under section 2.2; provided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, shareholders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the company from that known at the time of its request, then shareholders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to section 2.2. company's obligations under this section 4.2 shall apply to each registration under the securities act or state blue sky legislation pursuant to section 2.2. however, all underwriting expenses incurred by shareholders, including underwriter's discounts and commissions and legal, accounting and similar expenses, shall be borne by shareholders. 4.3. dispositions during registration. each shareholder agrees that, without the consent of the managing underwriter(s) in an underwritten offering in respect of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, it will not effect any sale or distribution of common stock or securities convertible into common stock (other than registrable securities included in such offering), during the ten (10) day period prior to, and during the ninety (90) day period beginning on, the effective date of the registration statement filed by the company in respect of such underwritten offering, or any shorter period as may apply to the company and its affiliates. 4.4. transfer of rights. all rights of shareholders under this agreement shall be transferable by shareholders to a related transferee (as defined in the shareholders agreement) who acquires shares of common stock in compliance with section 4.1(f) of the shareholders agreement and who executes an instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the company in which it agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement as if an original signatory hereto, in which case such related transferee -20- shall thereafter be a "shareholder" for all purposes of this agreement. the incidental registration rights or benefits of this agreement and the demand registration rights, including indemnification by company, shall be transferable by shareholders only in a transaction permitted under section 4.1(c) or 4.1(d) of the shareholders agreement to a transferee that is not an affiliate of the company who receives at least an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, in the case of incidental registration rights, or 5,000,000 shares of common stock for each right to demand registration, in the case of demand registration rights. in the case of any assignment, the party or parties who have the rights and benefits of shareholders under this agreement shall become parties to and be subject to this agreement, and shall not, as a group, have the right to request any greater number of registrations than shareholders would have had if no assignment had occurred. upon any transfer of the registration rights or benefits of this agreement, shareholders shall give company written notice prior to or promptly following such transfer stating the name and address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which such rights are being assigned. such notice shall include or be accompanied by a written undertaking by the transferee to comply with the obligations imposed hereunder. in the event any registration rights are transferred in accordance with the terms of this agreement, any actions required to be taken by shareholders will be taken with the approval of the holders of such registration rights who hold a majority of the registrable securities, whose actions shall bind all such holders of such registration rights. 4.5. best registration rights. if the company grants to any person with respect to any security issued by the company or any of its affiliates registration rights that provide for terms that are in any manner more favorable to the holder of such registration rights than the terms granted to the shareholders other than the number of demand registrations or the minimum amount of shares required to exercise demand -21- registration rights (or if the company amends or waives any provision of any agreement providing registration rights of others or takes any other action whatsoever to provide for terms that are more favorable to other holders than the terms provided to the shareholders other than the number of demand registrations or the minimum amount of shares required to exercise demand registration rights), then this agreement shall immediately be deemed amended to provide the shareholders with any (or all) of such more favorable terms as shareholders shall elect to include herein. article v miscellaneous 5.1. notices. all notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, fax or air courier guaranteeing delivery: (a) if to the company, to: allied waste industries, inc. 7701 east camelback
