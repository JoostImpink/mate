on behalf of the registrants (as defined in the original 13d). capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the original 13d. item 4. purpose of transaction item 4 is hereby amended by adding the following: the issuer conducted an auction process, under the auspices of a special committee comprised of non-management, independent members of its board of directors (the "special committee"), to sell its national wireline telecommunications business. on november 4, 2005, the auction process culminated in elk associates llc, an entity affiliated with the registrants ("elk"), emerging as the winning bidder and entering into an equity purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement") with the issuer and xo holdings, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer, providing for the sale to elk of the issuer's national wireline telecommunications business for an aggregate purchase price of $700 million in cash. prior to the commencement of the auction, the issuer had retained investment bankers to develop and make recommendations regarding its strategic alternatives. this was followed by the establishment of the special committee which retained attorneys and investment bankers to advise it in its determination of whether and to whom to sell the issuer's national wireline telecommunications business. the purchase agreement is subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions and can be terminated by the issuer prior to closing in certain circumstances where a third party submits a superior offer. in this regard, on november 4, 2005, cardiff entered into a stockholder voting agreement (the "voting agreement"), pursuant to which it agreed to vote its shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement or, if the special committee recommends certain superior proposals, such superior proposal. the purchase agreement and certain related documents were filed by the issuer with the issuer's form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 9, 2005. the foregoing descriptions of the purchase agreement and the voting agreement
