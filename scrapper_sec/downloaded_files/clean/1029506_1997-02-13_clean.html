(b) until such time as the vail equity has been registered pursuant to a registration statement under the securities act or sold pursuant to rule 144 of the securities act, the certificates representing vail equity (including, without limitation, all certificates issued upon transfer or in exchange or substitution therefor) will also bear any legend required under any other applicable laws, including state securities or blue sky laws. (c) vail may make a notation on its records or give stop-transfer instructions to any transfer agents or registrars for the vail equity in order to implement the restrictions set forth in this article iii. (d) in the event foods acquires any other or additional vail securities, foods will submit all certificates representing such vail securities to vail so that any appropriate legend or legends required by this section 3.4 may be placed thereon. iv right of first offer iv.1 sales by foods. (a) prior to any transfer pursuant to section 3.2(e), (f), (g) and (h), foods must first give written notice of its intent to make such transfer (a "transfer notice") to vail and apollo setting forth the number of shares of vail equity (the "section 4.1 shares") that foods desires to transfer and the cash price that foods proposes to be paid for such section 4.1 shares and the other terms and conditions of such proposed transfer. (b) vail shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the section 4.1 shares (the "first option") on the 20 -16- same terms and conditions as set forth in such notice, which option shall be exercised by delivering to foods irrevocable written notice of its commitment to purchase the section 4.1 shares within ten business days after receipt of the transfer notice (the "vail option period"). failure by vail to give such notice within such ten-business-day period shall be deemed an election by vail not to purchase the section 4.1 shares. (c) in the event that vail decides not to purchase the section 4.1 shares pursuant to section 4.1(b), then apollo will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the section 4.1 shares (the "second option") on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the transfer notice, which option shall be exercised by delivering to foods irrevocable written notice of its commitment to purchase the section 4.1 shares within five business days after the termination of the vail option period (the "apollo option period"). failure by apollo to give such notice within such five-business-day period shall be deemed an election by apollo not to purchase the section 4.1 shares. (d) delivery of written notice by vail or apollo accepting the first option or the second option, as the case may be, shall constitute a contract between vail or apollo, on the one hand, and foods, on the other hand, for the purchase and sale of the section 4.1 shares on the terms and conditions set forth in the transfer notice. the purchase of any shares pursuant to the exercise of the first option or the second option, as the case may be, shall be completed not later than 30 days following delivery of the transfer notice with respect to the section 4.1 shares, subject to receipt of any required material third-party or governmental approvals, compliance with applicable laws and the absence of any injunction or similar legal order preventing such transaction. in the event that neither the first option nor the second option is exercised, foods shall have the right for a period of 45 days after the termination of the apollo option period to transfer the section 4.1 shares at a price not less than 90% of the price contained in, and on terms and conditions no less favorable to foods than those set forth in, the transfer notice; provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by the 21 -17- terms and conditions of this agreement (unless the transfer is pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act). v registration v.1 demand registration. (a) after the consummation of an ipo or at such time prior to the consummation of an ipo as is permitted by section 10.3 with respect to a given shareholder, upon a shareholder's written request specifying the intended manner of disposition (including the number of shares of vail equity to be sold) (a "demand notice"), vail will use its best efforts to prepare and file with the sec, as expeditiously as possible, a registration statement on an available form for which vail then qualifies (but not including by means of a shelf registration pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act), which legal counsel for vail deems appropriate and which is available for the sale of vail equity to permit an underwritten public offering of some or all of the shares of vail equity then held by such shareholder and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective (a "demand registration"). (b) a demand registration will not be deemed to have occurred until it has become effective under the securities act (unless a shareholder delivers a demand notice and subsequently withdraws the demand notice, in which case such demand registration will be deemed to have occurred unless such shareholder agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such registration actually incurred by vail); provided, however, that if, after a demand registration has become effective, the offering of vail equity pursuant to such demand registration is prohibited by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the sec or other governmental agency or a court, such demand registration will be deemed not to have occurred (unless such prohibition on the sale of the vail equity is based on actions or omissions of such shareholder, in 22 -18- which case such demand registration will be deemed to have occurred unless such shareholder agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such registration actually incurred by vail). (c) vail shall only be obligated to effect one demand registration per shareholder in any twelve month period under this section 5.1; provided, however, that vail will not be required to register the vail equity pursuant to a demand notice under this section 5.1 if at such time (i) the shares of vail equity which a shareholder is requesting to be registered pursuant to this section 5.1 constitute less than 6.0% (or, if less, all of the shares of vail equity owned by such shareholder) of the outstanding vail securities so requested to be registered or (ii) such demand notice is given within six (6) months after the effective date of any other registration of any vail securities under the securities act. (d) the managing underwriter will be selected by the shareholder requesting registration pursuant to this section 5.1 (the "requesting shareholder"); provided, however, that such underwriter shall be subject to the approval of vail, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. in the event there is one or more co-managers, the first such co-manager shall be selected by vail, provided that such co-manager shall be subject to the approval of the requesting shareholder, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and all other co-managers will be selected by the requesting shareholder. (e) in connection with a demand registration, both the shareholder not requesting the demand registration (the "non-requesting shareholder") and vail may elect to include additional shares of vail securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the vail equity to be sold by the requesting shareholder; provided, however, that if the managing underwriter(s) advises the requesting shareholder, the non-requesting shareholder and vail that, in its judgment, the number of shares proposed to be included in such offering exceeds the largest number of vail securities which can be sold without 23 -19- having an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such securities can be sold (the "marketable number"), then the total number of shares to be included in such offering shall be limited as follows: (i) first, all the shares of vail equity that the requesting shareholder and the non-requesting shareholder propose to sell up to the marketable number, allocated pro rata between the requesting shareholder and the non-requesting shareholder on the basis of the relative number of vail securities that the requesting shareholder and the non-requesting shareholder have proposed to be included in such registration, and (ii) second, all the shares of vail securities that vail proposes to sell, which does not exceed the difference, if any, between the marketable number and that number of shares which the requesting shareholder and the non-requesting shareholder have included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above. v.2 delay of demand registration. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in article v hereof, in the event that vail determines in its reasonable judgment that it may be advisable to delay filing a registration statement described in section 5.1 hereof or to withdraw such registration statement if such registration statement has already been filed, vail may delay filing such, or withdraw such previously filed, registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the request for the demand registration if vail furnishes to the requesting shareholder a certificate signed by an executive officer of vail stating that vail has reasonably determined that (i) such a filing would adversely affect any proposed financing or acquisition by vail or (ii) such a filing would otherwise represent an undue hardship for vail; provided, however, that vail will, at the request of the requesting shareholder, file or refile, as the case may be, such registration statement promptly after vail, in its reasonable judgment, determines that it is no longer advisable to delay filing or to continue the withdrawal of such registration statement but in no event shall the filing or re-filing of such registration statement be delayed more than the aforementioned ninety (90) days. 24 -20- v.3 piggyback registration. (a) right to include vail equity. (i) if vail or any other person (other than a shareholder) at any time proposes to register any vail securities under the securities act (other than a registration of securities in connection with a merger, an acquisition, an exchange offer or an employee benefit plan maintained by vail or its affiliates or on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor or similar form or by means of a shelf registration pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act to permit sales of vail securities by employees, officers and directors of vail), whether or not for sale for its own account, in a manner which would permit registration of the vail equity for sale to the public under the securities act, it will give written notice to each shareholder of its intention to do so and of such shareholder's rights under this section 5.3(a)(i), at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the anticipated filing date of a registration statement relating to such registration (a "piggyback notice"). such piggyback notice will offer each shareholder the opportunity to include in such registration statement that number of shares of vail equity as such shareholder may request. upon the written request (the "piggyback registration") (which request will specify the number of shares of vail equity intended to be disposed of by each shareholder pursuant to such registration statement) of each shareholder (the "piggyback shareholder") made within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt of the piggyback notice, vail will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of all shares of vail equity which vail has been so requested to register; provided, however, that each shareholder must sell its vail equity requested to be included in such registration to the underwriter(s) selected by vail on the same terms and conditions as apply to other persons, including vail, and if, at any time after receiving a reply from each shareholder to a piggyback notice and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, vail decides for any reason not to register any shares of vail securities, vail will notify each shareholder and 25 -21- thereupon be relieved of its obligation to register any vail equity in connection with such registration. (ii) no registration, whether or not effected under this section 5.3(a), will relieve vail of its obligations to effect demand registrations under section 5.1 hereof. (b) priority in piggyback registrations. if the managing underwriter advises vail in writing that, in its opinion, the marketable number is less than that intended to be included in a registration statement, vail will include in such registration statement (i) first, all of the vail securities vail proposes to sell for its own account, and (ii) second, the vail securities requested to be included by the shareholders and other persons pursuant to section 5.3(a) hereof shall be allocated pro rata among the shareholders on the basis of the relative number of vail securities each shareholder and such other persons has requested to be included in such registration. v.4 delay of piggyback registration. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article v, in the event that vail determines in its reasonable judgment that it may be advisable to delay filing a registration statement described in section 5.3 hereof or to withdraw such registration statement if such registration statement has already been filed, vail may delay filing such, or withdraw such previously filed, registration statement in accordance with the provisions of section 5.2 hereof. v.5 holdback agreements. (a) whenever vail effects an underwritten public offering of vail equity pursuant to a registration statement (including the ipo), each shareholder agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, of any vail securities (other than as part of such registration) during the 15 days prior to, and during the 180-day period (or such shorter period as may be 26 -22- requested by the lead underwriter for such offering) beginning on, the effective date of such registration statement. (b) in connection with underwritten public offering of vail equity pursuant to a registration statement under this agreement, vail agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of any vail securities (other than as part of such registration or in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan or any private issuance of vail equity where the recipient also agrees to be bound by the hold back arrangements applicable to vail under this section 5.5) during the 15 days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or such shorter period as may be requested by the lead underwriter for such offering) beginning on the effective date of, such registration statement. v.6 right to purchase in lieu of registration. (a) any time vail receives a request for a demand registration or a piggyback registration from foods, vail shall have the option to purchase all but not less than all of the vail equity proposed to be disposed of in such request (the "section 5.6 shares") at the vail market price by delivering to foods, a notice of vail's election to purchase the section 5.6 shares within seven (7) days of receipt by vail of the request for the demand registration or piggyback registration, as the case may be, pursuant to section 5.1 or section 5.3(a), as the case may be. (b) in the event that vail decides not to purchase the section 5.6 shares pursuant to section 5.6(a), then apollo will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the section 5.6 shares at the vail market price by delivering to foods a notice of apollo's election to purchase the section 5.6 shares within seven (7) days of vail deciding not to purchase the section 5.6 shares. vi 27 -23- registration expenses vi.1 registration expenses.

(b) at any time when a sale or other disposition of vail equity pursuant to a registration statement is subject to a prospectus delivery requirement, vail will notify each shareholder of the occurrence of any event that causes the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, to include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and vail will use its best efforts, as expeditiously as possible, to either amend the prospectus or otherwise take any actions so that use of the previous prospectus may be legally resumed. upon receipt of such a notice, each shareholder will immediately discontinue all sales or other dispositions of vail equity pursuant to the registration statement. each shareholder may resume such sales or dispositions only upon receipt of an amended prospectus or after such shareholder is advised by vail that the use of the previous prospectus may be legally resumed. vii.4 blue sky compliance. vail will use its best efforts to (a) register or qualify the vail equity included in a registration statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each shareholder reasonably requests and 30 -26- (b) do any and all other acts that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each shareholder to consummate the public sale or disposition of such securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that vail is not required to consent to, or take any action that would subject it to, general service of process or taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject, nor qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified. vii.5 listing of vail equity. vail will use its best efforts to cause the vail equity when issued to be listed on all securities exchanges on which any securities issued by vail are then listed, or quoted on all automated quotation systems on which any such securities of vail are then quoted, including, without limitation, entering into appropriate customary agreements (including a listing application and indemnification agreement in customary form). vii.6 stop orders. vail will promptly notify each shareholder of (a) the receipt by vail of any notification with respect to the issuance by the sec of any stop order or order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement covering any vail equity or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or (b) the receipt by vail of any notification with respect to the limitation, restriction or suspension of the offer or sale of vail equity in any jurisdiction in which the vail equity was qualified to be sold, or the initiation of any proceedings for such purpose. in the event that vail notifies each shareholder of any such event, each shareholder will immediately discontinue all sales or other dispositions of vail equity pursuant to the registration statement until such time that vail notifies each shareholder of the lifting of such stop order or similar order; provided, however, that such a stop order or similar order issued by a state securities or blue sky administrator will apply only to offers and sales in such state, unless each shareholder is advised otherwise by vail. vail, with the cooperation of each shareholder, will use its best efforts to contest any such proceedings and to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible date. 31 -27- viii indemnification and contribution viii.1 indemnification. (a) indemnification by foods. (i) foods agrees to indemnify and hold harmless vail and its affiliates and associates (each such person being hereinafter referred to as a "vail indemnified party") from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) (each a "loss") arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or preliminary, final or summary prospectus covering the vail equity, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only if, and only to the extent, such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to vail or its representatives by or on behalf of foods for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto, or such document incorporated by reference. this indemnity will be in addition to any liability which foods may otherwise have. foods will also indemnify the underwriter(s), selling broker(s), dealer manager(s) and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each person who controls such persons to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of a vail indemnified party.

(iii) if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation or inquiry) is brought or asserted against a vail indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from foods, such vail indemnified party will promptly notify foods in writing of the commencement of such action and foods shall assume the defense thereof and have primary control over any related suit or proceeding, including the employment of legal counsel and the payment of all expenses in connection therewith; provided, however, that the failure of any vail indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve foods of its obligations under this section 8.1(a) except to the extent that foods is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. a vail indemnified party shall have the right to participate in and jointly with foods, to the extent that it may wish, and employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to such vail indemnified party, provided, however, that foods will not be liable to such vail indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by such vail indemnified party in connection therewith, unless such vail indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest between such vail indemnified party and foods is likely to exist in respect of such claim. (b) indemnification by apollo. (i) apollo agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each vail indemnified party from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or preliminary, final or summary prospectus covering the vail equity, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in 33 -29- any document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only if, and only to the extent, such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to vail or its representatives by or on behalf of apollo for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto, or such document incorporated by reference. this indemnity will be in addition to any liability which apollo may otherwise have. apollo will also indemnify the underwriter(s), selling broker(s), dealer manager(s) and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each person who controls such persons to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of a vail indemnified party.

(iii) if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation or inquiry) is brought or asserted against a vail indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from apollo, such vail indemnified party will promptly notify apollo in writing of the commencement of such action and apollo shall assume the defense thereof and have primary control over any related suit or proceeding, including the employment of legal counsel and the payment of all expenses in connection therewith; provided, however, that the failure of any vail indemnified party to give notice as provided herein 34 -30- shall not relieve apollo of its obligations under this section 8.1(b) except to the extent that apollo is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. a vail indemnified party shall have the right to participate in and jointly with apollo, to the extent that it may wish, and employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to such vail indemnified party, provided, however, that apollo will not be liable to such vail indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by such vail indemnified party in connection therewith, unless such vail indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest between such vail indemnified party and apollo is likely to exist in respect of such claim. (c) indemnification by vail. (i) vail agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each shareholder and its affiliates and associates (each such person being hereinafter referred to as a "shareholder indemnified party") from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus covering the vail equity, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses arise out of or are based solely upon any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon written information provided by or on behalf of a shareholder for inclusion in such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or such amendment or supplement thereto, or such document incorporated by reference; provided, however, that vail will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (a) such shareholder failed to send or deliver a copy of the final prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation 35 -31- of the sale of the vail equity covered by the registration statement to the person asserting such loss, and (b) the final prospectus corrected such untrue statement or omission; and provided, further, that vail will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission in the final prospectus, if such untrue statement or omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to the final prospectus and if, having previously been furnished by or on behalf of vail with copies of the final prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such shareholder thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented, prior to or concurrently with the sale of the vail equity to the person asserting such loss who purchased such vail equity which is the subject thereof. this indemnity will be in addition to any liability which vail may otherwise have. vail will also indemnify the underwriter(s), selling broker(s), dealer manager(s) and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each person who controls such persons to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of a shareholder indemnified party. (ii) if any action or proceeding is brought against a shareholder indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought against such shareholder indemnified party, such shareholder indemnified party will promptly notify vail in writing of the commencement of such action and vail will assume the defense thereof and have primary control over any related suit or proceeding, including the employment of legal counsel and the payment of all expenses in connection therewith; provided, however, that the failure of any shareholder indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve vail of its obligations under this section 8.1(c) except to the extent that vail is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. a shareholder indemnified party shall have the right to participate in and jointly with vail, to the extent that it may wish, and employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to such shareholder indemnified party, provided, however, that vail will not be liable to such shareholder 36 -32- indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by such shareholder indemnified party in connection therewith, unless such shareholder indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest between such shareholder indemnified party and vail is likely to exist in respect of such claim. viii.2 contribution. (a) if the indemnification provided for in section 8.1 hereof is unavailable to a vail indemnified party or shareholder indemnified party under section 8.1(a), 8.1(b) or section 8.1(c) hereof (other than by reason of the exceptions provided in sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b) and 8.1(c)) in respect of any losses referred to therein, then such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnified party and each parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by each party as a result of the losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b) and 8.1(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. (b) notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.2(a) hereof, no person found to be guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any 37 -33- person who is not found to be guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 38 -34- ix take-along rights 39 -35- ix.1 take-along rights. apollo may not effect a transfer (or a series of related transfers) of vail equity to one person or a related group of persons if such transfer would result in a change of control of vail (other than transfers effected by sales of vail equity through underwriters in a public offering or in the securities markets generally) (the "section 9.1 shares") without first complying with this section 9.1. if apollo desires to transfer the section 9.1 shares, apollo shall give written notice (the "take-along notice") to foods stating (i) the name and address of the transferee (the "non-qualified transferee") and (ii) the price and terms upon which the non-qualified transferee proposes to purchase the section 9.1 shares. foods shall have the irrevocable option, but not the obligation (the "take-along option"), to sell to the non-qualified transferee, up to a number of shares of vail equity (the "included shares") determined in accordance with section 9.1(a), at the price and on the terms set forth in the take-along notice. the take-along option shall be exercised by foods by giving written notice to apollo, within ten business days of receipt of the take-along notice, indicating its election to exercise the take-along option. failure by foods to give such notice within the ten business day period shall be deemed an election by foods not to sell its shares of vail equity pursuant to that take-along notice. the closing with respect to any sale to a non-qualified transferee pursuant to this section 9.1 shall be held at the time and place specified in the take-along notice but in any event within 30 days of the date the take-along notice is given; provided that if through the exercise of reasonable efforts apollo is unable to cause such transaction to close within 30 days, such period may be extended for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary to close such transaction. consummation of the sale of the section 9.1 shares by apollo to a non-qualified transferee shall be conditioned upon consummation of the sale by foods to such non-qualified transferee of the included shares, if any. (a) the number of included shares purchased from foods shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares proposed to be purchased from apollo by a non-qualified transferee by a 40 -36- fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of vail equity owned by foods and the denominator of which is the sum of the total number of shares of vail equity owned by apollo and foods. (b) apollo shall arrange for payment directly by the non-qualified transferee to foods, upon delivery of the certificate or certificates representing the included shares duly endorsed for transfer, together with such other documents as the non-qualified transferee may reasonably request. the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by apollo and foods in connection with a sale of shares of vail equity subject to this section 9.1 shall be allocated pro rata based upon the number of shares of vail equity sold by each shareholder to a non-qualified transferee. (c) if, at end of 30 days following the date on which a take-along notice was given, the sale of shares of vail equity by apollo and the sale of the included shares, if any, have not been completed in accordance with the terms of the non-qualified transferee's offer, all certificates representing the included shares shall be returned to foods, and all the restrictions on transfer contained in this agreement with respect to shares of vail equity owned by apollo shall again be in effect. article x initial public offering x.1 ipo commitment. vail and apollo hereby agree to use reasonable efforts to consummate the ipo as soon as possible following the closing. x.2 co-manager. in connection with the ipo (unless the ipo is effected by means of a demand registration by foods), foods shall select one of the co-managers (other than the lead manager); provided, however, that such co-manager shall be subject to the approval of vail, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 41 -37- x.3 foods initiated ipo. (a) if the ipo has not been consummated on the later of (i) september 30, 1997 or (ii) nine months after the closing (the "trigger date"), apollo, vail and foods agree to abide by the procedures of this section 10.3. (b) following the trigger date, apollo and foods agree to discuss in good faith for a period of 30 days (the "discussion period") the timing of the ipo. at the conclusion of the discussion period, foods may deliver a notice to vail within 30 days (the "foods notice") stating that it will request a demand registration unless vail consummates the ipo within three months from the date of the foods notice. if at the conclusion of such three-month period the ipo has not been consummated, during the next six months foods shall have the right to request a demand registration and consummate the ipo by means of such demand registration. if at the conclusion of such six-month period the ipo has not been consummated, foods' right to request a demand registration to effect the ipo shall be suspended for a twelve-month period. if at the conclusion of such twelve-month period the ipo has not otherwise been consummated, during the next six months foods shall again have the right to request a demand registration and consummate the ipo by means of such demand registration. if the ipo is consummated by means of a demand registration by foods (the "foods initiated ipo"), then foods shall select the lead manager for the foods initiated ipo; provided, however, that such lead manager shall be subject to the approval of vail, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. vail may select one co-manager in connection with a foods initiated ipo, subject to the approval of the lead manager for the foods initiated ipo, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. xi additional covenants 42 -38- xi.1 maintain listing or quotation. vail hereby covenants and agrees that it shall use its best efforts to maintain its listing of vail securities on any securities exchanges on which vail securities are listed in the future pursuant to section 7.5 hereof and to maintain its quotation of vail securities on any automated quotation systems on which vail securities are quoted in the future pursuant to section 7.5 hereto. xi.2 board of directors. vail and the shareholders agree to take all actions necessary to cause the board of directors to consist of no more than twenty directors. as lone as foods owns at least 10% of the outstanding vail securities, vail and the shareholders agree to take all actions necessary to cause the board of directors to consist of no more than twenty directors. as long as foods owns at least 10% of the outstanding vail securities, vail and the shareholders agree to take all actions necessary for foods to be able to nominate and appoint two directors to the board of directors of vail, including without limitation apollo nominating and electing such directors as class 1 directors elected by the holders of the vail class a stock. xi.3 no inconsistent agreements. vail hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not enter into any agreements governing the transfer or registration of shares of vail securities which would materially adversely affect foods' rights under this agreement without foods' prior written consent. xi.4 rules 144 and 144a. vail hereby covenants and agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and it will take such further action as foods may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable foods to sell its vail equity (subject to the terms hereof) without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) rule 144 or 144a under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. section xi.33 limitations on holdings of foods associates. foods shall use its best efforts to cause its 43 -39- associates and associates of its affiliates not to own, in the aggregate, 2% or more of the outstanding vail securities. xii miscellaneous xii.1 entire agreement. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto relative to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior written or oral understandings, agreements, conditions or representations. xii.2 headings and captions. all headings and captions used in this agreement are for convenience only, and will not be construed to either limit or broaden the language of this agreement or any particular section. xii.3 choice of law. this agreement will be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof, except that all matters relating to the internal affairs of vail shall be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware. xii.4 venue. any action or legal proceedings to enforce this agreement or any of its terms, or for indemnification and the recovery of losses as provided for in this agreement by a party, may be brought and prosecuted in such court or courts located in the state of new york as provided by law, and the parties to this agreement consent to the jurisdiction of said court or courts and to service of process by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any other manner provided by new york law. xii.5 notices. any notice or other communication required or permitted hereunder is deemed delivered when delivered in person, when transmitted by telecopier (which will also be sent concurrently by certified or registered mail), on 44 -40- the next business day when sent by federal express or a similar overnight delivery service, or on the third business day when sent by registered or certified u.s. mail service as follows: if to foods: ralston foods, inc. 800 market street suite 2900 st. louis, missouri 63101 attn.: robert w. lockwood, esq. facsimile no.: (314) 877-7748 if to vail: vail resorts, inc.
