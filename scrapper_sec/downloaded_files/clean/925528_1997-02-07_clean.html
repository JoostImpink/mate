remainder of this cover page shall be filled out for a reporting person's initial filing on this form with respect to the subject class of securities, and for any subsequent amendment containing

schedule 13d is filed pursuant to rule 13d-1 of the rules and regulations under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") by e. i. du pont de nemours and company, a delaware corporation ("dupont") and by du pont chemical and energy operations, inc., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of dupont ("dceo"), with respect to the common stock of hudson technologies, inc., a new york corporation ("hdsn" or the "issuer"): item 1. security and issues. this schedule 13d relates to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("common stock"), of hdsn. the principal executive offices of hdsn are located at 25 torne valley road, hillburn, new york 10931-9900. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is filed by dupont and by dceo. the principal executive offices of both corporations are located at 1007 market street, wilmington, delaware 19898. dupont is one of the two largest united states chemical producers and is one of the leading chemical producers worldwide. it conducts fully integrated petroleum operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary conoco inc. and, in 1994, ranked eighth in the worldwide production of petroleum liquids by u.s.-based companies, tenth in the production of natural gas, and sixth in refining capacity. conoco inc. and other subsidiaries and affiliates of dupont conduct exploration, production, mining, manufacturing or selling activities, and some are distributors of products manufactured by dupont. dupont operates globally through approximately twenty strategic business units. within the strategic business units approximately 85 businesses manufacture and sell a wide range of products to many different markets, including the energy, transportation, textile, construction, automotive, agricultural, printing, health care, packaging and electronics markets. dupont and its subsidiaries have operations in about 70 nations worldwide and, as a result, approximately 50% of consolidated sales are derived from sales outside the united states, based on the location of the corporate unit making the sale. total worldwide employment at year-end 1995 was about 105,000 people. dceo was incorporated in delaware in 1988 and is limited by its certificate of incorporation to the making, maintenance and management of its intangible investments and the collection and distribution of the income from such investments. dceo is a wholly owned subsidiary of dupont. information concerning the directors and executive officers of dupont and dceo is contained in schedule a attached hereto. during the last five years, none of dupont or dceo nor, to the best knowledge of dupont and dceo, any director or executive officer of dupont or dceo has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding has been or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. dceo purchased 500,000 of hdsn common stock in a private placement from hdsn pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated january 29, 1997, for a cash payment of $3,500,000, all of which was obtained from cash provided by dceo's holdings. item 4. purpose of transaction. reference is made to the agreements discussed in item 6 below (collectively, the "agreements"). on january 29, 1997, dupont and hdsn formed a strategic alliance pursuant to which hdsn will provide refrigerant recovery, reclamation, separation, packaging and testing services directly to dupont for marketing through the dupont fluoroproducts business authorized distribution network. in addition, hdsn will market dupont refrigerant products to selected market segments together with hdsn reclamation and refrigerant management services. concurrent with the alliance, dceo acquired 500,000 shares of hdsn common stock in order to enable dceo to obtain a substantial equity interest in hdsn. based upon publicly available information, dceo believes that it will be the largest hdsn shareholder. accordingly, dceo may in the future seek representation on hdsn's board of directors pursuant to the agreements discussed below. except as noted above regarding potential future representation on hdsn's board of directors, dupont and dceo currently have no present plans or proposals of a type which would be required to be disclosed in this statement. neither dupont nor dceo have any present plans to acquire additional shares, but they may do so (to the extent permitted under the agreements) depending upon future market conditions and other factors. dupont and dceo also reserve the right to dispose of some or all of the shares presently owned (as permitted by the agreements), but each of them have no present plans in this regard. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. as of january 29, 1997, dceo directly owns 500,000 shares of common stock of the hdsn. such shares constitute approximately 10 percent of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of such date. no director or executive officer of dupont or dceo beneficially owns any shares of common stock of the hdsn. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. dupont, dceo, hdsn and certain hdsn stockholders have entered into several agreements dated as of january 29, 1997 (the "agreements"), which are filed as exhibits to this agreement. reference is made to such exhibits for the complete text of the agreements, and the following description of the agreements is qualified by such reference. the agreements provide, among other things, that, during their term: (1) as a general matter, dupont and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "dupont group") will not acquire voting securities of hdsn if the effect of such acquisition would be to increase the ownership of the dupont group to more than 20% of the combined voting power of all voting securities of hdsn at the time outstanding. dupont will be relieved of this restriction if (a) any other person acquires, or makes a tender or exchange offer for, hdsn voting securities representing more than 20% of the combined voting securities at the time outstanding, (b) it is publicly disclosed or dupont otherwise learns that voting securities representing more than 20% of the total voting power have been acquired subsequent to january 1, 1997, or are proposed (in a public announcement or filing) to be acquired subsequent to such date by any person or group, or (c) any person shall beneficially own voting securities representing a percentage of total voting power which exceeds the greater of (x) 10% or (y) the percentage of total voting power represented by the dupont voting power at such time, or (d) pursuant to its rights to purchase voting securities under the shareholders agreement between dceo, dupont, the company and certain principal shareholders of the company dated january 29, 1997 (the "shareholders agreement"). (2) no member of the dupont group will solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" (as those terms are defined in regulation 14a under the securities act of 1934) in opposition to the recommendation of the majority of the directors of hdsn with respect to any matter, except that if dupont may oppose any solicitation by hdsn's management with respect to any significant event. for this purpose, the term "significant event" means any charter or bylaw amendment (other than a proposal to require cumulative voting in the election of directors), acquisition or disposition of assets (by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise), change in capitalization, liquidation, or other action out of the ordinary course of business of hdsn. (3) no member of the dupont group will offer, sell or transfer any hdsn voting securities without offering hdsn a right of first refusal in the manner specified in the agreements, except that these provisions will not apply to transfers (a) to any member of the dupont group, (b) pursuant to a bona fide public offering, registered under the securities act of 1933 (the "act"), so long as no sales are made to any person or related group who would thereafter own more than 5% of the total combined voting power of hdsn voting securities then outstanding, or (c) pursuant to rule 144 under the act"), so long as no sales are made to any person or related group who would thereafter own more than 5% of the total combined voting power of hdsn voting securities then outstanding. (4) upon dupont and dceo's written request, two designees of dupont and dceo will be elected to the hdsn board of directors, provided that the dupont group continues to beneficially own 50% of the hdsn shares purchased. (5) hdsn will not take or recommend to its shareholders without dupont's consent any action which would impose limitations on the legal rights of the dupont group as hdsn shareholders other than those imposed pursuant to the express terms of the agreements, provided that the dupont group continues to beneficially own 50% of the hdsn shares purchased. (6) hdsn will provide to dceo a "demand" registration right if dceo should desire to dispose of its shares after january 29, 1999. (7) dupont and dceo have agreed with certain other hdsn shareholders not to sell any hdsn shares for one year, except for certain de minimus sales by such hdsn shareholders into the public market pursuant to any registered public offering or rule 144 under the securities act of 1933. (8) pursuant to the shareholders' agreement, such hdsn shareholders have provided dupont and dceo certain rights of first refusal to buy shares of hdsn currently held or later acquired pursuant to stock options currently held by such shareholders along with certain rights to include shares held by the dupont group in certain sales by any such shareholder to certain third parties, and such hdsn shareholders have agreed to vote their shares for any dupont and dceo designees to the hdsn board of directors as discussed above. the term of the standstill agreement expires on january 29, 2002. upon termination of the agreement, all covenants of the parties expire. the agreement may be terminated prior to the stated termination date if (a) a party defaults in its obligations or (b) dupont's designees are not elected. if this termination notice is given, any of dupont's designees will resign from the hdsn board. the term of the shareholders' agreement expires on january 29, 2002, unless prior thereto the dupont group does not continue to beneficially own at least 50% of the hdsn shares purchased. except for the foregoing agreements and the alliance agreements discussed above, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of hdsn. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. the following agreements are filed as an exhibit to this schedule 13d. a. agreement dated february 5, 1997, between dupont and dceo in which both agree that this schedule is filed on behalf of both of them. b. stock purchase agreement dated january 29, 1997. c. shareholders' agreement dated january 29, 1997. d. standstill agreement dated january 29, 1997. e. registration agreement dated january 29, 1997. signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. e. i. du pont de nemours and company by: /s/ john c. sargent ------------------------------- john c. sargent vice president and treasurer du pont chemical and energy operations, inc. by: /s/ c. l. downing ------------------------------- c. l. downing vice president schedule a ---------- 1. set forth below are the name, address and present principal occupation or employment with e. i. du pont de nemours and company of each director and executive officer. with the exception of percy n. barnevik, who is a swedish citizen, each person listed below is a citizen of the united states of america. name and address position -

(ii) dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice shall use their best efforts to cause any determination of the value of any securities included in the purchase price to be made within three (3) business days after the date of delivery of the transfer notice. if dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice are unable to agree upon the value of any such securities within such three-day period, dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the date of delivery of the transfer notice) cause the selection of the property valuation firm whose determination, which shall be made within three (3) business days of its selection, shall be conclusive. (iii) dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice shall use their best efforts to cause any determination of the value of property other than securities to be made within five (5) business days after the date of delivery of the transfer notice. if dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice are unable to agree upon a value within such five-day period, dupont and the member of the stockholders group who gave such transfer notice shall promptly (but in no event later than seven (7) business days after the date of delivery of the transfer notice) cause the selection of the property valuation firm whose determination, which shall be made within five (5) business days of its selection, shall be conclusive.
