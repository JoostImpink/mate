support agreement, it will not (i) transfer (as such term is defined in the support agreement) any of its common or preferred units or any right or interest therein; (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding that could violate or conflict with such covenanting unitholder&#146;s representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under the support agreement; (iii) take any

best efforts to effect such resignations. the merger agreement prohibits k-sea from incurring debt, issuing securities or changing its capitalization without kirby&#146;s prior written consent, except under limited circumstances set forth therein. the merger agreement also - 4 - prohibits k-sea from making, declaring, setting aside or paying any dividends or distributions in respect of any of its equity interests (other than the payment of a quarterly distribution to the holders of the preferred units), or repurchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring any of its equity interests or other securities without kirby&#146;s prior written consent, except under limited circumstances set forth therein. if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, the surviving company of the merger will become a wholly owned subsidiary of kirby. the merger agreement contains provisions that limit the ability of k-sea and specified representatives of k-sea to engage in a transaction that would effect a change of control of k-sea (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. promptly after the consummation of the merger, the common units will be deregistered under the act and delisted from the new york stock exchange. other than as described above, kirby
