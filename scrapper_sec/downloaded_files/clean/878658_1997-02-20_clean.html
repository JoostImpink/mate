$.01 par value per share ("class a common stock"), of gaylord entertainment company ("issuer"), a delaware corporation with its principal executive offices at one gaylord drive, nashville, tennessee 37214. item 2. identity and background the address of the principal office and the principal business of westinghouse electric corporation ("westinghouse"), a pennsylvania corporation, is westinghouse building, 11 stanwix street, pittsburgh, pennsylvania 15222-1384. westinghouse conducts its businesses through its westinghouse/cbs group and its industries & technology group. the operations of the westinghouse/cbs group principally relate to broadcasting, while the industries & technology group provides services, fuel and equipment for the nuclear energy market, services and equipment for the power generation market, transport refrigeration services and management services at government-owned facilities. during the last five years, neither westinghouse nor, to the knowledge of westinghouse, any executive officer or director of westinghouse (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. page 3 of 9 4 the attached schedule i is a list of the directors and executive officers of westinghouse which contains the following information with respect to each such person: (a) name; (b) business address; and (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted. except for robert e. cawthorn and david k. p. li, who are both british

9, 1997 among westinghouse, certain stockholders of issuer set forth on schedule a thereto (the "principal stockholders") and edward l. gaylord, edith gaylord harper, christine gaylord everest, edward k. gaylord ii and martin c. dickinson, in their capacity as trustees (the "trustees"), of that certain voting trust (the "trust") created pursuant to the agreement dated as of october 3, 1990, as amended by amendment no. 1 to voting trust agreement dated as of october 23, 1991, among the trustees and certain stockholders of issuer party thereto from time to time, westinghouse may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 39,238,431 shares of class a common stock. see response to item 5. the principal stockholders and the trustees entered into the stockholder agreement to induce westinghouse to enter into, and in consideration of its entering into, the agreement and plan of merger dated as of february 9, 1997 (the "merger agreement") among westinghouse, g acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of westinghouse ("sub") and issuer. page 4 of 9 5 the descriptions of the stockholder agreement and the merger agreement contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreements, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 4. purpose of transaction the purpose of the stockholder agreement (the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference) was to induce westinghouse to enter into the merger agreement and to facilitate the merger of sub with and into issuer (the "merger"), with issuer surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of westinghouse, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference). in addition to providing for the merger, the merger agreement provides, among other things, for changes to the board of directors, management, certificate of incorporation and by-laws of issuer at the effective time of the merger. the merger agreement also restricts issuer from, among other things, engaging in certain transactions, including extraordinary corporate transactions (other than the merger), making certain acquisitions, selling certain assets, changing its capitalization in certain respects and paying certain dividends and otherwise requires issuer to operate in the ordinary course of business. in connection with the merger, it is expected that the class a common stock will be delisted from all exchanges upon which it is listed and will become eligible for termination of registration under the securities exchange act of 1934. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer as of february 9, 1997, the shares subject to the stockholder agreement consisted of (i) 49,612 shares of class a common stock owned of page 5 of 9 6 record by the principal stockholders, (ii) 1,420,863 shares of class b common stock, $.01 par value per share ("class b common stock"), of issuer owned of record by the principal stockholders and (iii) 37,767,956 shares of class b common stock owned of record by the trust (together with all shares of capital stock of issuer deposited in or otherwise acquired by the trust after february 9, 1997, the "trust shares"), as well as any shares of capital stock of issuer acquired by the principal stockholders or the trust after february 9, 1997 (including pursuant to the exercise of options held by the principal stockholders). as of january 31, 19971(1), the shares of class a common stock and class b common stock subject to the stockholder agreement represented approximately 64.9% of the aggregate voting power ("voting power") of issuer.(2) as of january 31, 1997, the shares of class a common stock subject to the stockholder agreement represented approximately 0.1% of the class a common stock then outstanding and less than .02% of the voting power. the shares of class b common stock subject to the stockholder agreement (including the trust shares) are convertible into shares of class a common stock at any time and automatically convert upon the occurrence of certain events. however, under the terms of the stockholder agreement (i) the trustees have agreed not to consent to the withdrawal of any of the trust shares from the trust and not to take any action that would result in the conversion of any of - -------- (1) unless otherwise indicated, information in this item 5 stated to be as of january 31, 1997 is calculated based on the number of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock outstanding as of january 31, 1997, as set forth in the merger agreement, and the number of shares subject to the stockholder agreement as set forth in the first sentence of this item 5. (2) as of january 31, 1997, issuer had two classes of common stock outstanding entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders: class a common stock and class b common stock. for most matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders (including the merger), holders of class a common stock and class b common stock will be entitled to one and five votes, respectively, per share. page 6 of 9 7 the trust shares into shares of class a common stock and (ii) the principal stockholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or otherwise transfer any shares of class a common stock or class b common stock (whether owned of record or beneficially), not to convert or cause to be converted any shares of class b common stock owned of record into shares of class a common stock and not to transfer to the trustees any trust certificates in connection with the withdrawal of any trust shares from the trust. if, however, the shares of class b common stock subject to the stockholder agreement were converted into shares of class a common stock, as of january 31 1997 the shares subject to the stockholder agreement would consist of 39,238,431 shares of class a common stock, representing approximately 46.6% of the class a common stock then outstanding and approximately 27% of the voting power. accordingly, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, westinghouse may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of 39,238,431 shares of class a common stock. under the terms of the stockholder agreement, the trustees have agreed to vote (or cause to be voted) the trust shares and each of the principal stockholders has agreed to vote (or cause to be voted) the class a common stock and class b common stock owned of record by such principal stockholder, (i) in favor of the merger, the adoption by issuer of the merger agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and each of the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) against any alternative takeover proposal or any amendment to issuer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other proposal or transaction involving issuer or any of its subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby or change in any manner the voting page 7 of 9 8 rights of the class a common stock or the class b common stock. in addition, under the terms of the stockholder agreement, each principal stockholder has agreed not to enter into any voting arrangement in connection with any alternative takeover proposal. accordingly, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, westinghouse may be deemed to have acquired shared voting and dispositive power with respect to all such shares. except as described above, neither westinghouse nor, to westinghouse's knowledge, any person named in schedule i beneficially owns any shares of class a common stock or has effected any transactions in class a common stock during the past 60 days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer the information set forth under items 3, 4 and 5 above and the exhibits attached hereto are incorporated herein by reference. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1: stockholder agreement dated as of february 9, 1997, among westinghouse, the principal stockholders and the trustees. exhibit 2: agreement and plan of merger dated as of february 9, 1997, among westinghouse, sub and issuer.

electric corporation, a pennsylvania corporation ("parent"), g acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), and gaylord entertainment company, a delaware corporation (the "company"). whereas the board of directors of the company has approved an agreement and plan of distribution in the form of annex a attached hereto with such changes as may be made in accordance with section 6.14 (the "distribution agreement"), which will be entered into prior to the effective time (as defined in section 1.03) subject to the issuance of the tax rulings (as such term is defined in section 10.03), pursuant to and subject to the terms of which (a) the assets and businesses of the company and its subsidiaries (as defined in section 10.03) will be restructured as a result of which (i) all the assets of the company and its subsidiaries, other than the retained assets (as defined in section 10.03), will be held by gaylord broadcasting company, a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company ("gbc"), or one or more of gbc's subsidiaries and (ii) all the liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries, other than the retained liabilities (as defined in section 10.03), will be assumed by gbc or one or more of gbc's subsidiaries, (b) gbc will be recapitalized in accordance with article ii of the distribution agreement and (c) following such restructuring and recapitalization, the company will distribute (the "company distribution") to each holder of record of shares of class a common stock, $.01 par value, of the company ("company class a common stock") and class b common stock, $.01 par value, of the company ("company class b common stock" and, together with the company class a common stock, "company common stock") a number of shares of common stock, $.01 par value, of gbc ("new gbc common stock") equal to one-third of the number of shares of company common stock held by such holder; whereas the respective boards of directors of parent, sub and the company have, and parent acting as the sole stockholder of sub has, approved the merger of sub with and into the company (the "merger") following the restructuring (as defined in section 3.03) and the company distribution, and otherwise upon the terms and subject to 6 2 the conditions set forth in this agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of company common stock, other than shares owned directly or indirectly by the company, will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (as defined in section 2.01(c)); whereas as a condition of the willingness of parent to enter into this agreement, those individuals and trusts set forth on schedule a attached to the stockholder agreement (as defined below) and the trustees of the trust (as defined in the stockholder agreement)(collectively, the "principal stockholders"), have entered into a stockholder agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "stockholder agreement") with parent, which provides, among other things, that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, each principal stockholder will vote his, her or its shares of company common stock and the shares of company common stock held by any trust of which such principal stockholder is a trustee (including the trust) in favor of the merger and the approval and adoption of this agreement; whereas the board of directors of the company has approved the terms of the stockholder agreement solely for the purpose of rendering section 203 of the dgcl (as defined in section 1.01) inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby; whereas it is the intention of the parties to this agreement that (a) the company distribution shall qualify as a transaction described in section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), and shall be immediately preceded by a transfer of assets and related liabilities that qualifies as a transaction described in section 351 or section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, (b) the recapitalization of gbc and certain other transactions that are part of the restructuring shall be tax-free transactions under the code and (c) the merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(b) of the code; whereas it is currently anticipated that parent will effect a distribution (the "parent distribution") of the common stock of a subsidiary formed for the purpose, which it is currently anticipated will own parent's thermo king, power generation, energy systems and government operations business units, to its shareholders during the third quarter of 1997, and it is the intention of the 7 3 parties to this agreement that the merger will be consummated prior to the parent distribution; and whereas parent, sub and the company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the merger; now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this agreement, the parties hereto agree

(f) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates for six months after the effective time shall be delivered to parent, upon demand, and any holders of the certificates who have not theretofore complied with this article ii shall thereafter look only to parent for payment of their claim for the shares of parent common stock and cash and dividends or other distributions, if any, pursuant to this article ii.
