certificate of formation in a manner that disproportionately and adversely impacts the class b units; and &#149; the direct transfer or pledge of units, equity securities or other membership interests in crumbs by issuer, subject to certain exceptions described above. the restated llc agreement permits the board of managers of crumbs to authorize cash distributions solely to the issuer without pro rata distributions to the other crumbs members in amounts required for the issuer to pay certain expenses related to its existence as the public holding company of crumbs; provided, however, that the amount of any such distributions are reduced, to the extent practicable, by the amount of unused cash remaining from any prior such distributions, including any interest earned thereon, and no excess cash that results from such distributions may be used by the issuer to make a distribution to its equity holders other than amounts related to certain purchases or redemptions of its equity securities pursuant to the exchange agreement. the restated llc agreement requires the issuer to maintain a reserve consisting of all cash and cash equivalents received with respect to tax distributions that are not used for its operating expenses and requires the issuer to keep crumbs reasonably apprised of the amount of such reserves. the restated llc agreement further provides that, in the event of any merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation of crumbs in which the issuer is a party, involving a payment or distribution of cash, securities or other assets to any member of crumbs, the consideration received by crumbs or by any direct or indirect holders of equity interests in crumbs (including the issuer) in such transaction, net of bona fide expenses of crumbs, will be distributed pro rata with respect to the number of class a units and class b units at the time of such distribution. withholding and other taxes paid or payable by crumbs in respect of the income of or distributions to a member of crumbs will be repaid to crumbs by such member, or crumbs may offset amounts otherwise due to such member by the amount of such withholding taxes paid. under the restated llc agreement, the issuer has the right to appoint crumbs&#146; board of managers, which are the same persons who comprised the issuer&#146;s board of directors after the closing. the chief executive officer of crumbs is the same as the chief executive officer of the issuer and the other officers of crumbs are appointed by the ceo of crumbs. the restated llc agreement contains certain exculpation and indemnification provisions. neither the board members of crumbs nor any officer shall have any liability to crumbs or any crumbs member for any actions taken or omitted to be taken with respect to crumbs, including a breach of fiduciary duty, by such board member or officer, as applicable, subject to certain limitations. the restated llc agreement also sets forth that the restated llc agreement may not be amended without the consent of the holders of class a units and class b units voting as a single class (it is intended that the threshold for such consent is a two thirds of such units). however, any amendment which disproportionately and adversely impacts any member of crumbs must be approved by such member and any amendment which disproportionately and adversely impacts any class of interests must be approved by the holders of such class of interests (it is intended that the threshold for such approval is two thirds). the issuer will consolidate the financial results of crumbs and its subsidiaries, and the ownership interest of the crumbs members in crumbs will be reflected as a non-controlling interest in the issuer&#146;s consolidated financial statements. this summary of the restated llc agreement in this schedule 13d does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the restated llc agreement, which was filed as exhibit 10.1 to the issuer&#146;s current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on may 11, 2011, and is incorporated herein by reference. escrow agreement on may 5, 2011, the issuer, crumbs, the crumbs members, and continental stock transfer &#038;
