consideration ------------------------------------------------- item 3 of the statement is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following: acquisition of series a tci group stock - --------------------------------------- on july 23, 1997, dr. malone purchased 7,284,496 shares of series a tci group stock owned by knight-ridder cablevision, inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $110,068,734.56 or $15.11 per share. prior to this acquisition, the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, had expired with respect to dr. malone's acquisition of such shares. the filing pursuant to said act authorizes dr. malone to acquire up to an aggregate of 49.9999% of the voting power of the issuer. dr. malone acquired such shares with funds he borrowed pursuant to a revolving credit facility with nationsbank of texas, n.a., as agent for the lenders thereof. dr. malone established the revolving credit facility for the acquisition of common stock of the issuer and other business investments. the revolving credit facility is secured by 11,500,000 shares of series b tci group stock and 3,084,358 shares of series b liberty group stock owned by dr. malone. see items 5 and 6 below. copies of the pledge agreement, dated as of july 23, 1997 (the "pledge agreement"), between dr. john c. malone and nationsbank of texas, n.a., as agent, and the revolving credit agreement, dated as of july 23, 1997, among dr. john c. malone, nationsbank of texas, n.a., as agent, and the lenders named therein, are attached hereto as exhibits d and e, respectively, and incorporated herein by this reference. exchange of shares - ------------------ immediately following the above described acquisition and pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement, dated july 23, 1997 (the "letter agreement"), between dr. malone and the issuer, dr. malone transferred to the issuer (a) 7,296,324 shares of series a tci group stock owned by him in exchange for an equal number of shares of series b tci group stock, and (b) 2,278,125 shares of series a liberty group stock owned by him in exchange for an equal number of shares of series b liberty group stock. the issuer made such exchanges in consideration of dr. malone agreeing to forgo his rights to acquire certain shares of issuer common stock owned by kearns-tribune corporation in connection with its merger (as defined below). the terms of the letter agreement provided that dr. malone could acquire up to an additional 1,816,176 shares of series b tci group stock (for an aggregate of 9,112,500 shares of series b tci group stock) by exchanging an equal number of shares of series a tci group stock at any time and from time to time until july 30, 1998. upon the close of the merger, however, dr. malone and the issuer agreed to terminate dr. malone's right to acquire such 1,816,176 shares of series b tci group stock. the foregoing description of the exchanges and the waiver of rights is qualified in its entirety by reference to the letter agreement attached to this amendment no. 3 to the statement as exhibit f and incorporated herein by this reference. waiver of acquisition rights - ---------------------------- on july 31, 1997, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of april 18, 1997, the issuer acquired all of the capital stock of kearns-tribune in connection with the merger of kearns-tribune with a subsidiary of the issuer (the "merger"). pursuant to an agreement entered into in 1988, by the late mr. bob magness and kearns-tribune with dr. malone, dr. malone had been granted certain rights with respect the series b tci group stock and the series b liberty group stock owned by mr. magness and kearns-tribune. in connection with the merger, dr. malone asserted those rights and, in connection therewith, kearns-tribune agreed that dr. malone could exercise those rights immediately prior to the merger. see item 6 below. as stated above, however, dr. malone agreed to forgo exercising those rights in connection with the letter agreement. 5 item 4. purpose of transaction ---------------------- item 4 of the statement is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following: dr. malone acquired the 7,284,496 shares of series a tci group stock and exercised his exchange rights with tci for additional shares of series b tci group stock and series b liberty group stock, all as described in item 3 above, to increase his voting power with respect to the issuer. subject to a number of contingencies, on or about august 8, 1997, the issuer intends to offer to exchange its shares of series a tci ventures group common stock for shares of series a tci group stock and its shares of series b tci ventures group common stock for shares of series b tci group stock. assuming said exchange offer is made, at this time dr. malone intends to tender approximately 30% of his series a tci

security for the obligation collateral of a type described on schedule ii with an adjusted collateral value (as determined herein) in excess of the unpaid principal balance of the obligation. the -5- adjusted collateral value shall be determined by multiplying the collateral value (as defined in subparagraph b below) by the margin call percentage shown on schedule ii. in addition, no advance requested by pledgor shall be made to pledgor if the sum of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the obligation plus (ii) the amount of the advance requested, equals or exceeds the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the collateral value by the original advance percentage for each type of collateral securing the obligation. b. value of collateral. the "collateral value" of collateral shall be determined at any given time as follows: i. if stock, the collateral value shall be determined by multiplying (i) the per share price of such stock at the most recent close of trading on a trading exchange for such stock, times (ii) the number of shares of such stock held by secured party as collateral. in the event that stock held as collateral is not traded on an exchange, the collateral value of such stock shall be determined by obtaining the quoted value of such stock from a reputable brokerage firm selected by secured party. if no such quote is available, the value will be determined by secured party in its sole discretion. ii. if a mutual fund, the collateral value shall be determined by multiplying (i) the most recent per share net asset value of such mutual fund obtained from the wall street journal, times (ii) the number of shares of such mutual fund held by secured party as collateral. in the event that such net asset value is not available in the wall street journal, the collateral value shall be the value quoted to secured party by a reputable brokerage firm selected by secured party. iii. if corporate bonds, the collateral value shall be determined from the most recent closing price for such bonds obtained from the wall street journal. if such closing price is not available in the wall street journal, the collateral value shall be the value quoted to secured party by a reputable brokerage firm selected by secured party. iv. if government or agency obligations or bonds, the collateral value shall be determined from the most recent closing bid price for such bonds obtained from the wall street journal. if such closing bid price is not available in the wall street journal, the collateral value shall be the value quoted to secured party by a reputable brokerage firm selected by secured party. v. if other than stock, mutual funds, corporate bonds, or government or agency obligations or bonds, the collateral value shall be determined by the secured party in its sole discretion. c. breach of collateral maintenance. if pledgor fails to maintain collateral with an adjusted collateral value as set forth above, the pledgor shall have two business days from the date pledgor is notified by secured party (in writing or orally) of such noncompliance, to either pledge additional collateral satisfactory to secured party, in its sole discretion, or reduce the unpaid principal balance of the obligation such that, in either case, the unpaid principal balance of the obligation is less than the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the collateral value by the original advance percentage shown on schedule ii. any reduction in unpaid principal of the obligation shall not affect or reduce any future principal payments due except to the extent such reductions are applied in accordance with the documents evidencing or securing the obligation. in the event pledgor fails to comply with the terms hereof, secured party may, without any further notice of any kind, exercise any of the following rights and remedies, at secured party's option: (a) the rights and remedies set out in section 8.b. of this agreement, including without limitation the right to accelerate the obligation and liquidate the collateral. -6- (b) sell all or any part of the collateral and apply the proceeds of such sale to the obligation to bring the obligation back into compliance (that is, to reduce the unpaid principal of the obligation such that the unpaid principal of the obligation is less than the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the collateral value by the original advance percentage shown on schedule ii. if an event of default exists hereunder and the collateral is declining in value or threatens to decline speedily in value, secured party shall have no obligation to notify pledgor of the failure to maintain collateral with an adjusted collateral value as set forth in subparagraph a above or to provide pledgor with an opportunity to cure such noncompliance, and in such case pledgor agrees that secured party may immediately at secured party's sole option (i) declare amounts due under the obligation to be immediately due and payable, and/or (ii) sell all or any part of the collateral and apply the proceeds of such collateral to the obligation. d. sale or substitution of collateral. if no event of default has occurred under this agreement, pledgor may, provided none of the following actions would result in the occurrence of an event of default: (i) sell, trade, or withdraw any part of the collateral; or (ii) substitute new collateral for existing collateral, provided that, in either event, the new collateral shall be acceptable to secured party in its sole discretion and the unpaid principal balance of the obligation shall be less than the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the collateral value by the original advance percentage for each type of collateral securing the obligation. 7. rights and powers of secured party. a. general. secured party, before or after default, without liability to pledgor may: take control of proceeds, including stock received as dividends or by reason of stock splits; release the collateral in its possession to pledgor, temporarily or otherwise; require additional collateral; and reject as unsatisfactory any property hereafter offered by pledgor as collateral. other than the exercise of reasonable care to ensure the safe custody of the collateral in secured party's possession, secured party shall have no obligation, duty or responsibility for the collateral and specifically, without limiting the foregoing, shall have no obligation, duty or responsibility to collect any amounts payable, or exercise any right or option, in respect of the collateral or to sell all or any portion of the collateral to avoid market loss. secured party shall not be liable for failure to collect any account or instruments, or for any act or omission on the part of secured party, its officers, agents or employees, except for its or their own willful misconduct or gross negligence. the foregoing rights and powers of

after the occurrence of an event of default, secured party may present for conversion any collateral which is convertible into any other instrument or investment security or a combination thereof with

party taking such action; and (ii) prior to the occurrence of an event of default, secured party agrees that it shall not convert (a) tele-communications, inc. ("tci") series b common stock into tci series a common stock; and (b) tci liberty media group series b common stock into tci liberty media group series a common stock. secured party shall have no obligation to present any collateral for conversion. c. voting rights. subject to the following sentence, the pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and/or consensual rights and powers relating or pertaining to the collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement. upon (i) the occurrence after the date hereof of an event of default and (ii) the giving of written notice by secured party to pledgor of its intention to (a) foreclose upon or otherwise dispose of the collateral or (b) exercise its voting rights pertaining to the collateral, all rights of the pledgor to exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and -7- powers which it is entitled to exercise hereunder shall cease, at the option of secured party, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in secured party who shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and/or consensual rights and powers. 8. default. a. event of default. an event of default ("event of default") shall occur if: (a) pledgor or any other obligor on all or part of the obligation shall fail to timely and properly pay or observe, keep or perform any term, covenant, agreement or condition in this agreement or in any other agreement between pledgor and secured party or between secured party and any other obligor on the obligation, including but not limited to any other note or instrument, loan agreement, security agreement, deed of trust, mortgage, promissory note, assignment or other agreement or instrument concerning the obligation; or (b) an event of default shall occur under the loan agreement or any of the other loan documents. pledgor agrees that, among its other covenants and agreements contained herein, the failure to maintain collateral with an adjusted collateral value as set forth in section 6 hereof shall constitute an event of default under this agreement and the loan agreement. b. rights and remedies. if any event of default shall occur, then, in each and every such case, secured party may, without (a) presentment, demand, or protest, (b) notice of default, dishonor, demand, non-payment, or protest, (c) notice of intent to accelerate all or any part of the obligation, (d) notice of acceleration of all or any part of the obligation, or (e) notice of any other kind, all of which pledgor hereby expressly waives (except for any notice required under this agreement, any of the other loan documents or which may not be waived under applicable law), at any time thereafter exercise and/or enforce any of the following rights and remedies, at secured party's option: i. acceleration. declare the obligation immediately due and payable, and the obligation, if any, of secured party to permit further borrowings under the obligation shall at secured party's option immediately cease and terminate. ii. liquidation of collateral. subject to applicable securities laws, sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the collateral in a public or private sale, direct any agent or broker to liquidate all or any part of any account and deliver all proceeds thereof to secured party, and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the obligation in such order and manner as secured party shall, in its discretion, choose. secured party is authorized, at any sale of the collateral, if it deems it advisable, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to those persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to distribution or sale of any of the collateral. secured party shall have no obligation to disclose or provide any information concerning the issuers or the collateral to prospective purchasers of the collateral other than information in its possession at such time. iii. uniform commercial code. all of the rights, powers and remedies of a secured creditor under the uniform commercial code ("ucc") as adopted in the jurisdiction to which secured party is subject under this agreement. pledgor acknowledges and agrees that the collateral is customarily sold on a recognized market and accordingly secured party may sell the collateral without prior notification, advertisement or notice of any kind at any broker's board or securities exchange. iv. right of set off. without notice or demand to pledgor, set off and apply against any and all of the obligation any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and any other indebtedness, at any time held or owing by secured party, by any of the lenders, or by any of their respective affiliates or correspondents to or for the credit of the account of pledgor or any guarantor or indorser of pledgor's obligation. -8- v. additional remedies. without liability to pledgor: take control of funds generated by the collateral, such as cash dividends, interest and proceeds, and use same to reduce any part of the obligation and exercise all other rights which an owner of such collateral may exercise; and at any time transfer any of the collateral or evidence thereof into its own name or that of its nominee. pledgor specifically understands and agrees that any sale by secured party of all or part of the collateral pursuant to the terms of this agreement may be effected by secured party at times and in manners which could result in the proceeds of such sale as being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at different times or in different manners, and pledgor hereby releases secured party and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. if, in the opinion of secured party, there is any question that a public sale or distribution of any collateral will violate any state or federal securities law, secured party may offer and sell such collateral in a transaction exempt from registration under federal securities law, and any such sale made in good faith by secured party shall be deemed "commercially reasonable." 9. general. a. parties bound. secured party's rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of secured party, any of the lenders, and their respective successors and assigns, and in the event of any assignment or transfer of any of the obligation or the collateral, secured party thereafter shall be fully discharged from any responsibility with respect to the collateral so assigned or transferred, but secured party shall retain all rights and powers hereby given with respect to any of the obligation or the collateral not so assigned or transferred. all representations, warranties and agreements of pledgor if more than one are joint and several and all shall be binding upon the personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of pledgor. b. waiver. no delay of secured party in exercising any power or right shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. no waiver by secured party of any right hereunder or of any default by pledgor shall be binding upon secured party unless in writing, and no failure by secured party to exercise any power or right hereunder or waiver of any default by pledgor shall operate as a waiver of any other or further exercise of such right or power or of any further default. each right, power and remedy of secured party as provided for herein or in any of the other loan documents, or which shall now or hereafter exist at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. the exercise or beginning of the exercise by secured party of any one or more of such rights, powers or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by secured party of any or all other such rights, powers or remedies. c. agreement continuing. this agreement shall constitute a continuing agreement applying to all future as well as existing transactions, whether or not of the character contemplated at the date of this agreement, and if all transactions between secured party and pledgor shall be closed at any time, shall be equally applicable to any new transactions thereafter. provisions of this agreement, unless by their terms exclusive, shall be in addition to other agreements between the parties. time is of the essence of this agreement. d. definitions. unless the context indicates otherwise, definitions in the ucc apply to words and phrases in this agreement;

to receive under the loan documents, then such lender shall purchase from the other lenders participations that will cause the purchasing lender to share the excess amount ratably with each other lender. if all or any portion of any excess amount is subsequently recovered from the purchasing lender, then the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of the

level below that which such lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance by an amount reasonably deemed by such lender to be material, then from time to time, within ten (10) days after demand by such lender, borrower shall pay to such lender such additional amount as will adequately compensate such lender for such reduction. a lender will notify borrower of any event of which it has actual knowledge, occurring after the date thereof, which will entitle such lender to compensation pursuant to this section 2.12. no failure by a lender to immediately demand payment of

(d) other activities. agent or any lender may now or in the future be engaged in one or more loan, letter of credit, leasing, or other financing transactions with borrower, act as trustee or depositary for borrower, or otherwise be engaged in other transactions with borrower (collectively, the "other activities") not the subject of the loan documents. without limiting the rights of lenders specifically set forth in the loan documents, neither agent nor any lender is responsible to account to the other lenders for those other activities, and no lender shall have any interest in any other lender's activities, any present or future guaranties by or for the account of borrower that are not contemplated by or included in the loan documents, any present or future offset exercised by agent or any lender in respect of those other activities, any present or future property taken as security for any of those other activities, or any property now or hereafter in agent's or any other lender's possession or control that may be or become security for the obligations of borrower arising under the loan documents by reason of the general description of indebtedness secured or of property contained in any other agreements, documents, or instruments related to any of those other activities (but, if any payments in respect of those guaranties or that property or the proceeds thereof is applied by agent or any lender to reduce the obligation, then each lender is entitled to share ratably in the application as provided in the loan documents). (e) additional pledged shares. the pledge agreement contemplates that, ------------------------- under certain circumstances, borrower may provide additional, or substituted, collateral as security for the obligation, provided that such additional or substituted collateral is satisfactory to agent, in its sole discretion. without the prior written or oral approval of lenders, agent shall not approve as satisfactory additional or substitute collateral, unless such collateral consists of shares of common stock of the same series and issue as the collateral. 8.2 expenses. should agent commence any proceeding or in any way seek to enforce its rights under the loan documents, irrespective of whether as a result thereof agent shall acquire title to any collateral, either through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise, each lender, upon demand therefor from time-to-time, shall contribute its share (based on its pro rata part) of the reasonable costs and/or expenses of any such enforcement or acquisition, including, but not limited to, fees of receivers or trustees, court costs, title company charges, filing and recording fees, appraisers' fees and fees and expenses of attorneys to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by borrower. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each lender shall contribute its share (based on its pro rata part) of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by agent (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) if agent employs counsel for advice or other representation (whether or not any suit has been or shall be filed) with respect to any collateral or any part thereof, or any of the loan documents, or the attempt to enforce any lien in any of the collateral, or to enforce any rights of agent or any of borrower's or any other company's obligations under any of the loan documents, but not with respect to any dispute between agent and any other lender(s). any loss of principal and interest resulting from any potential default or event of default shall be shared by lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata parts. it is understood and agreed that if agent determines that it is necessary to engage counsel for lenders from and after the occurrence of a potential default or default, then said counsel shall be selected by agent and written notice of the same shall be delivered to lenders. 8.3 proportionate absorption of losses. except as otherwise provided in the loan documents, nothing in the loan documents gives any lender any advantage over any other lender insofar as the obligation is concerned or relieves any lender from ratably absorbing any losses sustained with respect to the obligation (except to the extent unilateral actions or inactions by any lender result in borrower or any other obligor on the obligation having any credit, allowance, setoff, defense, or counterclaim solely with respect to all or any part of that lender's pro rata part of the obligation). 8.4 delegation of duties; reliance. lenders may perform any of their duties or exercise any of their rights under the loan documents by or through agent, and lenders and agent may perform any of their duties or exercise any of their rights under the loan documents by or through their respective officers, agents, or other representatives. agent, lenders, and their respective officers, agents, or other representatives (a) are entitled to rely upon (and shall be protected in relying upon) any written or oral statement believed by it or them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or made by the proper person and, with respect to legal matters, upon opinion of counsel selected by agent or that lender (but nothing in this clause (a) permits agent to rely on (i) oral statements if a writing is required by this agreement or (ii) any other writing if a specific writing is required by this agreement), (b) are entitled to deem and treat each lender as the owner and holder of its portion of the obligation for all purposes until, written notice of the assignment or transfer is given to and received by agent (and any request, authorization, consent, or approval of any lender is conclusive and binding on each subsequent holder, assignee, or transferee of or participant in that lender's portion of the obligation until that notice is given and received), (c) are not deemed to have notice of the occurrence of a potential default or event of default unless a responsible officer of agent, who handles matters associated with the loan documents and transactions thereunder, has actual knowledge or agent has been notified by a lender or borrower, and (d) are entitled to consult with legal counsel (including counsel for borrower), independent accountants, and other experts selected by agent and are not liable for any action taken or not taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of counsel, accountants, or experts. 8.5 limitation of agent's liability'. (a) exculpation. neither agent nor any of its affiliates or officers, agents or other representatives will be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under the loan documents in good faith and believed by it or them to be within the discretion or power conferred upon it or them by the loan documents or be responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment (except for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct), and neither agent nor any of its affiliates or officers, agents, or other representatives has a fiduciary relationship with any lender by virtue of the loan documents (but nothing in this agreement negates the obligation of agent to account for funds received by it for the account of any lender). (b) indemnity. unless indemnified to its satisfaction against loss, cost, liability, and expense, agent may not be compelled to do any act under the loan documents or to take any action toward the execution or enforcement of the powers thereby created or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the loan documents. if agent requests instructions from lenders, or the required lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action in connection with any loan document, then agent is entitled to refrain (without incurring any liability to any person by so refraining) from that act or action unless and until it has received instructions. in no event, however, may agent or any of its officers, agents, or other representatives be required to take any action that it or they determine could incur for it or them criminal or onerous civil liability. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no lender has any right of action against agent as a result of agent's acting or refraining from acting under this agreement in accordance with instructions of the required lenders. (c) reliance. agent is not responsible to any lender or any participant for, and each lender represents and warrants that it has not relied upon any agent in respect of, (i) the creditworthiness of borrower and the risks involved to that lender, (ii) the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity, or the due execution of any loan document (except by agent), (iii) any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report, or statement made therein (except by agent) or furnished thereunder or in connection therewith, (iv) the adequacy of any collateral now or hereafter securing the obligation or the existence, priority, or perfection of any lien now or hereafter granted or purported to be granted on the collateral under any loan document, or (v) observation of or compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of any loan document on the part of borrower. each lender agrees to indemnify agent and its officers, agents, and other representatives and hold them harmless from and against (but limited to such lender's pro rata part) any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses, and reasonable disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, asserted against, or incurred by them in any way relating to or arising out of the loan documents or any action taken or omitted by them under the loan documents if such agent and its officers, agents or other representatives are not reimbursed for such amounts by borrower. although agent and its officers, agents, and other representatives have the right to be indemnified under this agreement for its or their own ordinary negligence, agent and its officers, agents, and other representatives do not have the right to be indemnified under this agreement for its or their own fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. 8.6 default. while an event of default exists, lenders agree to promptly confer in order that the required lenders or lenders, as the case may be, may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the rights of lenders. agent is entitled to act or refrain from taking any action (without incurring any liability to any person for so acting or refraining) unless and until it has received instructions from required lenders or all lenders, as the case may be. in actions with respect to any of borrower's property, agent is acting for the ratable benefit of each lender. 8.7 collateral matters. (a) each lender authorizes and directs agent to enter into the loan documents and agrees that any action taken by agent concerning any collateral (with the consent or at the request of the required lenders) in accordance with any loan document, that agent's exercise (with the consent or at the request of the required lenders) of powers concerning the collateral in any loan document, and that all other reasonably incidental powers are authorized and binding upon all lenders. (b) agent is authorized on behalf of all lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any lender, from time-to-time before a potential default or event of default, to take any action with respect to any collateral or loan documents related to collateral that may be necessary to perfect and maintain agent's liens in the collateral. (c) except to use the same standard of care that it ordinarily uses for collateral for its sole benefit, agent has no obligation whatsoever to any lender or to any other person to assure that the collateral exists or is owned by borrower or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered or that agent's liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority. (d) agent shall exercise the same care and prudent judgment with respect to the collateral and the loan documents as it normally and customarily exercises in respect of similar collateral and security documents. 8.8 limitation of liability. no lender or any participant will incur any liability to any other lender or participant except for acts or omissions in bad faith, and neither agent nor any lender or participant will incur any liability to any other person for any act or omission of any other lender or any participant. 8.9. relationship of lenders. the loan documents do not create a partnership or joint venture among agent and lenders or among lenders. 8.10. benefits of agreement. none of the provisions of this section inure to the benefit of borrower or any other person except agent and lenders. therefore, neither borrower nor any other person is responsible or liable for, entitled to rely upon, or entitled to raise as a defense -- in any manner whatsoever -- the failure of agent or any lender to comply with these provisions. section 9. miscellaneous. 9.1 accounting reports. all financial reports or projections, furnished by any person to agent and lenders pursuant to this agreement shall be prepared in such form and such detail as shall be satisfactory to agent, shall be prepared on the same basis as those prepared by such person in prior years. 9.2 waiver. no failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of agent or lenders, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. the rights of agent and lenders under the loan documents shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law. no modification or waiver of any provision of any loan document, nor consent to departure therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing, and no such consent or waiver shall extend beyond the particular case and purpose involved. no notice or demand given in any case shall constitute a waiver of the right to take other action in the same, similar or other instances without such notice or demand. 9.3 payment of expenses. borrower hereby agrees to pay on demand: (a) all reasonable costs and expenses of agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, and delivery of this agreement and the other loan documents including, without limitation, the reasonable legal fees and expenses of legal counsel for agent; (b) all reasonable costs and expenses of agent in connection with any and all amendments, modifications, renewals, extension, and supplements of any of the loan documents; (c) all reasonable costs and expenses of agent and lenders in connection with any event of default and the enforcement of this agreement or any other loan document, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal counsel for agent and lenders; (d) all transfer, stamp, documentary, or other similar taxes, assessments, or charges levied by any governmental authority in respect of this agreement or any of the other loan documents; (e) all costs, expenses, assessments, and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording, or perfection of any security interest or lien contemplated by this agreement or any other loan document; and (f) all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by agent in connection with this agreement or any other loan document. 9.4 notices. any communications required or permitted to be given by any of the loan documents must be (a) in writing and personally delivered or mailed by prepaid certified or registered mail or by reputable overnight courier, or (b) made by facsimile transmission delivered or transmitted, to the party to whom such notice of communication is directed, to the address of such party shown opposite its name on the signature pages hereof. any such communication shall be deemed to have been given (whether actually received or not) on the day it is personally delivered or, if transmitted by facsimile transmission, on the day that such communication is transmitted as aforesaid subject to telephone confirmation of receipt; provided, however, that any notice received by agent after 1:00 p.m. dallas, texas time on any day from borrower pursuant to section 2.2 or 2.3 (with respect to a notice of borrowing) shall be deemed for the purposes of such section to have been given by borrower on the next succeeding day, or if mailed, on the third day after it is marked as aforesaid. any party may change its address for purposes of this agreement by giving notice of such change to the other parties pursuant to this section 9.4. 9.5 governing law. this agreement has been prepared, is being executed and delivered, and is intended to be performed in the state of texas, and the substantive laws of such state and the applicable federal laws of the united states of america shall govern the validity, construction, enforcement, and interpretation of this agreement and all of the other loan documents. 9.6 choice of forum; consent to service of process and jurisdiction. any suit, action, or proceeding against borrower with respect to this agreement, the notes, or any judgment entered by any court in respect thereof, may be brought in the courts of the state of texas, county of dallas, or in the united states courts located in the state of texas, as agent and lenders in their sole discretion may elect and borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such suit, action, or proceeding. 9.7 invalid provisions. any provision of any loan document held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable shall not invalidate the remaining provisions of such loan document, which shall remain in full force, and the effect thereof shall be confined to the provision held invalid or illegal. 9.8 maximum interest rate. regardless of any provision contained in any of the loan documents, neither agent nor any lender shall ever be entitled to receive, collect, or apply as interest on the notes any amount in excess of interest calculated at the maximum rate, and, in the event that any agent or any lender ever receives, collects, or applies as interest any such excess, the amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed to be a partial prepayment of principal, and treated hereunder as such; and, if the principal amount of the obligation is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to borrower. in determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds interest calculated at the maximum rate, borrower and lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (a) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium, rather than as interest; (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof; and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the note; provided that, if the notes are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds interest calculated at the maximum rate, agent and lenders shall refund to borrower the amount of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the principal amount of the notes, and, in such event, agent and lenders shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving, or receiving interest in excess of interest calculated at the maximum rate. 9.9 nonliability of lenders. the relationship between borrower and lenders is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrower and lenders, and lenders have no fiduciary or other special relationship with borrower. 9.10 article 15.10(b). borrower, agent, and lenders hereby agree that, except for section 15.10(b) thereof, the provisions of art. 5069-15.01 et seq. of the revised civil statutes of texas, 1925, as amended (regulating certain revolving credit loans and revolving tri-party accounts) shall not apply to the loan documents. 9.11 successors and assigns. (a) this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of agent and all lenders. any lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other institutions in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its commitments and the advances owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such lender's obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents (including, without limitation, its commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such lender shall remain solely responsible to borrower for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such lender shall remain the holder of its notes for all purposes of this agreement, (iv) borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with such lender in connection with such lender's rights and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents, and (v) such lender shall not sell a participation that conveys to the participant the right to vote or give or withhold consents under this agreement or any other loan document, other than the right to vote upon or consent to (a) any increase of such lender's commitments, (b) any reduction of the principal amount of, or interest to be paid on, the advances of such lender, (c) any reduction of any commitment fee or other amount payable to such bank under any loan document, or (d) any postponement of any date for the payment of any amount payable in respect of the advances of such lender. (b) borrower and lenders agree that any lender (an "assigning lender") may at any time assign to one or more eligible assignees all, or a portion of all, of its rights and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents (including, without limitation, its commitment and advances) (each an "assignee"); provided, however, that (i) except in the case of an assignment of all of a lender's rights and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents, the amount of the commitments of the assigning lender being assigned pursuant to each assignment (determined as of the date of the assignment and acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $25,000,000.00, (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to agent for its acceptance and recording in the register (as defined below), an assignment and acceptance, together with the note subject to such assignment, and a processing and recordation fee of $3,000.00; and (iii) agent and borrower consent to the assignment (and with respect to borrower, borrower furnishes written evidence of its consent to agent), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. upon such execution, delivery, acceptance, and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each assignment and acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five (5) business days after the execution thereof, or, if so specified in such assignment and acceptance, the date of acceptance thereof by agent, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto as a "lender" and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such assignment and acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a lender hereunder and under the loan documents and (y) the lender that is an assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment and acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents (and, in the case of an assignment and acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a lender's rights and obligations under the loan documents, such lender shall cease to be a party thereto). (c) by executing and delivering an assignment and acceptance, the assigning lender and its assignee confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such assignment and acceptance, such assigning lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties, or representations made in or in connection with the loan documents or the execution, legality, validity, and enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of the loan documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such assigning lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of borrower or the performance or observance by borrower of its obligations under the loan documents; (iii) the assignee confirms that it has received copies of the loan documents, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in section 5.7 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such assignment and acceptance; (iv) the assignee will, independently and without reliance upon agent or such assignor and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this agreement and the other loan documents; (v) the assignee confirms that it is an eligible assignee; (vi) the assignee appoints and authorizes agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and exercise such powers under the loan documents as are delegated to agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) the assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of the loan documents are required to be performed by it as a lender. (d) agent shall maintain at its principal office a copy of each assignment and acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of lenders and the commitment of, and principal amount of the advances owing to, each lender from time-to-time (the "register"). the entries in the register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and borrower, agent, and lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the register as a lender hereunder for all purposes under the loan documents. the register shall be available for inspection by borrower or any lender at any reasonable time and from time-to- time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) upon its receipt of an assignment and acceptance executed by an assigning lender and assignee representing that it is an eligible assignee (or other assignee permitted hereunder), together with any note subject to such assignment, agent shall, if such assignment and acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of exhibit a, (i) accept such assignment and acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the register, and (iii) give prompt written notice thereof to borrower. within five (5) business days after its receipt of such notice, borrower shall execute and deliver to agent in exchange for the surrendered note a new note to the order of such eligible assignee (or other assignee permitted hereunder) in an amount equal to the portion of the commitments assumed by it pursuant to such assignment and acceptance and, if the assigning lender has retained a portion of the commitments, a new note to the order of the assigning lender in an amount equal to the portion of the commitments retained by it hereunder (each such promissory note shall constitute a "note" for purposes of the loan documents). such new notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the surrendered note, shall be dated the effective date of such assignment and acceptance, and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of exhibit b. (f) any lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this section, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to borrower furnished to such, lender by or on behalf of borrower, subject to the confidentiality requirements in section 9.19. (g) notwithstanding any other term of this agreement to the contrary, any lender may (without requesting the consent of either agent or borrower) pledge its note to a federal reserve bank in support of borrowings made by such lender from such federal reserve bank. (h) notwithstanding any other term of this agreement to the contrary, any lender may assign all, or a portion of all, of its rights and obligations under this agreement and the other loan documents (including, without limitation, its commitment and advances) to an affiliate of such lender or any other lender, provided that: (i) such assignor lender has obtained the written consent of agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) if the effect of such assignment or delegation shall entitle such affiliate or other lender to claim compensation from borrower pursuant to section 2.6 and exhibit d; and (ii) in every other case, such assignor lender has furnished notice to, but not obtained the consent of, agent. 9.12 entirety. this agreement, the note, and the other loan documents referred to herein embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto, and supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof, and may not be contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or discussions of the parties hereto. there are no oral agreements among the parties hereto. the provisions of this agreement and the other loan documents to which borrower is a party may be amended or waived only by an instrument in writing, signed by the parties hereto. 9.13 headings. section headings are for convenience of reference only, and shall in no way affect the interpretation of this agreement. 9.14 survival. all representations and warranties made by borrower herein shall survive delivery of the note and the making of the loan. 9.15 amendments, etc. no amendment or waiver of any provision of this agreement, the notes, or any other loan document to which borrower is a party, nor any consent to any departure by borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be agreed or consented to by the required lenders and borrower, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;

the unpaid principal amount of, and accrued unpaid interest on, this note is payable in accordance with the loan agreement, but not later than the termination date. 4. the unpaid principal balance

(i) amount of prime rate borrowing: . -------------- [ ] borrowing [ ] rollover/conversion (ii) date of borrowing or rollover/conversion of existing borrowing: -------------- b. eurodollar borrowing. (i) amount of eurodollar borrowing: . -------------- [ ] borrowing [ ] rollover/conversion (ii) date of borrowing or rollover/conversion of existing borrowing: -------------- (iii) interest period: -------------- day/months (one, two, three, four, or six months). 3. representations, warranties and certifications. borrower hereby represents, warrants, and certifies to agent and lenders that, as of the date of the advance requested herein: (a) there exists no potential default or event of default; (b) the borrower has performed and complied with all agreements and conditions contained in the agreement that are required to be performed or complied with by the borrower; and (c) the representations and warranties of a continuing nature contained in the agreement and each of the other loan documents are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that they speak to a specific date or are based on facts which have changed by transactions expressly contemplated or permitted by the credit agreement), with the same force and effect as though made on and as of the date of the advance. 4. proceeds of borrowing. agent is authorized to deposit the proceeds of the advance requested hereby, other than an advance constituting a rollover or conversion of an existing advance, to: ____________________________________. 5. execution authorized. this notice of borrowing is executed on ________, 19__. the undersigned hereby certifies the accuracy of the foregoing. -------------------------------------- john c. malone exhibit d eurodollar advances ------------------- (a) inadequacy of eurodollar pricing. if with respect to an interest period for any eurodollar advance: (i) agent determines that the basis for determining the eurodollar rate is not available; or (ii) a lender reasonably determines that the eurodollar rate as determined by agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such lender of maintaining or funding the eurodollar advance for such interest period; then (a) in the case of (i), agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to borrower and lenders of that determination (which is presumed to be correct in the absence of manifest error), all advances shall be prime rate advances, and until agent notifies borrower and lenders that such circumstances no longer exist, lenders' commitments under this agreement to make, or convert to, eurodollar advances shall be suspended, and (b) in the case of (ii), such lender shall forthwith give notice thereof to agent and borrower, the obligation of such lender to make eurodollar advances shall be suspended, borrower shall, at its option, either (i) repay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of all eurodollar advances, together with accrued interest thereon on the last day of the then current interest period applicable to such eurodollar advances, or (ii) convert such eurodollar advances to prime rate advances in accordance with section 2.3(c) of this agreement on the last day of the then-current interest period applicable to each such eurodollar advance, and until such lender notifies agent and borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, such lender's commitment under this agreement to make, or convert to, eurodollar advances shall be suspended. (b) illegality of eurodollar advances. if, after the date of this agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by agent or any lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any lender to make, maintain, or fund its eurodollar advances, then such lender shall forthwith give notice thereof to agent and borrower. before giving any notice pursuant to this subsection, such lender shall designate a different eurodollar lending office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to any non-trivial extent to such lender (as determined in good faith by such lender). upon receipt of such notice, borrower shall either (i) repay in full the then- outstanding principal amount of any of such lender's eurodollar advances, together with accrued interest thereon, or (ii) convert such lender's eurodollar advances to prime rate advances, on either (a) the last day of the then current interest period applicable to such eurodollar advance, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such eurodollar advance to such day, or (b) immediately, if such lender may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such eurodollar advance to such day. (c) increased costs for eurodollar advances. if, after the date hereof, any governmental authority, central bank, or other comparable authority, shall at any time impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the board of governors of the federal reserve system, and any reserve requirement included in the eurodollar reserve requirement), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with, or for the account of, or credit extended by, any lender, or shall impose on any lender (or its applicable lending office) or the interbank eurodollar market any other condition affecting its eurodollar advances, the notes or such lender's obligation to make eurodollar advances; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such lender of making or maintaining its eurodollar advances, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such lender under this agreement, or under such lender's note, by an amount deemed by such lender to be material, then, within five (5) days after demand by such lender, borrower shall pay to agent, for the account of such lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender for such increased reserve, cost or reduction. such lender will (i) notify agent and borrower of any event occurring after the date of this agreement which will entitle such lender to compensation pursuant to this section, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 120 days) after such lender obtains actual knowledge of such event, and borrower shall not be liable for any such increased costs that accrue between the date such notification is required to be given and the date it was actually given, and (ii) use good faith and reasonable efforts to designate an applicable lending office for eurodollar advances of such lender, if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation, and will not, in the sole opinion of such lender, be disadvantageous to such lender (provided that such lender shall have no obligation to so designate a lending office located in the united states of america). a certificate of such lender claiming compensation under this section and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be presumed to be correct in the absence of manifest error. if a lender demands compensation under this section, then borrower may at any time, upon at least five (5) business days' prior notice to such lender and agent, either (i) repay in full the then outstanding eurodollar advances to such lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, or (ii) convert such eurodollar advances to prime rate advances in accordance with the provisions of this agreement; provided, however, that borrower shall be liable for any funding loss arising pursuant to such actions. (d) effect on prime rate advances. if notice has been given pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, requiring the eurodollar advances to be repaid or converted, then unless and until agent notifies borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such repayment no longer apply, all advances shall be prime rate advances. if agent notifies borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such repayment no longer apply, borrower may thereafter select advances to be eurodollar advances in accordance with section 2.3(c) of this agreement. (e) funding losses. borrower shall indemnify agent and each lender against any loss or reasonable expense (such loss or expense is referred to herein as a "funding loss," such term including, but not limited to, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or reemploying deposits from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such advance or any part thereof as a eurodollar advance) which agent or any lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) any failure by borrower to fulfill on the date of any advance hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in section 4, (ii) any failure by borrower to borrow hereunder or to convert advances hereunder after a notice of borrowing has been given, (iii) any payment, prepayment, or conversion of a eurodollar advance required or permitted by any other provisions of this agreement, including, without limitation, payments made due to the acceleration of the maturity of advances pursuant to section 7.2, or otherwise made on a date other than the last day of the applicable interest period other than pursuant to section (a)(ii) of this exhibit, (iv) any default in the payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any advance or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, by notice of prepayment or otherwise), or (v) the occurrence of an event of default. the term "funding loss" includes, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess, if any, as determined by agent or any lender of (a) its cost of obtaining the funds for the advance being paid, prepaid, or converted or not borrowed or converted (based on the adjusted eurodollar rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, or conversion or failure to borrow or convert to the last day of the interest period for such advance (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or convert, the interest period for the advance which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow or convert) over (b) the amount of interest (as estimated by agent or such lender) that would be realized by agent or such lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, or converted or not borrowed or converted for such period or interest period, as the case may be. a certificate of agent or such lender setting forth any amount or amounts which agent or such lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this paragraph (e), together with a description in reasonable detail of the manner in which such amounts have been calculated, shall be delivered to borrower and shall be presumed to be correct in the absence of manifest error. borrower shall pay to agent, for itself or for the account of any such lender, the amount shown as due on any certificate within five (5) days after its receipt of the same. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall lender be permitted to receive any compensation hereunder constituting interest in excess of the maximum rate. exhibit e closing conditions ------------------ unless otherwise specified, all dated as of july 23, 1997, or a date (a "current date") within 30 days before the closing date. h&b [[1.] revolving credit agreement (the "loan agreement") dated as of july 23, 1997, between john c. malone, ("borrower"), certain lenders defined therein (the "lenders"), nationsbank of texas, n.a., as agent for the lenders, and toronto dominion securities (usa), inc., as co-agent for the lenders -- all the terms of which or incorporated in which have the same meanings when used in this schedule -- to which must be attached: exhibit a - form of assignment and acceptance exhibit b - form of revolving credit note exhibit c - form of notice of borrowing exhibit d - eurodollar requirements exhibit e - closing list exhibit f - initial collateral exhibit g - litigation h&b 2. revolving credit note in the total stated principal amount of $80,000,000.00, executed by borrower, payable to nationsbank of texas, n.a., in substantially the form of exhibit b to the loan agreement. h&b 3. revolving credit note in the total stated principal amount of $50,000,000.00, executed by borrower, payable to toronto dominion (texas), inc., in substantially the form of exhibit b to the loan agreement. h&b [4.] pledge agreement executed by borrower and agent. h&b 5. rule 144 rider executed by borrower, substantially in the form of rider 1 to the pledge agreement. borrower 6. stock certificates: 11,500,000 shares of tele-communications, inc. series b tci group common stock in the name of "john c. malone," cusip number 87924v200;

----------------------- new castle county, state of delaware) (the "consolidated action"). the defendants named in the designated complaint in the consolidated action included qvc and its then directors (barry diller, bruce r. ramer, linda j wachner, william f. costello, j. bruce llewellyn, brian l. roberts, ralph j. roberts and joseph m. segal). in their designated complaint in the consolidated action, plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the qvc directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to take all possible steps to seek out and encourage the best offer for qvc following the announcement by comcast of a merger proposal to acquire qvc. plaintiffs sought, among other things, an injunction ordering the defendants to auction qvc and an award of unspecified damages to the members of the plaintiff class. on july 22, 1994, comcast and liberty made a merger proposal to qvc in order to acquire the remaining shares of qvc common stock that comcast and liberty collectively did not already own. during early august 1994, counsel for the plaintiffs in the consolidated action advised counsel for liberty that they were preparing to amend the designated complaint to name comcast and liberty as defendants. on august 3-4, 1994, plaintiffs' counsel negotiated with counsel for liberty with respect to a proposed increase in the consideration to be paid to qvc's public shareholders as well as the accelerated payment of such consideration, as bases for the possible settlement of the consolidated action. on august 5, plaintiffs, defendants, comcast and liberty executed a memorandum of understanding which contemplated the settlement and dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated action. on august 4, 1994, comcast, liberty, qvc programming holdings, inc. and the company executed a merger agreement which, among other things, reflected the parties' agreement to the terms and transactions contemplated by the memorandum of understanding. on august 19, 1994, as contemplated by the memorandum of understanding, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the delaware court of chancery against qvc, the company's directors, comcast and liberty. the settlement of the consolidated action was approved by the delaware court of chancery on february 5, 1997 and will result in the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated action, and a complete release of all claims, known or unknown, arising out of or related to the acts, transactions or occurrences that are alleged in the consolidated action. defendants in the consolidated action have entered into the memorandum of understanding and have entered into the stipulation of settlement for the consolidated action solely because the proposed settlement would eliminate the distraction, burden and expense of the litigation. this represents the final resolution of this matter, and accordingly, it will not be reported in future filings. 3. in re liberty media corporation shareholder litigation, cons. c.a. no. ------------------------------------------------------ 13168 (del. ch.). in october 1993, after the announcement that liberty would recombine with tci through the mergers of tcic and liberty with subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, seven putative class action lawsuits were filed by liberty stockholders in the court of chancery of the state of delaware (the "delaware chancery court") on behalf of unspecified classes of the holders of liberty common stock (other than defendants). the original defendants included certain directors of liberty (bob magness, john c. malone, peter r. barton, h.f. lenfest, robert l. johnson and paul a. gould), liberty and tci. these actions were consolidated by the delaware chancery court on october 27, 1993 under the caption in re liberty ------------- media corporation shareholder litigation, cons. c.a. no. 13168 (the "liberty - ---------------------------------------- stockholder action"). on december 21, 1994, plaintiffs were permitted by the delaware chancery court to file a second consolidated amended complaint against the defendants named in the pending complaint and liberty directors david wargo and david rapley. the pending complaint is on behalf of a putative class consisting of all holders of liberty common stock (except the defendants and their affiliates) from and after october 7, 1993 through the date of the tci/liberty combination. plaintiffs alleged that the liberty stockholders received inadequate consideration in the tci/liberty combination, that the defendants impeded the ability of third parties to seek to acquire liberty, and that the defendants failed to conduct an auction or market check following the announcement of the proposed tci/liberty combination. plaintiffs sought to rescind the tci/liberty combination, to require defendants to take all appropriate steps to enhance liberty's value as an acquisition candidate, to account to the plaintiff class for all profits obtained by defendants, and to require defendants to pay unspecified damages to the plaintiff class. in february 1997, the parties to the action reached an agreement, in principle, to settle the litigation in exchange for the payment by tci of (i) $44 million (in tci group stock or cash) to the liberty stockholders at the time of the tci/liberty combination and (ii) fees for plaintiffs' counsel. formal settlement papers are expected to be filed with the delaware chancery court by april 30, 1997. this represents the final resolution of this matter, and accordingly, it will not be reported in future filings. 4. james dalton, et al. v. tele-communications, inc., et al. on february --------------------------------------------------------- 24, 1997, james dalton, et al. filed suit in district court for arapahoe county, colorado, case no. 97-cv421, against tele-communications, inc. ("tci") and certain officers of tci. plaintiffs filed this action under the colorado securities act and colorado common law on behalf of all persons who purchased tci securities from january 10, 1996 through october 24, 1996 ("the class period"). plaintiffs claim, in part, that the defendants made false and misleading statements during the class period concerning tci's revenue and cash flow growth, subscriber growth, and expansion and diversification into a multi- business platform; and that tci failed to disclose the performance of its various operations. plaintiffs claim further, in part, that tci's cash flow growth was weak and below levels necessary to fund a multi-business diversification program and that tci was competitively disadvantaged and would likely be threatened by adverse conditions impacting its business. plaintiffs are seeking nationwide class certification and claim that the amount in controversy is less than $75,000 per named plaintiff, exclusive of interest and costs. tci intends to defend such claims vigorously. based upon the facts available, management believes that, although no assurances can be given as to the outcome of this action, the ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the company. ex-7.(f) 4 letter agreement, dated july 23, 1997 exhibit 7(f) july 23, 1997 dr. john c. malone dear dr. malone: reference is made to (i) the agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), dated as of april 18, 1997, among tele-communications, inc.
