collectively sell 2,700,000 shares to herbert tabin, a managing partner with millennium, for $1,500,000 (approximately $0.56 per share) in a second private placement arranged by millennium. as a further condition to the initial investors' obligations under the stock purchase agreement, the selling shareholders granted the company a put option, expiring forty-five (45) days after the closing date, giving the company the right to require the selling shareholders to purchase substantially all of the company's operating assets and liabilities (the "company assets") and substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of vercom software, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation of the company ("vercom") (the "vercom assets"; the company assets and the vercom assets shall collectively be referred to as the "assets") for $3,000,000. the assets include all of the operating assets related to the company's business as currently conducted. during this 45-day period, the company will determine the value of the assets and evaluate whether it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders for the company to sell the assets to the selling shareholders at the put price, to sell the assets to a third party, to retain the assets or to take other appropriate action. in order to facilitate the company's potential exercise of the put option, the company contributed the company assets to a recently formed wholly owned subsidiary corporation, network systems international of north carolina, inc. on july 20, 2000. as part of this process, the company assigned its rights and obligation under substantially all of its current agreements (including its software license agreements, service agreements and employment agreements) to network systems

(120) days, for the remaining purchase price. the selling shareholders will pledge all of their remaining 2,925,856 shares of the company's common stock (the "pledged shares") as security for the payment of the promissory note. the company's right to exercise the put option will be conditioned upon the company using $2,000,000 of the sales price received for the assets to reduce the obligation under the revolving credit arrangement with wachovia. the company plans to use $1,250,000 from the selling shareholders' initial cash payment and $750,000 from the sale, if any, of the pledged shares to reduce the outstanding indebtedness. the sale of the pledged shares is discussed below. as a further condition to the company's right to exercise the put option, the company will also agree to

shareholders. the company understands that millennium will use its best efforts to place the pledged shares with accredited investors on behalf of the selling shareholders for at least $1,500,000, or approximately $0.513 per share. millennium will remit the proceeds generated by the sale of the pledged shares, up to $1,500,000, to the company to satisfy the remaining balance of the purchase price for the assets. if all of the pledged shares are sold for an amount greater than $1,500,000, millennium will retain the excess. if millennium cannot sell all of the pledged shares for at least $1,500,000, millennium will use its best efforts to place as many of the pledged shares as possible with accredited investors on behalf of the selling shareholders for approximately $0.513 per share. pursuant to the terms of the put option, the company will use the first $750,000 from the sale of the pledged shares to reduce the obligation under the revolving credit arrangement with wachovia. if millennium is unable to sell all of the pledged shares, the company will extinguish the promissory note at maturity and retain any remaining shares in satisfaction of the outstanding purchase price
