attached hereto sets forth certain additional information with respect to each director and each executive officer of ect and enron. the filing of this statement on schedule 13d shall not be construed as an admission that enron or ect or any 1 person listed on schedule i hereto is, for the purposes of section 13(d) or 13(g) of the securities exchange act of 1934, the beneficial owner of any securities covered by this statement. neither of the reporting entities nor, to their knowledge, any person listed on schedule i hereto, has been, during the last five years (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violation of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, u.s. federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. under the terms of a subscription agreement dated july 16, 1997, between ect and the issuer (the "subscription agreement"), ect purchased from the issuer the following securities for a cash purchase price of $21,000,000: (a) 15,000 series i 10% convertible redeemable preference shares (initially convertible into an aggregate of 3,750,000 shares of common stock) (the "preference shares"); (b) 3,000,000 shares of common stock; (c) a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock; and (d) an additional warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock (collectively, the "securities"). the source of the purchase price was working capital of enron and ect. ect also received 750,000 shares of common stock from a subsidiary of the issuer pursuant to the fee agreement described in item 6. below. item 4. purpose of transaction. the transactions described in item 3. above occurred as a result of negotiations with the issuer. the securities purchased by ect were acquired for investment purposes. ect intends to review its investment in the issuer on an ongoing basis and, depending upon the price of, and other 2 market conditions relating to, the common stock, subsequent developments affecting the issuer, the issuer's business and prospects, other investment and business opportunities available to ect, general stock market and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors deemed relevant, may decide to increase or decrease the size of its investment in the issuer. other than as described above, neither of the reporting entities, nor, to their knowledge, any person listed on schedule i hereto, has any plan or proposal that would result in any of the consequences listed in paragraphs (a) - (j) of item 4. of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. ect beneficially owns and has the power to vote and dispose of 9,000,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 33.45% of the shares of common stock outstanding (determined in accordance with rule 13d-3). because ect is a wholly owned subsidiary of enron, enron may also be deemed to beneficially own such shares. enron disclaims beneficial ownership of all of such shares. of these 9,000,000 shares, (a) 3,750,000 are currently outstanding; (b) 3,750,000 are issuable on conversion of the preference shares; (c) 1,000,000 are issuable on exercise of the warrant; and (d) 500,000 are issuable on the exercise of the additional warrant. the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion or exercise of the preference shares, the warrant and the additional warrant is subject to adjustment pursuant to customary antidilution provisions included in the terms of such securities. the rights and preferences of the preference shares are set forth in the articles of amendment to the issuer's charter document (the "articles of amendment"). under the subscription agreement and the fee agreement described in item 6. below, the issuer may be obligated to issue to ect, without the payment by ect of additional consideration, an indeterminate number of additional shares of common stock, based 3 upon the market prices for the common stock during the 30 days preceding october 15, 1997. except as described herein, neither of the reporting entities, nor, to their knowledge, any of the persons named in schedule i hereto, has effected any transactions in the common stock during the past sixty days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. at the closing of the purchase and sale of securities (the "closing"), the issuer and ect entered into a registration rights agreement obligating the issuer to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to all shares of common stock held by or issuable to ect in connection with the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement. under the terms of the subscription agreement, in the event the trade weighted average share price of the common stock during the 30-day period immediately preceding october 15, 1997, is less than $2.00 per share, the issuer will pay to ect a sum (the "makewhole amount") equal to the product of such difference and 3,000,000. the makewhole amount is payable at the option of the issuer in cash or additional shares of common stock on october 15, 1997. the issuer also agreed in the subscription agreement not to (a) issue or sell shares of its common stock at a price less than 85% of the average price (as defined) or to sell any securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock with a conversion or exercise price that is less than 85% of the average price on the date of issuance of the convertible or exchangeable securities or (b) sell more than $10,000,000 of common stock at prices less than the average price as of the date of the related sale. the issuer also agreed that upon the request of ect, subject to compliance 4 with applicable laws, issuer will expand the number of directors constituting the entire board of directors of the issuer by one and fill the vacancy created by such expansion with a designee of ect reasonably acceptable to issuer and to submit the name of such designee to the shareholders of the issuer at each meeting of the shareholders at which directors are elected, until requested otherwise by ect. the issuer has granted to ect the right to purchase shares of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) sufficient to maintain its proportionate interest in the issuer, on the same terms as those pursuant to which the issuer proposes to issue such additional securities. the provisions described in this paragraph terminate on the date ect and its affiliates beneficially own less than 10% of the common stock. at the closing, samarac corporation, the holder of approximately 55% of the outstanding common stock immediately prior to closing, executed a shareholder agreement pursuant to which it agreed with ect that it would not sell more than 5% of such shares of common stock during any twelve-month period occurring during the three years following the closing and to vote its common stock in favor of any nominee for director designated by ect (as described above). the holders of the preference shares may require that such shares be redeemed by the issuer in circumstances specified in the articles of amendment, at a redemption price of $1,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. kenneth f. swaisland, the president of the issuer, has executed a non- transferable guaranty in favor of ect, guaranteeing the performance by the issuer of its obligation to redeem preference shares in accordance with the terms of the articles of amendment. ect has granted to the issuer an option to purchase up to 5,000 preference shares prior to january 16, 1998 (the "determination date") at a cash purchase price of $1,200 per share. the option may be exercised only if the trade weighted average of prices for the common stock 5 during a period of 30 consecutive days exceeds $7.00 per share and the common stock is listed on a u.s. national securities exchange or the nasdaq national market. the issuer's option expires on the determination date. at the closing, ect also entered into a consulting services agreement with the canfibre group, ltd. ("canfibre"), a subsidiary of the issuer. under the terms of the consulting services agreement, ect will, from time to time, as requested by canfibre, provide consultation services and advice with respect to the operations and properties of canfibre through july 15, 2007. ect is entitled to an annual fee for its services in an amount equal to a sum equivalent to 5% of the after-tax distributable operating cash flow of canfibre, calculated on the basis of audited financial statements. canfibre and ect also entered into a fee agreement pursuant to which canfibre conveyed to ect 750,000 shares of common stock owned by canfibre and agreed that if the trade weighted average of the common stock for the 30-day period prior to october 15, 1997 is less than $2.00 per share, canfibre will pay to ect an amount equal to the product of such difference and 750,000, payable at the option of canfibre in cash or in additional shares of common stock. concurrently with the purchase of the securities, ect and canfibre of riverside, inc., a california corporation and a subsidiary of canfibre ("canfibre of riverside"), entered into a subordinated loan agreement (the "loan agreement") pursuant to which ect agreed to lend up to $15,000,000 to canfibre of riverside. the loan is subordinated to senior indebtedness (as defined in the loan agreement) and is secured by subordinated lien on certain assets of canfibre of riverside. in connection with the subordinated loan, ect and canfibre of riverside entered into an income participation purchase agreement entitling ect to receive a specified percentage of the free cash flow (as defined) of canfibre of riverside. upon any default under the loan 6 agreement or one year after the completion of the construction of a specified manufacturing facility of canfibre of riverside, ect has the option to require the issuer to purchase the income participation certificate for $12,500,000 (as adjusted for payments previously received from canfibre of riverside under the income participation certificate), payable at the election of ect in cash or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock at the then prevailing market price of the common stock. at any time when ect has the right to cause the issuer to purchase the income participation certificate, the issuer has the option to purchase the income participation certificate from ect for a purchase price of $15,000,000, payable in cash or common stock. in addition, under a deferred payment purchase agreement between ect and the issuer, the issuer may be obligated to issue common stock to ect to purchase principal payments under the loan agreement that canfibre of riverside does not pay when scheduled, if such payments are not brought current within one year, the purchase price for such payments to be made, at the election of ect, in cash or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock at 75% of the then prevailing market price of such common stock. the number of shares of common stock, if any, issuable to ect pursuant to the income participation agreement and the deferred purchase agreement cannot currently be determined. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1 -

(vi) no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made in an amount less than $.01 per share, but any such lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time together with the next subsequent 7 adjustment which, together with any adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to $.01 per share or more.

herein, all dividends on preference shares shall be paid by the company through the issuance of common stock. the number of shares of common stock issued in respect of accrued dividends with respect to any dividend period shall be determined by dividing (i) the dollar sum of the total dividends payable by (ii) 75% of the average price of the common stock during the 30-day period preceding the end of such dividend period. notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder of preference shares may elect to receive any dividend payment with respect to any semiannual dividend period in cash instead of

may be given by one or more instruments signed by the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding preference shares or by a resolution passed by at least a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the preference shareholders duly called for that purpose and held upon at least 10 days notice, at which the holders of a majority of the outstanding preference shares are present or

shares (except to the extent and out of net 10 cash proceeds received by the company from a substantially concurrent issue of junior shares) unless, in each case, all dividends then payable on the preference shares then outstanding accrued up to and including the dividends payable on the immediately preceding respective date or dates for the payment of dividend thereon shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. no dividend may be declared on nor may any redemption, repurchase or other retirement for value be made in respect of any series or class of capital stock ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to dividends, unless there also shall have been paid on the preference shares like dividends in respect of all periods at the dividend rate fixed therefor. if any cumulative dividends or amounts payable on a return of capital in respect of a series of preferred shares are not paid in full, the preferred shares of all series shall participate rateably in respect of such dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums that would be payable on such shares if all such dividends were declared and paid in full, and in respect of any repayment of capital in accordance with the sums that would be payable on such repayment of capital if all sums so payable were paid in full; provided however, that in the event of there being insufficient assets to satisfy in full all such claims to dividends and return of capital, the claims of the holders of the preferred shares of all series with respect to repayment of capital shall first be paid and satisfied and any assets remaining thereafter shall be applied towards the payment and satisfaction of claims in respect of dividends. 7.0 liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. in the event of any liquidation distribution, each preference shareholder shall be entitled to receive before any amount shall be paid by the company or any assets of the company shall be distributed to

such holder, together with an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid cumulative dividends thereon. after payment to the preference shareholders of the amount so payable to them, they shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of assets of the company. if upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company, the assets distributable among the holders of the preference shares (and any other 11 capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to the holder of all preference shares (and any other capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) of all preferential amounts payable to all such holders, then the entire assets of the company thus distributable shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the preference shares (any other capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) in proportion to the respective amounts that would be payable per share if such assets were sufficient too permit payment in full. 8.0 amendments to preference share provisions.

(iii) if the company at any time while any of the preference shares is outstanding shall pay to any holders of stock of the company a dividend payable in, or make any other distribution of, common stock, the conversion price shall be adjusted, as of the date the company shall take a record of the holders of such stock for the purpose of determining the holders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution (or if no such record is taken, as at the date of such payment or other distribution), to that price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such record date (or if no such record is taken, then immediately prior to such payment or other distribution) by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution. 6 (iv) if the company shall issue to all holders of its common stock any warrant, option or other right to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the average price of the common stock, the conversion price shall be adjusted, as of the date the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of receiving such issuance or distribution, to that price determined by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such warrants, options or rights plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such average price per share, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such warrants, options or rights plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase. (v) if the company shall distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of indebtedness of the company, shares of capital stock of the company (other than common stock) or assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those dividends, warrants, options and rights referred to in subparagraph (iv)) then in each case the conversion price shall be adjusted, as of the date the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of determining the holders entitled to receive such issuance or distribution, to that price determined by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be average price per share of the common stock less the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the assets, evidences of indebtedness for subscription rights so distributed in respect of one share of common stock and the denominator of which is the average price per share of common stock on the record date for such distribution. (vi) no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made in an amount less than $.01 per share, but any such lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time together with the next subsequent 7 adjustment which, together with any adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to $.01 per share or more. (h) whenever the conversion price and the conversion rate are required to be adjusted as provided herein, the company shall forthwith compute the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted conversion rate and shall prepare a certificate setting forth such adjusted conversion price and adjusted conversion rate showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. a copy of such certificate shall forthwith be filed with the transfer agent or agents for the preference shares (if any) and for the common stock; and thereafter, until further adjusted, the adjusted conversion price and the adjusted conversion rate shall be as set forth in such certificate, provided that the computation of such adjusted conversion price and such adjusted conversion rate shall be reviewed at least annually by the independent public accountants regularly employed by the company and said accountants shall file a corrected certificate, if required, with such transfer agent or agents. the company shall mail or cause to be mailed to the holders of preference shares at the time of each quarterly dividend payment, a statement setting forth the adjustments, if any, made in the applicable conversion price and conversion rate and not theretofore reported to such holders, and the reasons for such adjustment.

herein, all dividends on preference shares shall be paid by the company through the issuance of common stock. the number of shares of common stock issued in respect of accrued dividends with respect to any dividend period shall be determined by dividing (i) the dollar sum of the total dividends payable by (ii) 75% of the average price of the common stock during the 30-day period preceding the end of such dividend period. notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder of preference shares may elect to receive any dividend payment with respect to any semiannual dividend period in cash instead of through the receipt of common stock, by notifying the company of such election on or prior to the accrual date occurring immediately prior to the first day of such period. no fractional shares of

may be given by one or more instruments signed by the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding preference shares or by a resolution passed by at least a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the preference shareholders duly called for that purpose and held upon at least 10 days notice, at which the holders of a majority of the outstanding preference shares are present or

shares (except to the extent and out of net 10 cash proceeds received by the company from a substantially concurrent issue of junior shares) unless, in each case, all dividends then payable on the preference shares then outstanding accrued up to and including the dividends payable on the immediately preceding respective date or dates for the payment of dividend thereon shall have been declared

a parity with the preference shares as to dividends, unless there also shall have been paid on the preference shares like dividends in respect of all periods at the dividend rate fixed therefor. if any cumulative dividends or amounts payable on a return of capital in respect of a series of preferred shares are not paid in full, the preferred shares of all series shall participate rateably in respect of such dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums that would be payable on such shares if all such dividends were declared and paid in full, and in respect of any repayment of capital in accordance with the sums that would be payable on such repayment of capital if all sums so payable were paid in full; provided however, that in the event of there being insufficient assets to satisfy in full all such claims to dividends and return of capital, the claims of the holders of the preferred shares of all series with respect to repayment of capital shall first be paid and satisfied and any assets remaining thereafter shall be applied towards the payment and satisfaction of claims in respect of dividends. 7.0 liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. in the event of any liquidation distribution, each preference shareholder shall be entitled to receive before any amount shall be paid by the company or any assets of the company shall be distributed to

such holder, together with an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid cumulative dividends thereon. after payment to the preference shareholders of the amount so payable to them, they shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of assets of the company. if upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company, the assets distributable among the holders of the preference shares (and any other 11 capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full to the holder of all preference shares (and any other capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) of all preferential amounts payable to all such holders, then the entire assets of the company thus distributable shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the preference shares (any other capital stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preference shares as to assets) in proportion to the respective amounts that would be payable per share if such assets were sufficient too permit payment in full. 8.0 amendments to preference share provisions.

(the "investor"). introduction reference is made to the articles of amendment of the kafus capital corporation, a british columbia corporation ("kafus"), filed on july 15, 1997 (the "preference shares designation"), amending the articles of incorporation of kafus to designate the series i 10% convertible redeemable preference shares ("preference shares") of kafus and to the related subscription agreement dated as of july 16, 1997 (the "subscription agreement"), between kafus and the investor under which the investor is purchasing certain of the preference shares from kafus, the defined terms of which are used herein unless otherwise defined herein. the guarantor owns substantial interests in kafus and believes that the purchase of such preference shares will provide substantial direct and indirect benefit to the guarantor. therefore, to induce the investor to enter into the subscription agreement and to purchase such preference shares and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency which are hereby acknowledged, the guarantor hereby agrees as follows: section 1. guaranty. 1.1 the guarantor irrevocably guarantees to the investor the full payment when due of all present and future obligations of kafus to the investor under section 3.0 of the preference shares designation (redemption), whether or not kafus has obtained relief from such obligations under bankruptcy or other laws providing for relief from creditors, and (b) any increases, extensions, and rearrangements of the foregoing obligations under any amendments, supplements, and other modifications of the preference shares designation (collectively, the "guaranteed obligations"). this is a guaranty of payment and not merely a guaranty of collection, and the guarantor is liable as a primary obligor. if any of the guaranteed obligations are not punctually paid when due, the guarantor shall immediately pay the same to the investor. the guarantor shall make each payment owed to the investor under this agreement to the investor in u.s. dollars in immediately available funds as directed by the investor. the investor is hereby authorized at any time following any demand for payment hereunder to set off and apply any indebtedness owed by the investor to the guarantor against any and all of the obligations of the guarantor under this agreement. the investor agrees to promptly notify the guarantor after any such setoff and application, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 1.2 notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action by the investor to enforce performance by the guarantor under this agreement, the investor shall not have any right to seek recourse against or otherwise enforce any judgment against, or against the rights of the guarantor in, the swaisland family trust (as described in the letter dated july 15, 1997, by kpmg to the guarantor and provided to the investor) and in the shares of samarac trading and development corporation and samarac development corporation owned by such trust. nothing in this section 1.2 shall be deemed to limit the rights of the investor against the guarantor or any other assets of the guarantor. section 2. guaranty absolute. 2.1 this agreement shall be deemed accepted by the investor upon receipt, and the guarantor's obligations under this agreement are effective immediately and are continuing and cover all guaranteed obligations arising prior to and after the date hereof. this agreement may not be revoked by the guarantor and shall continue to be effective with respect to guaranteed obligations arising or created after any attempted revocation by the guarantor. 2.2 the guarantor guarantees that the guaranteed obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the preference shares designation, regardless of any law, regulation, or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the investor with respect thereto. the guarantor agrees that the guarantor's obligations under this agreement shall not be released, diminished, or impaired by, and waives any rights which the guarantor might otherwise have which relate to: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the guaranteed obligations, the preference shares designation, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any increase, reduction, extension, or rearrangement of the guaranteed obligations, any amendment, supplement, or other modification of the preference shares designation, any waiver or consent granted under the preference shares designation, including waivers of the payment of the guaranteed obligations, or any sale, assignment, delegation, or other transfer of the guaranteed obligations or the preference shares designation or the securities sold thereunder; (c) any grant of any security or support for the guaranteed obligations, including any pledge of collateral for the guaranteed obligations or any person guaranteeing or otherwise becoming liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations; 2 (d) any impairment of any security or support for the guaranteed obligations, including any full or partial release, exchange, subordination, or waste of any collateral for the guaranteed obligations or any full or partial release of kafus, any guarantor, or any other person liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations; (e) any change in the organization or structure of kafus, any guarantor, or any other person liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations; or the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of kafus or any other person liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations; (f) the failure to apply or any manner of applying payments or the proceeds of any security or support for the guaranteed obligations against the guaranteed obligations; (g) the failure to give notice of the occurrence of any of the events or actions referred to in this section 2.2 or notice of any default or event of default, however denominated, under the preference shares designation, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment, notice of protest, notice of grace, notice of dishonor, notice of bringing of action to enforce the payment of the guaranteed obligations, notice of any sale or foreclosure of any collateral for the guaranteed obligations, notice of any transfer of the guaranteed obligations, notice of the transfer of this agreement, notice of the financial condition of or other circumstances regarding kafus, any guarantor, or any other person liable for the guaranteed obligations, or any other notice of any kind relating to the guaranteed obligations; or (h) any other action taken or omitted which affects the guaranteed obligations, whether or not such action or omission prejudices the guarantor or increases the likelihood that the guarantor will be required to pay the guaranteed obligations pursuant to the terms hereof--it is the unambiguous and unequivocal intention of the guarantor that the guarantor shall be obligated to pay the guaranteed obligations when due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, event, action, or omission whatsoever, whether contemplated or uncontemplated, and whether or not particularly described herein. 2.3 this agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if any payment on the guaranteed obligations must be refunded for any reason including any bankruptcy proceeding. in the event that the investor must refund any payment received against the guaranteed obligations, any prior release from the terms of this agreement given to the guarantor by the investor shall be without effect, and this agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect. it is the intention of the guarantor that the guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be discharged except by final payment of the guaranteed obligations. section 3. unimpaired collection. 3 3.1 there are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this agreement, except as expressly contained herein. it shall not be necessary for the investor, in order to enforce payment by the guarantor under this agreement, to show any proof of kafus's default, to exhaust the investor's remedies against kafus, any guarantor, or any other person liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations, to enforce any security or support for the payment of the guaranteed obligations, or to enforce any other means of obtaining payment of the guaranteed obligations. the guarantor waives any rights under the laws of canada or any province thereof regarding suretyship or other similar statutory rights related to the foregoing. the investor shall not be required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect, or enforce the guaranteed obligations. 3.2 the guarantor hereby agrees that all subordinated obligations of the guarantor (as defined below) shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment and collection to the payment and collection in full of all guaranteed obligations as described below: (a) as used herein, the term "subordinated obligations" for the guarantor means: (i) all present and future indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of any kind owed by kafus or any of its subsidiaries to the guarantor, including debt obligations, equity obligations, and other contractual obligations requiring payments of any kind to be made to the guarantor and including any right of subrogation (including any statutory rights of subrogation under section 509 of the bankruptcy code, 11 u.s.c. (s) 509, or under any applicable provisions of bankruptcy or insolvency laws in canada or any province thereof), contribution, indemnification, reimbursement, exoneration, or any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the investor against kafus, any guarantor, or any person liable for the payment of the guaranteed obligations, or any collateral which the investor now has or may acquire, and (ii) any increases, extensions, and rearrangements of the foregoing obligations under any amendments, supplements, and other modifications of the documents and agreements creating the foregoing obligations. (b) until all guaranteed obligations have been irrevocably paid in full (and therefore the payment thereof is no longer subject to being set aside or returned under the law), the guarantor shall not take any action to enforce payment of the subordinated obligations of the guarantor, but the standstill set forth in this paragraph (b) is not intended as a permanent waiver of any subordinated obligations nor shall it limit the right of the guarantor to accept and receive payments not otherwise restricted hereunder (and therefore subject to the limitations in paragraphs (c) and (d) below). (c) upon any receivership, insolvency proceeding, bankruptcy proceeding, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement with creditors, sale of assets for creditors, dissolution, liquidation, or marshaling of assets of kafus, all amounts due with respect to the guaranteed obligations shall be irrevocably paid in full before the guarantor shall be entitled to collect or receive any payment with respect to the subordinated obligations of the guarantor, and all payments to which the guarantor would be entitled to collect or receive on the 4 subordinated obligations of the guarantor shall be paid over to the investor for application to the guaranteed obligations until irrevocably paid in full. (d) following notice from the investor to kafus that a default under the preference shares designation has occurred and is continuing and that no further payments shall be made on the subordinated obligations of the guarantor, all amounts due with respect to the guaranteed obligations shall be paid in full before the guarantor shall be entitled to collect or receive any payment with respect to the subordinated obligations of the guarantor. (e) any lien, security interest, or assignment securing the repayment of the subordinated obligations of the guarantor shall be fully subordinate to any lien, security interest, or assignment in favor of the investor which secures the guaranteed obligations. at the request of the investor, the guarantor will take any and all steps necessary to fully evidence the subordination granted hereunder, including amending or terminating financing statements and executing and recording subordinations of liens. (f) this is an absolute and irrevocable agreement of subordination and the investor may, without notice to the guarantor, take any action described in section 2.2 without impairing or releasing the obligations of the guarantor hereunder. (g) the guarantor shall not assign or otherwise transfer to any person any interest in the subordinated obligations of the guarantor without prior written notice to the investor and obtaining the written assumption by the transferee of the subordination provisions of this section 3.2 with respect to the subordinated obligations that are the subject of the transfer. (h) if any amount shall be paid to the guarantor in violation of this section 3.2, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the investor and immediately turned over to the investor, with any necessary endorsement, to be applied to the guaranteed obligations. section 4. miscellaneous. 4.1 in connection with maintaining sufficient assets to fulfil the obligations of the guarantor under this agreement, the guarantor agrees as follows: (a) the guarantor shall maintain ownership of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of the samarac corporation ltd.; (b) the guarantor

shall not transfer any assets owned by the guarantor to the swaisland family trust or to samarac trading and development corporation or samarac development corporation. 4.2 if the guarantor shall breach any of the terms of this agreement, including section 4.1 hereof, the guarantor shall at the request of the investor deposit cash collateral for the contingent obligations of the guarantor under this agreement in the amount of 100% of the maximum contingent liability of the guarantor hereunder in a cash collateral account controlled by the investor that is pledged to the investor to secure the obligations of the guarantor under this agreement. in connection therewith, the guarantor shall execute any documents and agreements reasonably requested by the investor to accomplish the foregoing. 4.3 the guarantor shall pay to the investor on demand all out-of- pocket costs and expenses of the investor in connection with the preservation or enforcement of the investor's rights under this agreement, whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the investor. the provisions of this paragraph shall survive any purported termination of this agreement that does not expressly reference this paragraph. 4.4 the guarantor agrees to protect, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the investor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, and attorneys (collectively, the "indemnified parties"), from and against all demands, claims, actions, suits, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, liabilities, and costs and expenses, including reasonable out-of- pocket costs of attorneys and related costs of experts such as accountants (collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"), actually

indemnified liabilities caused by any indemnified parties' own negligence, but not indemnified liabilities which are a result of any indemnified parties' gross negligence or willful misconduct or

shall be governed by the internal laws of british columbia, canada (without reference to principles of conflicts of laws). if any provision in this agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. all representations, warranties, and covenants of the guarantor in this agreement shall survive the

purchase agreement this income participation certificate purchase agreement dated as of june 1, 1997 ("agreement"), is made by the kafus capital corporation ("kafus") in favor of enron capital & trade resources corp. ("lender"). introduction this agreement is made by kafus in connection with the subordinated loan agreement dated as of june 1, 1997 (as modified from time to time, the "subordinated loan agreement"), between canfibre of riverside, inc. ("borrower"), and the lender, and the related income participation certificate dated as of june 1, 1997 (as modified from time to time, the "income participation certificate"), made by the borrower in favor of the lender. the effectiveness of this agreement is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the subordinated loan agreement and the extension of credit to the borrower provided thereunder. as the borrower is a subsidiary of kafus, kafus believes that it will receive substantial benefit from such credit extended to the borrower by the lender. therefore, to induce the lender to enter into the subordinated loan agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, kafus and the lender hereby agree as follows: section 1. definitions. capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in appendix a to the trust indenture dated as of june 1, 1997 (as modified from time to time, the "indenture") made by the california pollution control finance authority in favor of bny western trust company under which certain bonds are being issued for the benefit of the borrower (but without amendment thereto after the date of this agreement unless approved by the lender in writing). as used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings: "purchase activation date" means the earlier of the date one calendar year after the completion date or the date of the occurrence of any event of default under and as defined in the subordinated loan agreement. "received income discount" means, as of any date of determination, an amount equal to the net present value as of the date of this agreement of any cash payments received by the lender under the income participation certificate as of the date of determination discounted back to the date of this agreement using standard financial techniques selected by the lender and a discount rate of 12.00% per annum (but when applied as of the date of determination, such amount shall not be adjusted to bring such net present value as of the date of this agreement forward to the date of determination). section 2. purchase agreement; guaranty. 2.1 upon demand by the lender at any time after the purchase activation date, kafus shall purchase the income participation certificate from the lender at a price equal to u.s. $12,500,000 less the received income discount. any written certificate provided by the lender to kafus showing the calculation of the purchase price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. kafus shall make payment to the lender within five business days after presentation to kafus of the income participation certificate accompanied with such transfer endorsements or instruments as are necessary to transfer the same to kafus. 2.2 kafus irrevocably guarantees to the lender that the lender shall have received from the borrower under the income participation certificate at any date after the purchase activation date an amount equal to the sum of the purchase price that would be owed under section 2.1 at such time plus any amounts actually received by the lender under the income participation certificate (the"guaranteed amount"), and shall pay to the lender upon demand the difference between the amounts actually received by the lender under the income participation certificate and the guaranteed amount. any written certificate provided by the lender to kafus showing the calculation of the amount due under this guaranty shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. this is a guaranty of payment and not merely a guaranty of collection, and kafus is liable as a primary obligor. prior to making any claim under the guaranty provided in this section 2.2, kafus must have failed to purchase upon demand under section 2.1. section 3. purchase option in favor of kafus. the lender hereby grants kafus with the right to purchase the income participation certificate from the lender at any time after the purchase activation date at a price equal to u.s. $15,000,000 less the received income discount. any written certificate provided by the lender to kafus showing the calculation of the purchase price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. if kafus elects to purchase the income participation certificate at such price, kafus shall make payment to the lender upon presentation to kafus of the income participation certificate accompanied with such transfer endorsements or instruments as are necessary to transfer the same to kafus. section 4. method of payment. kafus shall make each payment to the lender at the option of the lender (a) in wire transfer of u.s. dollars in immediately available funds to the lender at such payment location as directed by the lender, (b) in shares of the common stock of kafus issued to the lender and applied to the obligations of kafus hereunder with the value of the shares to be used in such application determined based upon the price (as defined below) applicable at the time of payment, or (c) in any combination of the methods expressed in clauses (a) and (b) above as determined by the lender. as used herein, the "price" with respect to the common stock of kafus means, on any day, (i) the preceding 20-day average of the reported "high" and "low" sales prices for such shares (w) on the american stock exchange or (x) if such shares are not so listed, then on the largest national securities exchange (based on the aggregate dollar value of securities listed) on which such shares are listed or traded or (y) if such shares are not listed on any national securities exchange, then through the nasdaq national market or, (z) if such shares shall not be so listed, the trade 2 weighted average of all transactions in the common stock in an over-the-counter market;

(c) any change in the organization or structure of the borrower, kafus, or any other person liable for the payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate, or the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of the borrower, kafus, or any other 3 person liable for the payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate; (d) the manner of applying payments on the amounts due under the income participation certificate or the proceeds of any security or support for the amounts due under the income participation certificate against the amounts due under the income participation certificate; (e) the failure to give notice of the occurrence of any default or event of default, however denominated, under the income participation certificate, notice of bringing of action to enforce the payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate, notice of any sale or foreclosure of any collateral for the amounts due under the income participation certificate, notice of the financial condition of or other circumstances regarding the borrower, kafus, or any other person liable for the amounts due under the income participation certificate, or any other notice of any kind relating to the amounts due under the income participation certificate; or (f) any other action taken or omitted which affects the amounts due under the income participation certificate, whether or not such action or omission prejudices kafus or increases the likelihood that kafus will be required to pay the amounts due under the income participation certificate pursuant to the terms hereof--it is the unambiguous and unequivocal intention of kafus that kafus shall be obligated to pay the amounts due under the income participation certificate in accordance with its terms when due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, event, action, or omission whatsoever, whether contemplated or uncontemplated, and whether or not particularly described herein. 5.2 this agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if any payment on the amounts due under the income participation certificate must be refunded for any reason including any bankruptcy proceeding. in the event that the lender must refund any payment received against the amounts due under the income participation certificate, any prior release from the terms of this agreement given to kafus by the lender shall be without effect, and this agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect. it is the intention of kafus that kafus's obligations hereunder shall not be discharged except by final payment of the amounts due under the income participation certificate. section 6. unimpaired collection. 6.1 there are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this agreement, except as expressly contained herein. it shall not be necessary for the lender, in order to enforce payment by kafus under this agreement, to show any proof of the borrower's default, to exhaust the lender's remedies against the borrower or any other person liable for the payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate, to enforce any security or support for the payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate, or to 4 enforce any other means of obtaining payment or performance of the amounts due under the income participation certificate. the lender shall not be required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect, or enforce the amounts due under the income participation certificate. section 7. miscellaneous. 7.1 kafus shall pay to the lender on demand all costs and expenses of the lender in connection with the preservation or enforcement of the lender's rights under this agreement, whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise, including fees and expenses of counsel for the lender. the provisions of this paragraph shall survive any purported termination of this agreement that does not expressly reference this paragraph. 7.2 (a) kafus shall at all times protect and hold the lender and its respective shareholders, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and servants and the persons under their respective control or supervision (collectively, the "indemnified parties") harmless of, from, and against any and all claims (whether in tort, contract, or otherwise), demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (each referred to herein as a "loss") which an indemnified party may incur or which may be claimed against an indemnified party by any person, in each case by reason of, or arising out of this agreement and the income participation certificate or any other document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith or the enforcement of any of the terms or provisions hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that the indemnity set forth in this section shall not extend to any loss arising, in the case of any indemnified party, as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnified party. kafus further covenants and agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to pay or to reimburse the indemnified parties for any and all costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities, or expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against, or otherwise in connection with any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses, or actions, except to the extent that the same arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party claiming such payment or reimbursement. (b) an indemnified party shall promptly notify kafus in writing of any claim or action brought against such indemnified party in which indemnity may be sought against kafus pursuant to this section; and such notice shall be given in sufficient time to allow kafus to defend such claim or action. however, the failure to give such notice in sufficient time shall not constitute a defense hereunder nor in any way impair the obligations of kafus under this section, if (i) the indemnified party shall not have had knowledge or notice of such claim or action, (ii) neither kafus nor any affiliate thereof shall have had knowledge or notice of such claim or action, or (iii) kafus's ability to defend such claim or action shall not thereby be materially impaired. in the event, however, that (i) the indemnified party shall not have timely notified kafus of any such claim or action, (ii) neither kafus nor any affiliate thereof shall have had knowledge or notice of such claim or action, and (iii) kafus's ability to defend or participate in such claim or action is materially impaired by reason of not having received timely notice thereof from the indemnified party, then kafus's 5 obligation to so defend and indemnify shall be qualified to the extent (and only to the extent) of such material impairment.

("borrower"), and the lender. the effectiveness of this agreement is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the subordinated loan agreement and the extension of credit to the borrower provided thereunder. as the borrower is a subsidiary of kafus, kafus believes that it will receive substantial benefit from such credit extended to the borrower by the lender. therefore, to induce the lender to enter into the subordinated loan agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, kafus and the lender hereby agree as follows: section 1. definitions. capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in appendix a to the trust indenture dated as of june 1, 1997 (as modified from time to time, the "indenture") made by the california pollution control finance authority in favor of bny western trust company under which certain bonds are being issued for the benefit of the borrower (but without amendment thereto after the date of this agreement unless approved by the lender in writing). as used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings: "eligible deferred payment" means any payment of principal on the subordinated loan under, and as defined in, the subordinated loan agreement for which the due date has been deferred pursuant to section 3.4(b) of the subordinated loan agreement, or for which the due date has been accelerated pursuant to section 7.2 of the subordinated loan agreement, if one year after the date of deferral or acceleration the borrower has not made payments of principal on the subordinated loan in an amount at least equal to the amount of the principal payment for which the due date was deferred or the amount of the principal payment which was accelerated. section 2. purchase agreement; guaranty. 2.1 upon demand by the lender, kafus shall (a) purchase any eligible deferred payment for a price equal to the principal amount of such eligible deferred payment, payable in u.s. dollars, and (b) forgive the payment of such eligible deferred payment in favor of the borrower. kafus shall make payment to the lender within five business days after presentation to kafus of an assignment and termination document in form sufficient to accomplishing the foregoing. 2.2 kafus irrevocably guarantees to the lender that the lender shall have received from the borrower the payment of each eligible deferred payment, and shall pay to the lender upon demand the amount of such eligible deferred payment. this is a guaranty of payment and not merely a guaranty of collection, and kafus is liable as a primary obligor. prior to making any claim under the guaranty provided in this section 2.2, kafus must have failed to purchase upon demand under section 2.1. section 3. method of payment. kafus shall make each payment to the lender in shares of the common stock of kafus issued to the lender and applied to the obligations of kafus hereunder with the value of the shares to be used in such application determined based upon the price (as defined below) applicable at the time of payment. as used herein, the "price" with respect to the common stock of kafus means, on any day, (i) 75% of the preceding 20-day average of the reported "high" and "low" sales prices for such shares as reported (w) on the american stock exchange or (x) if such shares are not so listed, then on the largest national securities exchange (based on the aggregate dollar value of securities listed) on which such shares are listed or traded or (y) if such shares are not listed on any national securities exchange, then through the nasdaq national market or, (z) if such shares shall not be so listed, the trade weighted average of all transactions in the common stock in an over-the-counter market;
