(a) if at any time or from time to time tylan general shall determine to register any of its securities, either for its own account or the account of a security holder or holders, in connection with a public offering of such securities solely for cash on a form that would also permit the registration of registrable securities, tylan general will: (i) promptly give to each holder written notice thereof; and (ii) include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the registrable securities specified in a written request or requests, made within 20 days after the written notice specified in clause (i) above has been given. provided, however, tylan general shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any registration pursuant to this section 8.6 (a) prior to the publication date or (b) if the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding give written notice to tylan prior to the effectiveness of such registration that all of the registrable securities are to be withdrawn from such registration. (b) if the registration of which tylan general gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, tylan general shall so advise the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 8.6(a)(i). in such event, the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this section 8.6 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with tylan general and the other holders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by tylan general. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 8.6, if the managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may limit the registrable securities to be included in such registration. if the managing underwriter so limits the number of registrable securities to be registered and underwritten, tylan general shall so advise all selling stockholders of tylan general, including the holders, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all stockholders of tylan general, including the holders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities held by such selling stockholders of tylan general, including the selling holders at the time of filing the registration statement; provided, however, that with respect to any registration resulting from any demand registration rights (the "prior demand rights") pursuant to the prior registration rights agreements, the registrable securities shall be included in such registration only if all of the securities requested to be registered pursuant to the prior demand rights have been included in such registration. to facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, tylan general may round the number of shares allocated to any holder or holder to the nearest multiple of 100 shares. if any selling holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, including any limitation on the number of registrable securities that such holder may include in such underwriting, such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to tylan general and the managing underwriter. any securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration and shall not be transferred in a public distribution prior to 120 days after the effective date of the registration statement relating thereto, or such shorter period of time as the underwriters may require. (c) tylan general shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this section 8.6 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any holder has elected to include securities in such registration. (d) from and after the date hereof, tylan general shall not enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of tylan general which would allow such holder or prospective holder to require tylan general to include shares or securities in any registration initiated by 30 32 the holders under section 8.5 of this agreement, without the written consent of a majority in interest of the holders requesting registration unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of its securities will not diminish the amount of registrable securities that are included. nothing in this section 8.6(d) shall limit the right of tylan general to enter into an agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of tylan general pursuant to which tylan general will agree to include among the securities which it is registering upon its own initiation securities owned by such holder. 8.7 expenses of registration. all registration expenses incurred in connection with any registration of registrable securities pursuant to sections 8.5 and 8.6 shall be borne by tylan general. all selling expenses relating to registrable securities registered on behalf of the holders shall be borne by the holders of such registrable securities pro rata on the basis of the number of shares so registered; provided that each holder is solely responsible for the fees and disbursements of its separate individual counsel, if any. 8.8 registration procedures. in the case of each registration, qualification or compliance effected by tylan general pursuant to this article 8, tylan general will keep each holder advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration, qualification and compliance and as to the completion thereof. at its expense, tylan general will: (i) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the lesser of (a) 180 days or (b) until the distribution described in the registration statement has been completed; and (ii) furnish to the holders participating in such registration and to the underwriters of the securities being registered such reasonable number of copies of the registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus and such other documents as such underwriters may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public offering of such securities. 8.9 indemnification. (a) tylan general will indemnify each holder, each of its officers and directors and partners, and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, with respect to which registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this article 8, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by tylan general of the securities act or the exchange act or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act or the exchange act applicable to tylan general in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and tylan general will reimburse each such holder, each of its officers and directors, and each person controlling such holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that tylan general will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to tylan general by such holder, controlling person or underwriter and specifically for use therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, as far as the foregoing indemnity relates to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in the preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement becomes effective or in the final prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to rule 424(b), the 31 33 indemnity agreement herein shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter or, if there is no underwriter, any holder if a copy of the final prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424(b) was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such furnishing is required by the securities act. (b) each holder will, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify tylan, each of its directors and officers, each underwriter, if any, of tylan general's securities covered by such registration, qualification or compliance, each person who controls tylan general or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, and each other such holder including registrable securities in such registration, each of its officers and directors and each person controlling such other holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse tylan general, such other holders, or such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to tylan general by such holder specifically for use therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each holder under this subsection (b) shall be limited in an amount equal to the initial public offering price of the shares sold by such holder, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful conduct by such holder. notwithstanding the foregoing, as far as the foregoing indemnity relates to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in the preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement becomes effective or in the final prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424(b), the indemnity agreement herein shall not inure to the benefit of tylan general, any underwriter or any other holder if a copy of the final prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424(b) was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such furnishing is required by the securities act, unless delivery of such final prospectus was the responsibility of the indemnifying party (as hereinafter defined) hereunder. (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 8.9 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense. the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this article 8 unless the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action. the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or separate and different defenses. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of each indemnifying party. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 8.9 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such 32 34 indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by tylan general, all shareholders offering securities in the offering (the "selling shareholders") and the underwriters of the offering (the "underwriters") from the offering of tylan general securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of tylan general, the selling shareholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by tylan general, the selling shareholders and the underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by tylan general and the selling shareholders, respectively, and the underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriters bear to the aggregate price of the offering to the public. the relative fault of tylan general, the selling shareholders and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by tylan general, the selling shareholders or the underwriters and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. it is agreed that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8.9(d) were based solely upon the number of entities from whom contribution was requested or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 8.9(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above in this section 8.9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such action or claim, subject to the provisions of section 8.9(c) hereof. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 8.9(d), no selling shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount or make any other payments under this agreement which in the aggregate exceed the proceeds received by such selling shareholder. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11 of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8.10 information by holder. each holder holding registrable securities included in any registration shall furnish to tylan general such information regarding such holder, the registrable securities held by such holder and the distribution proposed by such holder as tylan general may request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this article 8. 8.11 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may at any time permit the sale of the restricted securities to the public without registration, tylan general agrees to use its best efforts to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act; (ii) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of tylan general under the securities act and the exchange act; and (iii) so long as a holder owns any restricted securities, to furnish to such holder forthwith upon request a written statement by tylan general as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144 and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of tylan general, and such other reports and documents of tylan general as such holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing such holder to sell any such securities without registration. 8.12 transfer of registration rights. the rights to cause tylan general to register securities granted to a holder under this article 8 may be assigned to a transferee or assignee in connection with any transfer or assignment of registrable securities by such holder provided that such transfer may otherwise be effected in accordance with applicable securities laws. 33 35 8.13 termination of registration rights. the right of any holder to request registration or inclusion in any registration pursuant to section 8.5 or 8.6 shall terminate on the earlier of (a) such date as all shares of registrable securities held by such holder may immediately be sold under rule 144 during any 90-day period or (b) the third anniversary of the closing date. 8.14 volume limitation on sale of registrable securities included in any registration hereunder. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article 8, during any 90-day period no holder shall be entitled to sell registrable securities registered or included in any registration pursuant to section 8.5 or 8.6 in excess of the number of shares which, absent such registration, could be sold by such holder under rule 144(e), assuming for purposes of this calculation that such holder satisfies the holding period for restricted securities set forth in rule 144(d) and the other requirements of rule 144. 9. indemnity by shareholders 9.1 indemnity. in connection with the merger, each shareholder shall, on a pro rata basis based on the fully diluted span common shares outstanding, indemnify tylan general, tylan general sub and span against any loss, expense, liability, or other damages, including the reasonable costs of investigation, interest, penalties and attorney's and accountant's fees ("damages"), incurred in connection with or arising from or attributable to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by span or the shareholders herein or any breach or failure to perform any agreement or covenant of span or the shareholders herein. 9.2 threshold. the shareholders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to section 9.1 for any damages until such time as the total amount of all damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of tylan general, tylan general sub and span, or to which any one or more of tylan general, tylan general sub and span has or have otherwise become subject exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate. at such time as the total amount of such damages exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, tylan general, tylan general sub and span shall be entitled to be indemnified against the full amount of such damages (and not solely the amount that exceeds $100,000). 9.3 expiration of indemnity. tylan general, tylan general sub and span may make no claim for indemnification for damages after january 31, 1997 (the "claim deadline"). the expiration of the period within which claims may be made shall not affect any rights of tylan general, tylan general sub and span with respect to claims made prior to the claim deadline. 9.4 fraud. notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, the liability of a shareholder for fraud shall be subject only to applicable statutes of limitations, and any claim against any shareholder alleging fraud need not be presented by the claim deadline. 9.5 survival of representations and warranties. other than disclosures set forth in the schedules hereto or in the compliance certificate to be delivered at closing pursuant to section 6.2 hereof, no disclosure by span nor any investigation by or on behalf of tylan general or tylan general sub with respect to span shall be deemed to affect tylan general's or tylan general sub's reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or to waive span's, tylan general's or tylan general sub's rights to indemnity as provided herein for the breach or inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of span. the indemnity obligations of the shareholders under this article 9 (and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of span and the shareholders) shall survive the closing until the claim deadline. 9.6 merger consideration adjustments. any amount paid by the shareholders to tylan general, tylan general sub or span pursuant to this article 9 shall be an adjustment to the consideration paid to the shareholders in connection with the merger. 9.7 shareholders' agent. (a) each of the shareholders hereby constitutes and appoints don e. whitson (the "shareholders' agent") as his agent and attorney-in-fact to take such action on behalf of the shareholder, and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are authorized, delegated and granted to the shareholders' 34 36 agent under this agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, to give and receive notices and communications, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the shareholders' agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing, including without limitation the right to resolve any disagreement or disputes, and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental thereto. a decision, act, consent, instruction or determination of the shareholders' agent shall constitute a decision of all shareholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the shareholders. the shareholders' agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as shareholders' agent unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. the shareholders shall jointly and severally indemnify the shareholders' agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of such shareholders' agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder. no bond shall be required of the shareholders' agent, and the shareholders' agent shall receive no compensation for his services. (b) the provisions set forth in this section 9.7 shall have no effect on the obligations of either the shareholders' agent or the shareholders to tylan general, tylan general sub or span, and such provisions are solely for the purposes of determining the rights and obligations of the shareholders, on the one hand, and the shareholders' agent, on the other, vis-a-vis each other and shall in no way impose any obligations on tylan general, tylan general sub or span other than those explicitly set forth in this agreement. in particular, notwithstanding in any case any notice received by tylan general, tylan general sub or span to the contrary, tylan general, tylan general sub or span shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled (i) to rely upon actions, decisions, consents, instructions and determinations of the shareholders' agent in his capacity as the shareholders' agent, and (ii) to assume that all actions, decisions, consents, instructions and determinations of the shareholders' agent are fully authorized by the shareholders, and all such actions, decisions, consents, instructions and determinations shall be binding and conclusive upon each shareholder. (c) in the event that don e. whitson is unavailable to act as the shareholders' agent, or becomes incapable (through death or legal incapacity) of acting as the shareholders' agent, then leo e. whitson shall become the shareholders' agent, and, in connection therewith, is authorized to take such action on behalf of the shareholders and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are authorized, delegated and granted to such shareholders' agent under this agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental thereto. 10. indemnity by tylan general 10.1 indemnity. in connection with the merger, tylan general shall indemnify the shareholders against any damages incurred in connection with or arising from or attributable to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by tylan general or tylan general sub herein or any breach or failure to perform any agreement or covenant of tylan general or tylan general sub herein. 10.2 threshold. tylan general shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to section 10.1 for any damages until such time as the total amount of all damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the shareholders, or to which any one or more of the shareholders has or have otherwise become subject exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate. at such time as the total amount of such damages exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, the shareholders shall be entitled to be indemnified against the full amount of such damages (and not solely the amount that exceeds $100,000). 10.3 expiration of indemnity. the shareholders may make no claim for indemnification for damages after the claim deadline. the expiration of the period within which claims may be made shall affect any rights of the shareholders with respect to claims made prior to the claim deadline. 10.4 fraud. notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, the liability of tylan general for fraud shall be subject only to applicable statutes of limitations, and any claim against tylan general alleging fraud need not be presented by the claim deadline. 35 37 10.5 survival of representations and warranties. the indemnity obligations of tylan general under this article 10 (and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of tylan general and tylan general sub) shall survive the closing until the claim deadline. 11. employee matters 11.1 employees. each employee of span immediately before the closing (each, a "span employee") shall continue to be employed by span or tylan general after the effective date; provided that, except as provided in section 5.2(i) hereof or pursuant to existing employment agreements between ronald l. ewers and bradley l. busch and ocala, such employment shall be on an at-will basis, and nothing herein shall obligate span or tylan general to continue to employ any span employee for any period of time; and provided further that with respect solely to the employee benefit plans and arrangements of tylan general, the term of each span employee's employment at span will be added to his or her term of employment at tylan general or the surviving corporation. 12. termination of agreement 12.1 termination. at any time prior to the closing date, this agreement may be terminated: (a) by mutual consent of all the parties; (b) by tylan general if a majority of the members of the board of directors of tylan general does not approve the results of tylan general's pre-acquisition investigation and review as required in section 6.1;

gardere & wynne, counsel to span 1. each of span and ocala has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of texas. each of span and ocala has the requisite corporate power to own its property and assets and to conduct its business as it is currently being conducted and to the best of counsel's knowledge is qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in the united states in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and where any statutory fines or penalties or any corporate disability imposed for the failure to qualify would materially and adversely affect tylan, its assets, financial condition or operations. to the best of counsel's knowledge, except for ocala, span has no subsidiaries. 2. all corporate action on the part of span, its board of directors and its shareholders necessary for the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of the reorganization agreement has been taken. the reorganization agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by span and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of span enforceable against span in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 3. the reorganization agreement, the shareholder agreements and the affiliate agreements (collectively, the "agreements") have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the shareholders and constitute valid and binding agreements of the shareholders enforceable against each of them in accordance with their terms, except as indemnity obligations under sections 8.1 of the reorganization agreement may be limited by applicable laws and except as enforcement of each of the agreements may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 4. the authorized capital stock of span consists of 500,000 shares of common stock, no par value, of which 265,699 shares are issued and outstanding. the authorized capital stock of ocala consists of 1,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 100,000 shares are issued and outstanding, of which 75,000 shares are owned by span. all of the issued and outstanding shares of span and ocala (i) have been duly authorized and validly issued, (ii) are fully paid and non-assessable and (iii) have been issued in full compliance with all applicable securities laws. to the best of counsel's knowledge, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, stock appreciation rights, calls, rights, convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of any character relating to issued or unissued capital shares or other securities of span or ocala, or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for, any capital shares of span or ocala. to the best of counsel's knowledge, none of the outstanding shares of span or ocala's capital stock are subject to any preemptive right other than the preemptive rights provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, co-sale right, right of first refusal or other similar right (other than with respect to the shares of ocala owned by span, as provided in section 5.1 of the shareholders agreement dated ). 5. the execution, delivery and performance by span of the reorganization agreement and the consummation by span of the transactions contemplated therein will not violate any provision of span's or ocala's charter or bylaws, and will not constitute a material default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or other evidence of indebtedness of span or ocala or any material license agreement, lease or other material contract, instrument or obligation to which span or ocala is a party or by which span or ocala or any of either of their assets may be bound, and will not violate or contravene (i) any governmental statute, rule or regulation applicable to span or ocala or (ii) any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award which has been entered against span or ocala and of which we are aware, the violation or contravention 6-1 61 of which would materially and adversely affect span or ocala, or either of their assets, financial condition or otherwise. 6. to the best of counsel's knowledge, there is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or overtly threatened in writing against span or the shareholders before any court or administrative agency that questions the validity of the agreements or might result in any material adverse change in the assets, financial conditions or operations of span. 7. all consents, approvals, authorizations, or orders of, and filings, registrations, and qualifications with any regulatory authority or governmental body in the united states required for the consummation by span and the shareholders of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement have been made or obtained. 8. in the course of the preparation of the registration statement and the prospectus/joint proxy statement, we have participated in discussions and conferences with officers of tylan and span and with representatives of their respective independent public accountants during which successive drafts of the registration statement and the prospectus/joint proxy statement were reviewed and we have also reviewed and discussed with various of such persons materials submitted for use in the registration statement, the prospectus/joint proxy statement and certain other data and information furnished in support of the statements made therein. while we have not independently verified, are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the registration statement or the prospectus/joint proxy statement, we advise you that, with regard to span, nothing has come to our attention which caused us to believe that the registration statement as of its effective date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the prospectus/joint proxy statement, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except, in each case, for the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom, as to which we express no view). 6-2 62 exhibit 6.14 non-competition agreement this non-competition

developed considerable expertise in the business operations of span and has had access to trade secrets and confidential business methods, plans and practices considered confidential by span and not generally known in its industry. shareholder recognizes that this information will have commercial value in the business in which tylan general is engaged and therefore that tylan general would be irreparably damaged if shareholder were to enter into an activity competing or interfering with span's business in violation of the terms of this agreement or if shareholder were to disclose or make unauthorized use of any confidential information concerning the business of span. accordingly, shareholder expressly acknowledges that he is voluntarily entering into this agreement and that the terms

way; or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customers, suppliers, distributors, resellers, or independent contractors of span to terminate their relationships with span. 5. independence of obligations. the covenants of shareholder set forth in this agreement shall be construed as independent of any other agreement or arrangement between shareholder, on the one hand, and span or tylan general or any of their subsidiaries, on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by shareholder against span or tylan general or any of their subsidiaries shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against shareholder. 6. severability. if any provision of this agreement or the application of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held

instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below. where we render an opinion "to the best of our knowledge" or concerning and item "known

particular jurisdiction apply, and no opinion to the extent that the laws of any jurisdiction other than those identified above are applicable to the subject matter hereof. we are not rendering any opinion as to compliance with any antitrust laws or antifraud law, rule or regulation relating to securities, or to the sale or issuance thereof. 8-1 66 with regard to our opinion in paragraph 4 below, we have examined and relied upon (i) a certificate executed by an officer of the company, to the effect that the consideration for all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company was received by the company in accordance with the provisions of the applicable board of director resolutions and any plan or agreement relating to the issuance of such shares, and (ii) a certificate executed by tylan's transfer agent, the first national bank of boston, as to the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of , 1996; and we have undertaken no independent verification with respect thereto. with regard to our opinion in paragraph 6 below with respect to any material default under the provisions of any material contract, we have relied solely upon an examination of the agreements and instruments filed as exhibits to the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended october 29, 1995 (collectively, the "material contracts"); we have made no further investigation. on the basis of the foregoing, in reliance thereon and with the foregoing qualifications, we are of the opinion that: 1. each of tylan and tylan sub has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware. each of tylan and tylan sub has the requisite corporate power to own its property and assets and to conduct its business as it is currently being conducted and, to the best of our knowledge, is qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in the united states in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and where any statutory fines or penalties or any corporate disability imposed for the failure to qualify would materially and adversely affect tylan, its assets, financial condition or operations. 2. the agreements have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by tylan and constitute valid and binding agreements of tylan enforceable against tylan in accordance with their respective terms, except as indemnity obligations under section 9.1 of the reorganization agreement may be limited by applicable laws and except as enforcement of the agreements may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 3. the reorganization agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by tylan sub and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of tylan sub enforceable against tylan sub in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 4. tylan's authorized capital stock consists of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which there are issued and outstanding, and 50,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value, of which there are outstanding shares. the outstanding shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and no preemptive rights or rights of refusal in favor of stockholders exist with respect to the common stock of tylan, or the issue and sale thereof, under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of tylan. 5. the shares of tylan common stock issuable to shareholders in the merger (the "shares") have been duly authorized, and upon issuance and delivery upon consummation of the merger in accordance with the terms of the reorganization agreement, the shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 6. the execution and delivery by tylan and tylan sub of the reorganization agreement and the issuance of the shares pursuant thereto will not violate any provision of tylan's or tylan sub's charter or bylaws, and will not constitute a material default under the provisions of any material contract, and will not violate or contravene (a) any governmental statute, rule or regulation applicable to tylan or tylan sub or (b) any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award which has been entered 8-2 67 against tylan or tylan sub and of which we are aware, the violation or contravention of which would materially and adversely affect tylan, its assets, financial condition or operations. 7. to the best of our knowledge, there is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or overtly threatened against tylan or tylan sub before any court or administrative agency that questions the validity of the reorganization agreement or might result in any material adverse change in the assets, financial conditions or operations of tylan. 8. all consents, approvals, authorizations or orders of, and filings, registrations and qualifications with any regulatory authority or governmental body in the united states required for the consummation by tylan and tylan sub of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement have been made or obtained, except for any blue sky filings required by applicable state securities laws. 9. the registration statement became effective under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), by order of the securities and exchange commission on , 1996, and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the act. 10. the registration statement and the prospectus/joint proxy statement and any supplements or amendments thereto (except for the financial statements, the schedules thereto and other financial and statistical information included therein as to which we express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the securities act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. *** in the course of the preparation of the registration statement and the prospectus/joint proxy statement, we have participated in discussions and conferences with officers of tylan and span and with representatives of their respective independent public accountants during which successive drafts of the registration statement and the prospectus/joint proxy statement were reviewed and we have also reviewed and discussed with various of such persons materials submitted for use in the registration statement, the prospectus/joint proxy statement and certain other data and information furnished in support of the statements made therein. while we have not independently verified, are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the registration statement or the prospectus/joint proxy statement, we advise you that, with regard to tylan, nothing has come to our attention which caused us to believe (i) that the registration statement as of its effective date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the prospectus/joint proxy statement, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except, in each case, for the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom, as to which we express no view), or (ii) that any of the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus/joint proxy statement, when such documents were filed with the securities and exchange commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except, in each case, for the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom, as to which we express no view). 8-3 68 this opinion is intended solely for your benefit and is not to be made available to or be relied upon by any other person, firm or entity without our prior written consent. sincerely, cooley godward castro huddleson & tatum
