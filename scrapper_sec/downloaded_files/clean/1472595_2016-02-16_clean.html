(a) conversion at the option of the holders . each share of series a preferred stock may be converted on any date, from time to time, at the option of the holder thereof, into the number of shares of common stock (the &ldquo;per share amount&rdquo;) equal to the conversion price multiplied by the conversion rate in effect at such time. the right of conversion attaching to any shares of series a preferred stock may be exercised by the holders thereof by delivering the shares to be converted to the office of the company, accompanied by a duly signed and completed notice of conversion in form reasonably satisfactory to the company. the conversion date shall be the date on which the shares of series a preferred stock and the duly signed and completed notice of conversion are received by the company. the person entitled to receive the common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such common stock as of such conversion date, and such person or persons shall cease to be a record holder of the series a preferred stock on that date. as promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date (and in any event no later than three trading days thereafter), the company shall issue the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon conversion, with any fractional shares (after aggregating all series a preferred stock being converted on such date) rounded to the nearest whole share. such delivery shall be made, at the option of the applicable holder, in certificated form or by book-entry. any such certificate or certificates shall be delivered by the company to the appropriate holder on a book-entry basis or by mailing certificates evidencing the shares to the holders at their respective addresses as set forth in the conversion notice. (b) common stock reserved for issuance. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued common stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock, such number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding. any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock shall be (i) duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) shall rank pari passu with the other shares of common stock outstanding from time to time and (iii) shall be approved for listing on the principal national securities exchange or market on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading (including any over-the-counter market). (c) taxes . the company shall pay any and all transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of series a preferred stock. the company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that in which the series a preferred stock so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the company the amount of any such tax, or has established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. section 8 dilution adjustments. the conversion rate shall be adjusted from time to time (successively and for each event described) by the company as follows: 11 (a) if the company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, issue shares of common stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of common stock, or if the company effects a share split or share combination in respect of the common stock, then the conversion rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: where cr 0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the close of business on the effective date of such share split or combination, as applicable; cr ' = the new conversion rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the close of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable; os 0 = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the close of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable; and os ' = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or the close of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable. the company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in treasury by the company. (b) except as otherwise provided for by section 8(c), if the company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of common stock any options, rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days from the record date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the closing price of the common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the record date of such distribution, the conversion rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 12 where cr 0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution; cr ' = the new conversion rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such distribution; os 0 = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution; x = the total number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to such options, rights or warrants; and y = the number of shares of common stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such options, rights or warrants divided by the average closing price of the common stock over the 10 consecutive trading day period ending on the record date. to the extent that shares of common stock are not delivered pursuant to any such options, rights or warrants that are non-transferable upon the expiration or termination of such options, rights or warrants, the conversion rate shall be readjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such options, rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such options, rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors. (c) if the company, at any time or from time to time while any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its common stock shares of any class of capital stock of the company, cash, evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire capital stock or other securities, but excluding (i) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment under section 8(a) or section 8(b) shall apply, (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash to the extent that the series a preferred stock participates on an as-converted basis with the common stock in a cash dividend or distribution in accordance with section 4(a), and (iii) spinoffs to which the provision set forth below in this section 8(c) shall apply (any of such shares of capital stock, cash, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire common stock or other 13 securities, hereinafter in this section 8(c) called the &ldquo; distributed property &rdquo;), then, in each such case the conversion rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: where cr 0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution; cr ' = the new conversion rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such distribution; sp 0 = the average closing price of the common stock over the 10 consecutive trading day period ending on the record date for such distribution; and fmv = (i) for cash dividends or distributions, the amount of cash distributed and (ii) for other distributed property, the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors) of the portion of distributed property, in each case, with respect to each outstanding share of common stock on the record date for such distribution. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed property so distributed applicable to one share of common stock is equal to or greater than sp 0 as set forth above (a &ldquo; liquidating distribution &rdquo;), then in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the company shall distribute to each holder of series a preferred stock on the date such distributed property is distributed to holders of common stock, but without requiring such holder to convert its shares of series a preferred stock, the amount of distributed property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of common stock equal to the per share amount on the record date fixed for determination for shareholders entitled to receive such liquidating distribution; provided , however , that the company shall not distribute distributed property to either the holders of the common stock or the preferred stock to the extent such distribution would be prohibited by any provision of any debt document. if the board of directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this section 8(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market price of the common stock for purposes of calculating sp 0 in the formula in this section 8(c). with respect to an adjustment pursuant to this section 8(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the common stock consisting of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of 14 the company (a &ldquo; spin-off &rdquo;), the conversion rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the 10 th trading day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off shall be increased based on the following formula: where cr 0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the 10 th trading day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off; cr ' = the new conversion rate in effect from and after the close of business on the 10 th trading day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off; fmv = the average of the closing prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of common stock applicable to one share of common stock over the 10 consecutive trading day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off; and mp 0 = the average closing price of the common stock over the 10 consecutive trading day period calculated immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off. such adjustment shall occur on the 10 th trading day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the spin-off. for purposes of this section 8(c), section 8(a) and section 8(b) hereof, any dividend or distribution to which this section 8(c) is applicable that also includes shares of common stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock to which section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of common stock or rights or warrants to which section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (and any conversion rate adjustment required by this section 8(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of common stock or such options, rights or warrants to which section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (and any further conversion rate adjustment required by section 8(a) and 8(b) hereof with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (a) the close of business on the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted for &ldquo;the close of business on the record date,&rdquo; &ldquo;the close of business on the record date or the close of business on the effective date,&rdquo; &ldquo;after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution or the close of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination&rdquo; and &ldquo;the close of business on the record date for such distribution&rdquo; within the 15 meaning of section 8(a) and 8(b) hereof and (b) any shares of common stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed &ldquo;outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on the record date or the close of business on the effective date&rdquo; within the meaning of section 8(a) hereof. if the company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, distribute options, rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of common stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which options, rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (&ldquo; trigger event &rdquo;): (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of common stock; (y) are not exercisable; and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of common stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this section 8(c), (and no adjustment to the conversion rate under this section 8(c) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest trigger event and a distribution or deemed distribution under the terms of such options, rights or warrants at which time an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the conversion rate shall be made in the same manner as provided for under this section 8(c). if any such options, rights or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such options, rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new options, rights or warrants for purposes of this section 8(c) (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). in addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of options, rights or warrants (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the conversion rate under this section 8(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such options, rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the conversion rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or trigger event, as the case may be, as though it were a distribution under this section 8(c), equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of common stock with respect to such options, rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such options, rights or warrants), made to all holders of common stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such options, rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the conversion rate shall be readjusted as if such options, rights or warrants had not been issued. (d) if the company, during the eighteen month period following the original issue date, shall issue shares of common stock or any other security convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock (such common stock or other security, &ldquo; equity-linked securities &rdquo;), for a consideration per share of common stock (or conversion price per share of common stock) less than the current market price of common stock on the date the company fixes the offering price (or conversion price) of equity-linked securities, the conversion rate shall be increased based on the following formula: 16 where: cr 0 = the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such equity-linked securities; cr ' = the new conversion rate in effect immediately after the issuance of such equity-linked securities; ac = the aggregate consideration paid or payable for such equity linked securities; os 0 = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such equity-linked securities; os ' = the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of such equity-linked securities or issuable pursuant to such equity-linked securities; and sp ' = the closing price of the common stock on the date of issuance of such equity-linked securities. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after such issuance. this section 8(d) shall not apply to excluded issuances. (e) the company may make increases in the conversion rate, in addition to any other increases required by this section 8, if the board of directors (by action of a majority of the directors that are neither &ldquo;investor designees&rdquo; (as defined in the investor rights agreement) nor preferred directors (&ldquo; independent majority &rdquo;)) deems it advisable and necessary to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the common stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of common stock (or issuance of options, rights or warrants for common stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason provided, however, that if there are any investor designees or preferred directors on the board of directors at such time, the company may not take such action without the approval of the investor designees and preferred directors, which approval may only be withheld if the investor designees and preferred directors reasonably determine that such action is likely to result in a material increase in u.s. federal income tax or withholding tax to holders of series a preferred stock. if the company takes any action affecting the common stock, other than an action described in sections 8(a) though 8(d), which upon a determination by the board of directors by action of an independent majority, such determination intended to be a &ldquo;fact&rdquo; for purposes of 17 section 151(a) of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, would materially adversely affect the conversion rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock, the conversion rate shall be increased, to the extent permitted by law, in such manner, if any, and at such time, as the board of directors by action of an independent majority determines in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances. section 9 voting rights .

(h) no change to warrant . this warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to section 5 . (i) other events . if any event shall occur affecting the company as to which none of the provisions of preceding subsections of this section 5 are strictly applicable, but which would require an adjustment to the terms of this warrant in order to (i) avoid an adverse impact on this warrant and (ii) effectuate the intent and purpose of this section 5 , then the board shall make an appropriate adjustment in the warrant price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant so as to protect the rights of the holder in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section 5 ; provided, that no such adjustment pursuant to this section 5(i) shall increase the warrant price or decrease the number of shares of common 7 stock issuable as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 5 or otherwise adversely impact the holder. 6. transfers .
