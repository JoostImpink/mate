adjustments for additional issuances of common stock . in the event that the maker at any time after the first closing date issues additional shares of common stock (including additional shares of common stock deemed to be issued) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect, then the conversion price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance, to a price (calculated to the nearest hundredth of one cent) equal to the consideration per share received by the maker upon such issuance of additional shares of common stock. for purposes of this section 3.4, shares of common stock shall be deemed to be issued if the maker or any of its subsidiaries issues additional shares of common stock or rights, warrants, options or other securities or debt convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock or otherwise entitling any person to acquire shares of common stock (collectively, &#8220; common stock equivalents &#8221;). for purposes of this section 3.4, in connection with any issuance or deemed issuance of any common stock, (a)&#160;the maximum number of shares of common stock potentially issuable at any time upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such common stock equivalents (the &#8220; deemed number &#8221;) the shall be deemed to be outstanding upon issuance of such common stock equivalents, (b)&#160;the consideration deemed to have been received by the maker applicable to such common stock shall equal the minimum dollar value of consideration payable to the maker to purchase such common stock equivalents and to convert, exercise or exchange them into common stock (net of any discounts, fees, commissions and other expenses), divided by the deemed number, and (c)&#160;no further adjustment shall be made to the conversion price upon the actual issuance of common stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such common stock equivalents. &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustments for subdivisions, common stock dividends, combinations or consolidations of common stock . in the event the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided or increased, by stock split or stock dividend, into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price then in effect shall concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision or payment of such stock dividend, be proportionately decreased. in the event the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of common stock, the conversion price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased. &#160; -7- &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustments for reclassification, exchange and substitution . if the common stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination or shares provided for above), the conversion price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the common stock issuable upon conversion of this note shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of common stock which the holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of common stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holder upon conversion of this note immediately before that change. &#160; (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; adjustments for merger, sale, lease or conveyance . in the event of any consolidation with or merger of the maker with or into another entity, or in case of any sale, lease or conveyance to another person or entity of the assets of the maker as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the common stock issuable upon conversion of this note shall after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the common stock issuable (at the time of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance) upon conversion of this note would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable on the conversion of this note. &#160; (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; other provisions applicable to adjustment under this section . the following provisions will be applicable to the adjustments in conversion price as provided in this section 3.4: &#160; (1) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include any shares thereof then directly or indirectly owned or held by or for the account of the maker. &#160; (2) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; in case the maker shall take any action affecting the outstanding number of shares of common stock other than an action described in any of the foregoing subsections above, inclusive, which would have an inequitable effect on the holder, the conversion price shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the board of directors of the maker on the advice of the maker&#8217;s independent public accountants may in good faith determine to be equitable in the circumstances. &#160; (3) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made if the amount of any such adjustment would be an amount less than one percent (1%) of the conversion price then in effect, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereof shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate an increase or decrease of one percent (1%) or more. &#160; -8- (4) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the conversion price shall not be adjusted upward except in the event of a combination of the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; record date . in the event that the maker shall propose at any time: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; to declare any dividend or distribution (other than by purchase of common stock of employees, officers and directors pursuant to the termination of such persons or pursuant to the maker&#8217;s exercise of rights of first refusal with respect to common stock held by such persons) upon its common stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus; &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its common stock shares outstanding involving a change in the common stock; or &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; to merge or consolidate with or into any other entity, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in connection with each such event, this maker shall send to the holder: &#160; (1) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; at least twenty (20) days&#8217; prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend or distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (i) and (ii) above; and &#160; (2) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; in the case of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above, at least twenty (20) days&#8217; prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event). &#160; each such written notice shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holder at the address first set forth above. any such action shall at all times be subject to the voting rights and other rights, preferences and privileges of the holder set forth herein. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; no impairment . the maker shall not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action (other than actions taken in good faith), avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the maker but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all the provisions of this section 3.4 and in taking all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holder against impairment. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; certificates as to adjustments . upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this section, the maker at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to the holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the maker shall, upon the written request at any time of the holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to the holder a like certificate setting forth (a)&#160;such adjustments and readjustments, (b)&#160;the conversion price at the time in effect, and (c)&#160;the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of this note. &#160; -9- &#160; (e) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; issue taxes . the maker shall pay any and all issue and other taxes, excluding federal, state or local income taxes, that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of this note pursuant thereto; provided , however , that the maker shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by the holder in connection with any such conversion. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; fractional shares . no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of this note. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the maker shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing bid price of the common stock into which this note is convertible for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. the term &#8220; closing bid price &#8221; shall mean, on any particular date (i) the last closing bid price per share of the common stock on such date on the otc bulletin board or another registered national stock exchange on which the common stock is then listed, or if there is no such price on such date, then the last closing bid price on such exchange or quotation system on the date nearest preceding such date, or (ii) if the common stock is not listed then on the otc bulletin board or any registered national stock exchange, the last trading price for a share of common stock in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the otc bulletin board or in the national quotation bureau incorporated or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices) at the close of business on such date, or (iii) if the common stock is not then reported by the otc bulletin board or the national quotation bureau incorporated (or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), then the average of the &#8220;pink sheet&#8221; quotes for the relevant conversion period, as determined in good faith by the holder, or (iv) if the common stock is not then publicly traded the fair market value of a share of common stock as determined by the holder and reasonably acceptable to the maker. &#160; (g) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; reservation of common stock . &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; in the event that at anytime when this note shall be outstanding, the maker shall not have sufficient authorized but unissued common stock for the purpose of effecting the conversion of all amounts outstanding under this note at such time (without regard to any limitations on conversion) (an &#8220; authorized share failure &#8221;), it shall immediately reserve and keep available such number of its duly authorized shares of common stock as is in fact available as of that date and shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the number of its authorized shares of common stock until such time as the maker&#8217;s certificate of incorporation shall have been amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to such number as would, at a minimum, permit the reservation by the maker of sufficient shares to allow conversion of all amounts outstanding under this note as provided herein. &#160; -10- without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the maker shall (a) hold a meeting of its stockholders or (b) obtain a majority written consent of its stockholders, for the authorization of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the maker shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders&#8217; approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. the inability of the maker to reserve the required number of shares of common stock required by this section 3.4(g) shall have no impact on the rank, rights, preferences and privileges of this note, which shall be interpreted and applied as if the maker had sufficient shares of common stock authorized but unissued to effect any conversion. before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note or which would cause the effective purchase price for the common stock to be less than the par value of the shares of common stock, the maker shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the maker may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of such common stock at such adjusted conversion price or effective purchase price, as the case may be. &#160; (h) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; regulatory compliance . if any shares of common stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of this note require registration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law or regulation or otherwise before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the maker shall, at its sole cost and expense, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, endeavor to secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be. &#160; section 3.5 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; preemptive rights . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; except as set forth in section 3.5(c), the maker shall not issue or sell any shares of common stock or other securities, or any rights or options to purchase common stock or other securities, or any debt or shares convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or other securities, whether now or hereafter authorized and whether unissued or in the treasury (collectively, &#8220; preemptive shares &#8221;), unless the holder shall first have been given the right to acquire, at a price no less favorable than that at which such preemptive shares are to be offered to others, a portion of the preemptive shares, as provided in section 3.5(b). &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the maker shall give the holder prior written notice of any proposed issuance or sale described in section 3.5(a), including the price at which such securities are to be offered and the time period for the offering, and the holder shall have thirty (30) days from the giving of such notice within which to elect to acquire that number of the preemptive shares equal to the product of the total number of preemptive shares being offered and a fraction, determined as of the time immediately prior to the issuance of the preemptive shares, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (i)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding as a result of the conversion of this note, and (ii)&#160;the number of shares of common stock into which this note could be converted, and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of (x)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, (y)&#160;the number of shares of &#160; -11- common stock into which this note could be converted, and (z)&#160;the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other rights for the purchase of capital stock of the company, and all outstanding shares of all series of preferred stock (such number of preemptive shares being referred to herein as the &#8220; common stock preemptive shares &#8221;). the holder may acquire that portion of the common stock preemptive shares being offered equal to its percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock immediately preceding the issuance of the preemptive shares. if any transaction specified by the maker in any such notice shall not be consummated within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such notice, the corporation shall again comply with the provisions of this section 3.5 with respect to such transaction, and the holder shall again have preemptive rights hereunder with respect to the transaction, regardless of whether any such stockholder had previously exercised or failed to exercise such rights. any purchase of securities pursuant to the exercise of preemptive rights shall be consummated simultaneously with, and shall be conditioned upon, consummation of the transaction proposed by the maker. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the restrictions contained in, and preemptive rights granted under, this section 3.5 shall not apply to: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; shares of common stock issued upon conversion of this note; &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; shares of capital stock of the maker issued in a public offering occurring after the date hereof that results in aggregate gross proceeds to the maker of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000); or &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; shares of common stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or other common stock equivalents in existence on the issuance date. &#160;

authorized share failure &#8221;), it shall immediately reserve and keep available such number of its duly authorized shares of common stock as is in fact available as of that date and shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the number of its authorized shares of common stock until such time as the maker&#8217;s certificate of incorporation shall have been amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to such number as would, at a minimum, permit the reservation by the maker of sufficient shares to allow conversion of all amounts outstanding under this note as provided herein. without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the maker shall (a) hold a meeting of its stockholders or (b) obtain a majority written consent of its stockholders, for the authorization of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the maker shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders&#8217; approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. the inability of the maker to reserve the required number of shares of common stock required by this section 3.4(g) shall have no impact on the rank, rights, preferences and privileges of this note, which shall be interpreted and applied as if the maker had sufficient shares of common stock authorized but unissued to effect any conversion. before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note or which would cause the effective purchase price for the common stock to be less than the par value of the shares of common stock, the maker shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the maker may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of such common stock at such adjusted conversion price or effective purchase price, as the case may be. &#160; -10- &#160; (h) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; regulatory compliance . if any shares of common stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of this note require registration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law or regulation or otherwise before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the maker shall, at its sole cost and expense, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, endeavor to secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be. &#160;

preemptive shares &#8221;), unless the holder shall first have been given the right to acquire, at a price no less favorable than that at which such preemptive shares are to be offered to others, a portion of the preemptive shares, as provided in section 3.5(b). &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the maker shall give the holder prior written notice of any proposed issuance or sale described in section 3.5(a), including the price at which such securities are to be offered and the time period for the offering, and the holder shall have thirty (30) days from the giving of such notice within which to elect to acquire that number of the preemptive shares equal to the product of the total number of preemptive shares being offered and a fraction, determined as of the time immediately prior to the issuance of the preemptive shares, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (i)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding as a result of the conversion of this note, and (ii)&#160;the number of shares of common stock into which this note could be converted, and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of (x)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, (y)&#160;the number of shares of common stock into which this note could be converted, and (z)&#160;the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other rights for the purchase of capital stock of the company, and all outstanding shares of all series of preferred stock (such number of preemptive shares being referred to herein as the &#8220; common stock preemptive shares &#8221;). the holder may acquire that portion of the common stock preemptive shares being offered equal to its percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock immediately preceding the issuance of the preemptive shares. if any transaction specified by the maker in any such notice shall not be consummated within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such notice, the corporation shall again comply with the provisions of this section 3.5 with respect to such transaction, and the holder shall again have preemptive rights hereunder with respect to the transaction, regardless of whether any such stockholder had previously exercised or failed to exercise such rights. any purchase of securities pursuant to the exercise of preemptive rights shall be consummated simultaneously with, and shall be conditioned upon, consummation of the transaction proposed by the maker. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the restrictions contained in, and preemptive rights granted under, this section 3.5 shall not apply to: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; shares of common stock issued upon conversion of this note;

&#160; in case the maker shall take any action affecting the outstanding number of shares of common stock other than an action described in any of the foregoing subsections above, inclusive, which would have an inequitable effect on the holder, the conversion price shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the board of directors of the maker on the advice of the maker&#8217;s independent public accountants may in good faith determine to be equitable in the circumstances. &#160; (3) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made if the amount of any such adjustment would be an amount less than one percent (1%) of the conversion price then in effect, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereof shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate an increase or decrease of one percent (1%) or more. &#160;

each such written notice shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holder at the address first set forth above. any such action shall at all times be subject to the voting rights and other rights, preferences and privileges of the holder set forth herein. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; no impairment . the maker shall not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action (other than actions taken in good faith), avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the maker but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all the provisions of this section 3.4 and in taking all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holder against impairment. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; certificates as to adjustments . upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this section, the maker at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to the holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the maker shall, upon the written request at any time of the holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to the holder a like certificate setting forth (a)&#160;such adjustments and readjustments, (b)&#160;the conversion price at the time in effect, and (c)&#160;the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of this note. &#160; -9- (e) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; issue taxes . the maker shall pay any and all issue and other taxes, excluding federal, state or local income taxes, that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of this note pursuant thereto; provided , however , that the maker shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by the holder in connection with any such conversion. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; fractional shares . no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of this note. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the maker shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing bid price of the common stock into which this note is convertible for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. the term &#8220; closing bid price &#8221; shall mean, on any particular date (i) the last closing bid price per share of the common stock on such date on the otc bulletin board or another registered national stock exchange on which the common stock is then listed, or if there is no such price on such date, then the last closing bid price on such exchange or quotation system on the date nearest preceding such date, or (ii) if the common stock is not listed then on the otc bulletin board or any registered national stock exchange, the last trading price for a share of common stock in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the otc bulletin board or in the national quotation bureau incorporated or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices) at the close of business on such date, or (iii) if the common stock is not then reported by the otc bulletin board or the national quotation bureau incorporated (or similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), then the average of the &#8220;pink sheet&#8221; quotes for the relevant conversion period, as determined in good faith by the holder, or (iv) if the common stock is not then publicly traded the fair market value of a share of common stock as determined by the holder and reasonably acceptable to the maker. &#160; (g) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; reservation of common stock . &#160; &#160;(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; in the event that at anytime when this note shall be outstanding, the maker shall not have sufficient authorized but unissued common stock for the purpose of effecting the conversion of all amounts outstanding under this note at such time (without regard to any limitations on conversion) (an &#8220; authorized share failure &#8221;), it shall immediately reserve and keep available such number of its duly authorized shares of common stock as is in fact available as of that date and shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the number of its authorized shares of common stock until such time as the maker&#8217;s certificate of incorporation shall have been amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to such number as would, at a minimum, permit the reservation by the maker of sufficient shares to allow conversion of all amounts outstanding under this note as provided herein. without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than 60 days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the maker shall (a) hold a meeting of its stockholders or (b) obtain a majority written consent of its stockholders, for the authorization of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the maker shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders&#8217; approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. the inability of the maker to reserve the required number of shares of common stock required by this section 3.4(g) shall have no impact on the rank, rights, preferences and privileges of this note, which shall be interpreted and applied as if the maker had sufficient &#160; -10- shares of common stock authorized but unissued to effect any conversion. before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the conversion price below the then par value of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of this note or which would cause the effective purchase price for the common stock to be less than the par value of the shares of common stock, the maker shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the maker may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of such common stock at such adjusted conversion price or effective purchase price, as the case may be. &#160; (h) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; regulatory compliance . if any shares of common stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of this note require registration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law or regulation or otherwise before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the maker shall, at its sole cost and expense, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, endeavor to secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be. &#160; section 3.5 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; preemptive rights . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; except as set forth in section 3.5(c), the maker shall not issue or sell any shares of common stock or other securities, or any rights or options to purchase common stock or other securities, or any debt or shares convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or other securities, whether now or hereafter authorized and whether unissued or in the treasury (collectively, &#8220; preemptive shares &#8221;), unless the holder shall first have been given the right to acquire, at a price no less favorable than that at which such preemptive shares are to be offered to others, a portion of the preemptive shares, as provided in section 3.5(b). &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the maker shall give the holder prior written notice of any proposed issuance or sale described in section 3.5(a), including the price at which such securities are to be offered and the time period for the offering, and the holder shall have thirty (30) days from the giving of such notice within which to elect to acquire that number of the preemptive shares equal to the product of the total number of preemptive shares being offered and a fraction, determined as of the time immediately prior to the issuance of the preemptive shares, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (i)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding as a result of the conversion of this note, and (ii)&#160;the number of shares of common stock into which this note could be converted, and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of (x)&#160;the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, (y)&#160;the number of shares of common stock into which this note could be converted, and (z)&#160;the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other rights for the purchase of capital stock of the company, and all outstanding shares of all series of preferred stock (such number of preemptive shares being referred to herein as the &#8220; common stock preemptive shares &#8221;). the holder may acquire that portion of the common stock preemptive shares being offered equal to its percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock immediately preceding the issuance of the preemptive shares. if any transaction specified by the maker in any such notice shall not be consummated within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such notice, the corporation shall again comply with the provisions of this section 3.5 with respect to such transaction, and the holder shall again have preemptive rights hereunder with respect to the transaction, regardless of whether any such stockholder had previously exercised or failed to exercise such rights. any purchase of securities pursuant to the exercise of preemptive rights shall be consummated simultaneously with, and shall be conditioned upon, consummation of the transaction proposed by the maker. &#160; -11- &#160; &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the restrictions contained in, and preemptive rights granted under, this section 3.5 shall not apply to: &#160; (i) &#160; shares of common stock issued upon conversion of this note; &#160; (ii) &#160; shares of capital stock of the maker issued in a public offering occurring after the date hereof that results in aggregate gross proceeds to the maker of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000); or &#160; (iii) &#160; shares of common stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or other common stock equivalents in existence on the issuance date. &#160; the rights granted to the holder under this section 3.5 may be waived with respect to any preemptive shares by a written waiver executed by the holder. section 3.6 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; prepayment . the maker shall not be permitted to prepay some or all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under this note at any time prior to the date that is six (6) months after the first closing date but shall be permitted to prepay some or all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under this note at any time after such date; provided, however, that (i) in advance of any such prepayment, the maker shall deliver to the holder a written notice (the &#8220; prepayment notice &#8221;) setting forth the maker&#8217;s intention to make such prepayment and the amount thereof, and (ii) the holder shall have the right to convert some or all of the amount proposed to be prepaid into such number of shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the amount to be converted by the conversion price then in effect. the holder shall exercise the conversion right set forth in this section 3.6 by notifying the maker in writing within sixty (60) trading days of the holder&#8217;s receipt of prepayment notice. in the event that the maker prepays some, but not all, of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under this note, such prepaid amount shall be applied first to the amount owing on the date on which the maker&#8217;s final payment is due hereunder and then to amounts owing on any preceding dates on which the maker is required to make payments hereunder. &#160; section 3.7 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; no rights as shareholder . nothing contained in this note shall be construed as conferring upon the holder, prior to the conversion of this note, the right to vote or to receive dividends or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect of any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors of the maker or of any other matter, or any other rights as a shareholder of the maker. &#160;

-8- misleading; provided , however , that company shall not be liable to a particular holder in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any omission, if such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such holder furnished to company in writing by or on behalf of such holder specifically for use in the preparation of the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of a holder and shall survive the transfer of such securities. the foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which company may otherwise have to each holder, its officers and directors, members employees, partners and managers, as the case may be, underwriters of the registrable securities or any controlling person of the foregoing; provided , further , that, as to any underwriter or any person controlling any underwriter, this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in any preliminary prospectus if a copy of a prospectus was not sent or given by or on behalf of an underwriter to such person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or action at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities as required by the securities act and such untrue statement or omission had been corrected in such prospectus. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; in the case of each offering made pursuant to this agreement, each holder of registrable securities included in such offering, by exercising its registration rights hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless company, its officers, directors, agents and affiliates and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of the securities act (and if requested by the underwriters, each underwriter who participates in the offering and each person, if any, who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, expenses and judgments, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, including any amount paid in settlement of any litigation commenced or threatened, and shall promptly reimburse them, as and when incurred, for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating any claims and defending any actions, insofar as any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions shall arise out of, or shall be based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact relating to the holder required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement of a material fact is contained in, or such material fact relating to the holder is omitted from, information relating to such holder furnished in writing to company by or on behalf of such holder specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement (or in any preliminary or final prospectus included therein). the foregoing indemnity is in addition to any liability which such holder may otherwise have to company, or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons; provided , however , that, as to any underwriter or any person controlling any underwriter, this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in any preliminary prospectus if a copy of a prospectus was not sent to or given by or on behalf of an underwriter to such person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or action at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities as required by the securities act and such untrue statement or omission had been corrected in such prospectus. in no event shall the liability of any holder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. &#160; -9- &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; procedure for indemnification . each party indemnified under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 7 shall, promptly after receipt of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof; provided that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party on account of the indemnity agreement contained in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 7, except to the extent the indemnifying party was prejudiced by such failure, and in no event shall relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability which it may have to such indemnified party. if any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that each indemnified party, its employees, officers and directors, if any, and each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the securities act, shall have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably approved by the indemnifying party to represent them if the named parties to any action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and an indemnifying party or an affiliate of an indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel either (i) that there are one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to such indemnifying party or such affiliate or (ii) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and such indemnifying party or such affiliate, and in that event the fees and expenses of one such separate counsel for all such indemnified parties shall be paid by the indemnifying party. an indemnified party will not enter into any settlement agreement which is not approved by the indemnifying party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. the indemnifying party may not agree to any settlement of any such claim or action which provides for any remedy or relief other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. in any action hereunder as to which the indemnifying party has assumed the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall not be obligated hereunder to reimburse the indemnified party for the costs thereof. in all instances, the indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party or its counsel in the defense of each claim or action. &#160; -10- &#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to herein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand or the indemnified party on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, but not by reference to any indemnified party&#8217;s stock ownership in company. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this paragraph shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this paragraph, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the foregoing, no holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such holder from the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; 8. &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; rule 144 . company shall take such measures and timely file such information, documents and reports as shall be required by the sec as a condition to the availability of rule 144 and to remain in compliance with the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. &#160;

provided, however, that airworks shall have the right to assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to any individual or entity owning a partnership interest of airworks. &#160; &#160; 10.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; limitations on subsequent registration rights . from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holder or holders of 51% of the registrable securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company that would allow such holder or prospective holder (i) to include such securities in any registration unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the registrable securities of the holders that are included or (ii) to demand registration of any securities held by such holder or prospective holder . &#160;

(b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; severability . if any term or provision of this agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and each of the parties shall use its best efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term or provision. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; further assurances . subject to the specific terms of this agreement, each of the parties hereto shall make, execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments and documents, and take all such other actions, as may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; waivers, etc . no failure or delay on the part of either party (or the intended third-party beneficiaries referred to herein) in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. no modification or waiver of any provision of this agreement nor consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of each of the parties, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. &#160;
