(ii) the certificate(s) representing the subscriber shares will bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form: "the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933. the shares have been acquired for investment, and may not be sold or transferred in the absence of an effective registration statement for the shares under 2 the securities act of 1933 and such blue sky laws as might be applicable, unless an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the company first be obtained that such is not then necessary." section 4. certain representations. each subscriber hereby severally represents and warrants to the company as follows: (a) investment intent. the subscriber shares are being acquired for the subscriber's own account for the subscriber's own investment and not on behalf of other persons and not with a view to, or for the sale in connection with, the distribution thereof.

act other than (a) a registration primarily for sales of securities to employees of the company or resales thereof, (b) a registration primarily for sales of securities issued upon exercise of options or warrants outstanding or (c) a registration in connection with a merger or other business combination. each subscriber agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of the subscriber shares

registering subscribers substantially to the same extent as is customary for indemnification and contribution in favor of selling shareholders of similar offerings and the registering subscribers will
