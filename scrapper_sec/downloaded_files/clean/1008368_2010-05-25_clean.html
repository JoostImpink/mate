(a) &#160; in the case of convertible securities or options for common stock, the only additional shares of common issued were the shares of common stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the company for the issue of such exercised options plus the consideration actually received by the company upon such exercise or for the issue of all such convertible securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the company upon such conversion or exchange, and &#160; (b) &#160; in the case of options for convertible securities, only the convertible securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such options, and the consideration received by the company for the additional shares of common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the company for the issue of such exercised options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the company (determined pursuant to section 5(d)(vii)) upon the issue of the convertible securities with respect to which such options were actually exercised; and &#160; (5) &#160; if such record date shall have been fixed and such options or convertible securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the conversion price specified for such shares of series d preferred stock which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter such conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 5(d)(v) as of the actual date of their issuance. &#160; (vii) &#160; adjustment of conversion price upon issuance of additional shares of common .&#160;&#160;in the event the company shall issue additional shares of common (including additional shares of common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 5(d)(v)) without consideration or for consideration actually received per share less than the applicable conversion price specified for such shares of series d preferred stock in effect on the date of &#160;

and provided further that the failure of any inde mnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2.6, to the extent such failure is not materially prejudicial.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. all reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section 2.6) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within ten business days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the indemnifying party may require such indemnified party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). &#160; (d) &#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.6 is held by &#160; a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided , however , that no contribution by any holder payable pursuant to this &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; section 2.6(d) shall exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company, the investor representative and the investors agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.6(d) were determined &#160; by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 2.6(d). notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnified party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from an indemnifying party not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160;
