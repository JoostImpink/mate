shuttle &#148;), entered into an agreement of merger dated as of february 20, 2007 (the &#147; merger agreement &#148;). under the terms of the merger agreement, shire will commence a cash tender offer (the &#147; offer &#148;) to acquire all of new river&#146;s outstanding shares, at a price of &#36;64.00 per share (the &#147; offer price &#148;). following the completion of the offer and the satisfaction and waiver of certain conditions in the merger agreement, shuttle will be merged into new river (the &#147; merger &#148;) with new river continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of shire. at the effective time of the merger, any remaining outstanding shares not tendered in the offer (other than (i) shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of new river and any shares owned by shire, shuttle page 3 of 8 or any wholly owned subsidiary of shire, which shall be cancelled, or (ii) shares owned by new river shareholders who properly demanded appraisal under the virginia stock corporation act of the commonwealth of virginia) will be converted into the right to receive &#36;64.00 per share or any greater per share price paid in the offer in cash, without interest thereon. the merger agreement provides that all options to acquire shares and all stock appreciation rights outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether or not fully vested and exercisable, will, at the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and each holder of an option or stock appreciation right will be entitled to receive a cash amount (subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the excess, if any, of the per share amount paid in the offer over the per share exercise price of such option or stock appreciation right, as applicable, multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such option or subject to such stock appreciation right, as applicable. following the effective time of the merger, it is contemplated that the shares will cease to be listed on the nasdaq global market and will become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. upon the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the merger agreement provides that shire will be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to the new river board of directors that is in the same proportion as the percentage of shares beneficially owned by shire to the total number of shares outstanding. new river is required under the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to cause shire&#146;s designees to be elected or appointed to the new river board of directors. new river will also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated by shire to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on each committee of the new river board of directors and the board of directors of each subsidiary of new river (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the new river board of directors. the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer a number of shares, which, together with all other shares then beneficially owned by shire, shuttle or their controlled affiliates, represents at least a majority of the total number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which means, as of any time, the number of shares outstanding, together with all shares which new river would be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options, or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares), (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer under the hart&#45;scott&#45;rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (iii) the approval by a simple majority at a meeting of shire shareholders of the acquisition of new river on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and an increase of the existing limit on group borrowings in shire&#146;s articles of association. as part of the merger agreement, new river granted to shuttle and shire an option to purchase up to a number of shares from new river at a per share purchase price equal to the offer price that, when added to the number of shares owned by shuttle and shire immediately following consummation of the offer, results in shuttle and shire owning 90% of the fully&#45;diluted shares (the &#147; top&#45;up option &#148;). the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the top&#45;up option, however, is limited to the number of shares authorized and available for issuance and, in any event, the top&#45;up option cannot be exercised to the extent the issuance would require shareholder approval under the rules of the nasdaq stock market. if the top&#45;up option is exercised by shuttle (resulting in shuttle owning 90% or more of the outstanding shares), shuttle will be able to effect, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, a short&#45;form merger under the virginia stock corporation act. the foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which was filed as exhibit 2.1 on shire&#146;s current report on form 8&#45;k filed on february 23, 2007. page 4 of 8 tender and support agreement as an inducement for shire to enter into the merger agreement, shire entered into the tender and support agreement with the supporting shareholders with respect to all of the shares beneficially owned by such supporting shareholders. shares beneficially owned by the supporting shareholders have not been purchased by shire, and thus no funds were used for such purpose. shire did not pay any additional consideration to the supporting shareholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the tender and support agreement. pursuant to the tender and support agreement, each supporting shareholder agreed to validly tender (or cause to be tendered) in the offer all of such supporting shareholder&#146;s shares pursuant to the terms of the offer as promptly as practicable (but no later than the close of business on the 17 th business day) after commencement of the offer. in furtherance of the foregoing, each supporting shareholder has agreed to (i) deliver to the depositary (a) a letter of transmittal with respect to such supporting shareholder&#146;s shares complying with the terms of the offer, (b) a certificate or certificates representing such shares or an &#147;agent&#146;s message&#148; (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the depositary may reasonably request) in the case of a book&#45;entry transfer of any uncertificated shares and (c) all other documents or instruments required to be delivered by other shareholders of new river pursuant to the terms of the offer, and/or (ii) instruct its broker or such other person that is the holder of record of any shares to tender such shares pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the offer. each supporting shareholder has further agreed that once its shares are tendered, such supporting shareholder will not withdraw or cause to be withdrawn any of such shares from the offer, unless the tender and support agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms. the tender and support agreement further provides that each supporting shareholder will, at any meeting of the holders of shares, vote (or cause to be voted) (i) in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and each of the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) against (a) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to frustrate the purposes of, impede, hinder, interfere with, or prevent or delay or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (b) any takeover proposal (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) and any action in furtherance thereof, (c) any reorganization, recapitalization or winding&#45;up of new river or any other extraordinary transaction involving new river or (d) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of new river under the merger agreement or of such supporting shareholder under the tender and support agreement. in furtherance of the supporting shareholders covenants under the tender and support agreement, the supporting shareholders agreed, for a period beginning on the date of the tender and support agreement and continuing until the termination of the tender and support agreement, to appoint shire as the supporting shareholders&#146; attorney&#45;in&#45;fact and proxy, with full power of substitution, to vote the supporting shareholders&#146; shares in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and against the actions described in clause (ii) the immediately preceding sentence. each supporting shareholder agreed pursuant to the tender and support agreement not to, without the prior written consent of shire, directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies, powers of attorney, rights of first offer or refusal or enter into any voting trust with respect to, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, sell, assign, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, grant a participation interest in, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, (iii) otherwise permit any liens to be created on, or (iv) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, grant of a participation interest in, hypothecation or other disposition of, any shares such supporting shareholder beneficially owns during the term of the tender and support agreement. in addition, the supporting shareholders are prohibited to seek or solicit any such sale, assignment, transfer, encumbrance or other disposition or any such contract, option or other arrangement or understanding, and each supporting shareholders agrees to notify shire promptly, and to provide all details requested by shire, if it is approached or solicited, directly or indirectly, by any person or entity with respect to any of the foregoing. page 5 of 8 the tender and support agreement terminates on the earlier to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger, (ii) the agreement of the parties to terminate the tender and support agreement and (iii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. the foregoing description of the tender and support agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the tender and support agreement, which was filed as exhibit 99.1 to shire&#146;s current report on form 8&#45;k filed on february 23, 2007. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) as a result of the tender and support agreement, shire may be deemed for the purposes of rule 13d &#8211;
