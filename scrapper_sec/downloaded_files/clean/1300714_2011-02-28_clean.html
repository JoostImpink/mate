(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any indemnitee, such indemnitee shall promptly notify the company in writing, and the company &#160; &#160; -47- &#160; &#160; shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnitee and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve the company of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this agreement, except to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the company.&#160;&#160;an indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnitee or indemnitees unless: (1) the company has agreed in writing to p ay such fees and expenses; (2) the company shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnitee in any such proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnitee and the company, and such indemnitee shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest exists if the same counsel were to represent such indemnitee and the company; provided, that the company shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all indemnitees. the company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnitee, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any indemnitee is a party, unless such settlement includes an uncon ditional release of such indemnitee from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.&#160;&#160;subject to the terms of this agreement, all fees and expenses of the indemnitee (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section 3.12(g)(ii)) shall be paid to the indemnitee, as incurred, within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof to the company; provided, that the indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the company for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for which such indemnitee is finally judicially determined to not be entitled to indemnification hereunder).&#160;&#160;the failure to deliver written notice to the company within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve the company of any liability to the indemnitee under this section 3.12(g), except to the extent that the company is mate rially and adversely prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the indemnification provided for in section 3.12(g)(i) is unavailable to an indemnitee with respect to any losses or is insufficient to hold the indemnitee harmless as contemplated therein, then the company, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnitee as a result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnitee, on the one hand, and the company, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and of the indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or by the indemnitee and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; the company and each holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 3.12(g)(iii) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable &#160; &#160; -48- &#160; &#160; considerations referred to in section 3.12(g)(i). no indemnitee guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from the company if the company was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160;
