(c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; any person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that any failure to give notice pursuant to this subsection 4.2(c) shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 4.2 unless such failure to give notice results in material prejudice against such indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, acting reasonably. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless: (i) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defence of such suit on behalf of the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time; (ii) the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (iii) the named parties include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (iv) the named parties to any such suit or proceeding include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party has reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defences available to the indemnified party which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defence of such suit or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party and shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate law firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. no indemnifying party may settle any claims without the express written consent of an indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed where such consent does not contain any admission of liability, includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from any liabilities arising out of such claim and has as its only obligation on the indemnified party the payment of funds for which the indemnifying party has unconditionally agreed to provide indemnity under this section 4.2). (d) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the indemnification provided for under this agreement will survive the expiry of this agreement and will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and will survive any transfer of securities pursuant thereto. in the event the indemnification is unavailable in whole or in part for any reason under this section 4.2, the corporation and the holders shall contribute to the aggregate of all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the corporation and the holders in connection with the event giving rise to liability. no person that has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment to have engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, fraudulent misrepresentation or negligence shall be entitled to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to subsection 4.2(b) or this subsection 4.2(d), as applicable, from any person who has not also been so determined to have engaged in such fraud, willful misconduct, fraudulent misrepresentation or negligence.

(b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the corporation shall be entitled to postpone the filing of a prospectus supplement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant hereto (but not the preparation of such prospectus supplement) or may request holders suspend the use of any prospectus supplement that has been filed by it pursuant hereto if a demand registration request is received prior to the expiration of any lock-up period as defined in subsection 5.1(a). article 6 third-party registration rights 6.1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
