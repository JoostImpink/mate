connecticut 06904-2351. this statement is also filed by n acquisition corporation, a delaware corpora- tion and a wholly owned subsidiary of general re ("sub"). the address of the principal executive offices of sub is the same as that for general re. sub was organized on june 27, 1996 for the purpose of acquiring national re. general re and sub are collec- tively referred to as the "reporting persons." schedule i attached hereto sets forth certain additional information with respect to each director and executive officer of general re. schedule ii attached hereto sets forth certain additional information with respect to each director and execu- tive officer of sub. none of the reporting persons nor, to the best of their knowledge, any person listed in schedules i and ii hereto, has been during the last five years (a) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (b) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administra- tive body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject

stockholders (as defined below) by the reporting persons in connection with the execution and delivery of the stockholders' agreements (as defined below). item 4. purpose of the transaction. on july 1, 1996, general re and sub entered into an agree- ment and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") with national re, pursuant to which national re would merge with and into sub, with sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of general re (the "merger"). a copy of the merger agreement is filed as exhibit 1 to this statement and is incorporated herein by refer- ence. pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of national re common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (the "effective time") will (except for shares of national re common stock held by national re as treasury stock or owned by general re or any subsidiary of general re immediately prior to the effective time and shares as to which dissenters rights have been exercised in accordance with and subject to the provisions of delaware law) be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder and subject to the limita- tions set forth in the merger agreement, either: (i) a fraction of a share of general re common stock, par value $.50 per share (the "general re common stock"), together with the attached general re preferred stock purchase rights, determined by divid- ing $53 by the average of the closing prices per share of general re common stock on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") as reported by the nyse composite tape for the ten consecutive nyse trading days ending on the second nyse trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the merger, but not more than .39259 shares of general re common stock nor less than .32121 shares of general re common stock, or (ii) $53 in cash, without any interest thereon. the merger agreement provides for a minimum stock component of 50%. there is no minimum cash compo- nent. the merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free transac- tion to general re, national re, sub and the stockholders of national re, except to the extent such stockholders receive cash in the merger. the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (i) approval of the merger by national re's stockholders, (ii) receipt of all required governmental approv- als, (iii) absence of any statute or injunction which would have an adverse effect on the consummation of the merger, (iv) decla- ration of effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the shares of general re common stock issuable in the merger, (v) absence of any change that would have a material adverse effect on any of general re, national re or sub, (vi) receipt by each of general re and national re of tax opinions from their respective tax counsel, and (vii) approval for listing on the nyse of the shares of general re common stock issuable in the merger. in connection with the merger, on july 1, 1996, general re and sub entered into stockholders' agreements (each, a "stockholder's agreement") with the following major stockholders (each, a "major stockholder") who own in the aggregate approxi- mately 22.76% of the issued and outstanding shares of national re common stock: acadia partners, l.p., keystone, inc., robert w. eager, jr., peter a. cheney, william d. warren and timothy t. mccaffrey. each of the individual major stockholders named in the preceding sentence are executive officers of national re. pursuant to the stockholders' agreements, each major stockholder agreed, among other things, to (i) vote all of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock (a) in favor of the merger and the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, provided that no such obligation will exist if national re's board of directors withdraws its recommendation that stockholders of national re vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and (b) against (1) approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, business combination, share exchange, reorganization or recapi- talization of national re or any of its subsidiaries, with or involving any party other than general re or sub, (3) any liqui- dation or winding up of national re, (4) any extraordinary dividend by national re, (5) any change in the capital structure of national re (other than pursuant to the merger agreement) and (6) any other action that may reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or result in a breach of any of the covenants, repre- sentations, warranties or other obligations or agreements of national re under the merger agreement which would materially and adversely affect national re or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (ii) not sell or transfer any of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock prior to the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. from and after july 1, 1996, each of the major stockholders has also agreed (i) not to commit any act that could restrict or otherwise affect such stockholder's full legal power, authority and right to vote such stockholder's shares of national re common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agree- ment and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, not to enter into any voting agreement with any person or entity with respect to any of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock, grant any person or entity any proxy (revocable or irrevo- cable) or power of attorney with respect to any of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock, deposit any of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock into a voting trust or otherwise enter into any agreement or arrangement limiting or affecting such major stockholder's legal power, authority or right to vote such stockholder's shares of national re common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. for a period ending on the later of december 31, 1996 or three months following the termination of the merger agreement (other than as a result of a breach by general re or sub of any stockholder's agreement or the merger agreement), each of the major stockholders has further agreed not to enter into, execute, or be a party to any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, with any person whereby such stockholder (i) grants or otherwise gives to such person an option or right to purchase or acquire any or all of such stockholder's shares of national re common stock other than sales made in open market transactions, (ii) agrees or covenants to vote or to grant a proxy to vote any or all of the shares of national re common stock held of record or beneficially owned by such stockholder, at any meeting (wheth- er annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of national re common stock, however called, or in connection with any written consent of the holders of national re common stock, or (iii) agrees or covenants to tender any or all of the national re common stock held of record or beneficially owned by such stockholder into any tender offer or exchange offer relating to national re common stock; provided that such stockholder is not prevented from granting a revocable proxy or executing a revocable written consent or tendering shares of national re common stock into any tender offer or exchange offer (the foregoing collectively, the "share restric- tions"). if, in lieu of national re's special meeting of stockholders held to approve the merger and the merger agreement (the "special meeting"), stockholder action in respect of the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby is taken by written consent, each of the major stockholders has agreed that the provisions of the stockholders' agreements imposing obliga- tions in respect of or in connection with the special meeting will similarly apply to such action by written consent. if, after the date of the stockholders' agreements, a major stockholder acquires the right to vote any additional shares of national re common stock (any such shares, "additional shares"), including, without limitation, upon exercise of any option, warrant, or other right to acquire shares of national re common stock or through any stock dividend or stock split, each of the major stockholders has agreed that the provisions described above will also apply to such additional shares. the provisions of the stockholders' agreements will termi- nate on the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the merger or (ii) the termination of the merger agreement; provided, however, that the share restrictions discussed above will expire on the later of december 31, 1996 or three months following the termination of the merger agreement (other than as a result of a breach by general re or sub of any stockholder's agreement or the merger agreement). copies of the stockholders' agreements are filed as exhibits 2 through 7 and are incorporated herein by reference. except as set forth in this item 4, the stockholders' agreements and the merger agreement, none of the reporting persons has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) - (b) pursuant to the stockholders' agreements, under the circumstances set forth therein, the reporting persons may be deemed to have shared voting power with the major stockholders. the major stockholders beneficially own in the aggregate 3,781,482 shares of national re common stock, constituting approximately 22.76% of the 16,616,894 shares of national re common stock that were issued and outstanding as of june 28, 1996. as a result of the limited voting arrangements provided for in the stockholders' agreements, the reporting persons disclaim beneficial ownership of any shares of national re common stock. (c) except as set forth in item 4, none of the reporting persons has effected any transactions in shares of national re common stock during the past 60 days.

agreed to vote the shares of common stock, with no par value, of the company (the "company common stock" or "shares") then owned by such stockholders in favor of the merger (as herein defined) provided for herein; whereas, the board of directors of the company has approved the transactions contemplated by this agree- ment and the stockholder agreements in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl") and has resolved to recom- mend the approval of the merger by the holders of shares of company common stock; and whereas, for united states federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger provided for herein shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); now, therefore, in consideration of the forego- ing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the stockholder agreements, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i the merger section 1.1 the merger. (a) subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement and in accordance with the dgcl, at the effective time (as herein defined), the company and sub shall consummate a merger (the "merg- er") pursuant to which (i) the company shall be merged with and into sub and the separate corporate existence of the company shall thereupon cease, and (ii) sub shall be the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") in the merger and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the state of delaware. pursuant to the merger, (x) the certificate of incorporation of sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of incorporation, and (y) the by-laws of sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, shall be the by-laws of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation and such by- laws. the merger shall have the effects set forth in the dgcl. section 1.2 effective time. parent, sub and the company will cause a certificate of merger (the "certificate of merger") with respect to the merger to be executed and filed on the date of the closing (as defined in section 1.3) (or on such other date as parent and the company may agree) with the secretary of state of the state of delaware as provided in the dgcl. the merger shall become effective on the date on which the certifi- cate of merger has been duly filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware or such time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger, and such time is hereinafter referred to as the "effective time". section 1.3 closing. the closing of the merger (the "closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., new york city time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than two new york stock exchange ("nyse") trading days after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in article vi hereof (the "closing date"), at the offices of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom, 919 third avenue, new york, new york, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writ- ing by the parties hereto. section 1.4 directors and officers of the surviving corporation. the directors and officers of sub at the effective time shall, from and after the effective time, be the initial directors and officers, respective- ly, of the surviving corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation and by-laws. section 1.5 stockholders' meeting. in order to consummate the merger, the company, acting through its board of directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the "company special meet- ing"), as soon as practicable after the registration statement on form s-4 (together with all amendments, schedules, and exhibits thereto) to be filed by parent in connection with the registration of the shares of common stock, $.50 par value, of parent ("parent common stock") and the associated preferred stock purchase rights of parent (the "parent rights") to be issued by parent in the merger (the "registration statement") is declared effective, for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this agreement. (unless the context other- wise requires, all references in this agreement to parent common stock shall include the corresponding parent rights.) the company shall include in the joint proxy statement/prospectus forming a part of the registration statement (the "proxy statement/prospectus") the recom- mendation of the board of directors of the company that stockholders of the company vote in favor of the approval of the merger and the adoption of this agreement; provid- ed that the company may withdraw, modify or change such recommendation only to the extent that the board of directors of the company determines, after having re- ceived the advice of outside legal counsel to the company and the advice of the company's financial advisor, that the failure to withdraw, modify or change such recommen- dation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law. article ii conversion of shares; election procedures section 2.1 conversion of shares. (a) each share of company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to section 2.1(c) hereof and dissenting shares (as herein defined)) shall, at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this article ii, either (a) a fraction (the "conver- sion fraction") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of parent common stock, determined by dividing $53 by the average (without rounding) of the closing prices per share of parent common stock on the nyse as reported on the nyse composite tape for the ten (10) consecutive nyse trading days ending on the second nyse trading day immediately preceding the closing date (the "average parent share price") and rounding the result to the nearest one one-hundred thousandth of a share; provided, that parent shall issue not more than .39259 nor less than .32121 shares of parent common stock per share (the "stock consideration") or (b) $53 in cash, without any interest thereon (the "cash consideration"). (b) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the surviving corporation. (c) all shares of company common stock that are owned by the company as treasury stock and any shares of company common stock owned by parent, sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary (as defined in section 3.1 hereof) of parent shall, at the effective time, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no parent common stock or cash consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. (d) on and after the effective time, holders of certificates which immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares (the "cer- tificates") shall cease to have any rights as stockhold- ers of the company, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this article ii (the "merger consideration") for each share held by them. section 2.2 election procedure. each holder of shares (other than holders of shares to be cancelled as set forth in section 2.1(c) and dissenting shares) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this article ii, to submit a request specifying the number of shares that such holder desires to have converted into the stock consideration in the merger and the number of shares that such holder desires to have converted into the cash consideration in the merger in accordance with the following procedures: (a) each holder of shares may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this section 2.2 (herein called an "election") (i) the number of shares owned by such holder that such holder desires to have converted into the right to receive the stock consideration in the merger (a "stock election") and (ii) the number of shares owned by such holder that such holder desires to have converted into the right to re- ceive the cash consideration in the merger (a "cash election"). (b) parent shall prepare a form reason- ably acceptable to the company (the "form of election") which shall be mailed to the company's stockholders entitled to vote at the company special meeting so as to permit the company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an election prior to the election deadline (as defined in section 2.2(d)). (c) parent shall use all reasonable efforts to make the form of election initially available to all stockholders of the company at least twenty busi- ness days prior to the election deadline and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available on a prompt basis a form of election to any stockholder of the compa- ny who requests such form following the initial mailing of the forms of election and prior to the election dead- line. (d) any election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive elec- tions and to act as exchange agent under this agreement, which person shall be designated by parent and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the company (the "exchange agent"), shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such exchange agent is located, on the date of the election deadline, a form of election properly completed and signed and accom- panied by certificates for the shares to which such form of election relates (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such form of election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or of the national association of securities dealers, inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the united states provided such certificates are in fact delivered to the exchange agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery). failure to deliver shares covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made elec- tion. as used herein, "election deadline" means the date mutually agreed to by parent and company, in a news release delivered to the dow jones news service, as the last day on which forms of election will be accepted; provided, that such date shall be a business day no earlier than twenty business days prior to the effective time and no later than the date on which the effective time occurs and shall be at least ten business days following the date of such news release and, unless the company and parent otherwise agree, shall not precede the date of the company special meeting; provided, further, that parent shall have the right to set a later date of, or to extend, the election deadline so long as such later date is no later than the date on which the effective time occurs. (e) any company stockholder may at any time prior to the election deadline change his or her election by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised form of election. (f) any company stockholder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, revoke his or her election by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of his or her certificates for shares, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certifi- cates, previously deposited with the exchange agent. all elections shall be revoked automatically if the exchange agent is notified in writing by parent or the company that this agreement has been terminated. any company stockholder who shall have deposited certificates for shares with the exchange agent shall have the right to withdraw such certificates by written notice received by the exchange agent and thereby revoke his election as of the election deadline if the merger shall not have been consummated prior thereto. (g) parent shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement, governing the validity of the forms of election, the manner and extent to which elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by sec- tion 2.3, the issuance and delivery of certificates for parent common stock into which shares are converted in the merger and the payment of cash for shares converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in the merger. section 2.3 issuance of parent common stock and payment of cash consideration; proration. the manner in which each share (other than shares to be cancelled as set forth in section 2.1(c) and dissenting shares) shall be converted into the right to receive either the stock consideration or the cash consideration on the effective date shall be as set forth in this section 2.3. all references to "outstanding" shares in this section 2.3 shall mean (i) all shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time minus (ii) shares owned by parent or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. (a) in the event that, between the date of this agreement and the effective time, the issued and outstanding shares of parent common stock shall have been affected or changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, extraordi- nary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar transaction with a record date within such period, the conversion fraction shall be appropriately adjusted. (b) as is more fully set forth below, the total cash consideration in the merger pursuant to this agreement shall not be more than 50% of the value of all outstanding shares. "total cash consideration" shall mean the sum of (1) the fair market value of shares to be converted into the right to receive the cash consider- ation, (2) cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, and (3) cash paid for dissenting shares. for these purposes, cash paid for dissenting shares shall be computed as if holders of dissenting shares had made the cash election. (c) each share for which a stock election has been received and each share as to which an election is not in effect at the election deadline (a "non-elect- ing share") shall be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration in the merger. (d) if the total cash consideration is 50% or less of the value of the outstanding shares, each share covered by a cash election shall be converted in the merger into the right to receive the cash consider- ation. (e) if the total cash consideration is more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares, the shares for which cash elections have been received shall be converted into the right to receive the cash consider- ation and the stock consideration in the following man- ner: (1) the exchange agent will distrib- ute with respect to shares as to which a cash election has been made the cash consideration with respect to a fraction of such shares, the numerator of which fraction shall be 50% of the value (based on the clos- ing price of the shares on the last full trading day prior to the effec- tive time) of the outstanding shares and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (a) the value (based on the closing price of the shares on the last full trading day prior to the effective time) of the aggregate number of shares covered by cash elections, (b) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares and (c) cash to be paid for dissenting shares (computed as if holders of dissenting shares had made the cash election) and (2) shares covered by a cash elec- tion and not fully converted into the right to receive the cash consider- ation as set forth in clause (1) above shall be converted in the merg- er into the right to receive the stock consideration. (f) if parent and the company shall determine that any election is not properly made with respect to any shares, such election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares covered by such election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be non-electing shares. (g) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of parent common stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to shares shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stock- holder of parent. in lieu of any such fractional share of parent common stock, parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the company who otherwise would be enti- tled to receive a fractional share of parent common stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average parent share price but not more than $165.00 nor less than $135.00 by (ii) the fractional interest in a share of parent common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. section 2.4 issuance of parent common stock. immediately following the effective time, parent shall deliver, in trust, to the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares, certificates representing an aggregate number of shares of parent common stock as nearly as practicable equal to the product of the conver- sion fraction and the number of shares to be converted into parent common stock as determined in section 2.3. as soon as practicable after the effective time, each holder of shares converted into parent common stock in the merger, upon surrender to the exchange agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a form of elec- tion) of one or more certificates for such shares for cancellation, shall be entitled to receive certificates representing the number of shares of parent common stock into which such shares shall have been converted in the merger. no dividends or distributions that have been declared will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates for shares of parent common stock until such persons surrender their certificates for shares, at which time all such dividends shall be paid. in no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be enti- tled to receive interest on such dividends. if any certificate for such parent common stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate for shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes (as herein defined) required by reason of issuance of certificates for such parent common stock in a name other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the exchange agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares for any parent common stock or dividends thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. section 2.5 payment of cash consideration. at the closing, parent shall deposit in trust with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares, an amount in cash equal to the cash consideration multi- plied by the number of shares to be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration as determined in section 2.3. as soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall distribute to holders of shares converted into the right to receive the cash consideration, upon surrender to the exchange agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a form of election) of one or more certificates for such shares for cancellation, a bank check for an amount equal to the cash consideration times the number of shares so convert- ed. in no event shall the holder of any such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any of the cash consideration to be received in the merger. if such check is to be issued in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the certificates for the shares surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issu- ance of such check to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates surrendered, or shall estab- lish to the reasonable satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. not- withstanding the foregoing, neither the exchange agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. section 2.6 treatment of company stock op- tions. (a) each option granted to a company employee to acquire shares of company common stock ("company stock option") that is outstanding on the effective time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, effec- tive as of the effective time, become and represent an option for the number of shares of parent common stock (a "substitute option"), rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of company common stock subject to such company stock option immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the conversion fraction at an exercise price per share of parent common stock (decreased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of such company stock option divided by the conversion fraction; provid- ed, however, that in the case of any company stock option to which section 421 of the code applies by reason of its qualification as an incentive stock option under section 422 of the code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted if necessary to comply with section 424(a) of the code. after the effective time, except as provided above in this section 2.6, each substitute option shall be exer- cisable upon the same terms and conditions as were appli- cable to the related company stock option immediately prior to the effective time. notwithstanding the forego- ing provisions of this section 2.6(a) or any other provi- sion of this agreement, the company and the holder of any company stock option may amend such company stock option so that the holder of such company stock option (if it is outstanding at the effective time) may elect to receive, in settlement thereof, an amount in cash equal to the excess of $53 over the exercise price of such company stock option multiplied by the number of shares subject to such company stock option. (b) prior to the effective time, the company shall use all reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any consents from holders of company stock options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, in each case as is necessary to give effect to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 2.6. (c) prior to the effective time, parent shall (i) file with the securities and exchange commis- sion ("sec") a registration statement on form s-8 or another appropriate form for the registration of shares of parent common stock issuable pursuant to all substi- tute options and (ii) amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, in each case as is necessary to give effect to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 2.6. section 2.7 stock transfer books. at the effective time, the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed and there shall be no further registra- tion of transfers of shares on the records of the compa- ny. if, after the effective time, certificates repre- senting shares are presented to the surviving corpora- tion, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash and/or certificates representing parent common stock pursuant to this article ii. section 2.8 shares of dissenting stockholders. notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the con- trary, any shares of company common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the effective time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights (the "dissenting shares") under the dgcl shall not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively with- drawn or lost, his right to dissent from the merger under the dgcl and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the dgcl. if any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holder's company common stock shall there- upon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the effective time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the stock consideration or the cash consideration or a combination thereof as deter- mined by parent in its sole discretion. the company shall give parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of company common stock received by the company and (ii) the oppor- tunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. the company shall not, without the prior written consent of parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. section 2.9 tax opinion adjustment. subject to the limitation of, and the proviso of section 2.1(a), if either (i) the tax opinion referred to in section 6.3(e) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by nationally recognized tax counsel to the company) or (ii) the tax opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to parent referred to section 6.2(d) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by nationally recognized tax coun- sel to parent), in either case as a result of the merger potentially failing to satisfy continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax princi- ples relating to reorganizations under section 368(a) of the code, then parent shall reduce the cash consideration to the minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case may be, to be ren- dered, and correspondingly increase the stock consider- ation. article iii representations and warranties of the company the company represents and warrants to parent and sub as follows: section 3.1 organization. each of the company and its subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incor- poration or

below) on the company and its subsid- iaries taken as a whole. each of the company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed

effective time and (b) any material failure of the company or parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be com- plied with or satisfied by it

(6) years after consummation of the merger the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the company and its subsidiaries on the date hereof (provided that parent may substitute therefor policies having at least the same coverage and containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons currently covered by such policies and with carriers comparable to the company's existing carriers in terms of creditworthi- ness) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the assertion (an "assertion") of any claim or the commencement of any action against him or her in respect to which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against parent, the compa- ny, the surviving corporation or a subsidiary of the company or the surviving corporation ("indemnitors") hereunder, such indemnified party shall notify any indem- nitor in writing of the assertion, but the failure to so notify any indemnitor shall not relieve any indemnitor of any liability it may have to such indemnified party hereunder except where such failure shall have materially prejudiced indemnitor in defending against such asser- tion. no indemnified party shall settle any assertion without the prior written consent of parent provided, however, that if parent withholds such consent, then parent shall provide the indemnified party reasonable assurances that it shall honor the indemnification provi- sions of this section 5.10. the provisions of this section

sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(e) of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of july , 1996, among parent, sub and the company,* hereby certifies that, to the extent the facts relate to the company, to his knowledge and after due diligence, and to the extent otherwise (including with respect to matters involving sub) without knowledge to the contrary, the descriptions of the facts contained in the proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement, dated ___________, 1996, relating to the proposed merger of the company into sub completely and accurately describe the merger and the transactions leading up thereto and further that: 1. the merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, and none of the material terms and conditions therein have been or, except as scheduled, will have been, waived or modified. 2. the fair market value of the parent common stock and cash consideration received by each company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the company common stock surrendered in the exchange and was arrived at through arm's length negotiation. 3. there is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between parent and the company or between sub and the company that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount. 4. the company is not an investment company as defined in section 368(a)(2)(f)(iii) and (iv) of the internal revenue code. * for purposes of this certificate, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the agreement and plan of merger. 5. at the effective time, sub will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the company immediately prior to the merger. for purposes of this representation, amounts used by the company to pay its reorganization expenses and dissenters and to make all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by the company immediately preceding the transfer will be included as assets of the company held immediately prior to the merger. 6. following the merger, sub will continue the historic business of the company or use a significant portion of the company's business assets in a business. 7. the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. 8. none of the compensation received (or to be received) by any shareholder-employee of the company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of his shares of company common stock. none of the parent common stock received by any shareholder-employee of the company pursuant to the merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement or arrangement. the compensation paid to any shareholder-employee of the company will be commensurate with amounts that would be paid to a third party bargaining at arm's length for similar services. 9. the company, the parent,sub and the shareholders of the company will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the merger and the transactions related thereto. 10. on the date hereof, there is no plan or intention on the part of the shareholders of the company who own 5 percent or more of the common stock of the company and, to the best knowledge of the management of the company, there is no plan or intention on the part of the remaining shareholders of the company, to sell, exchange or dispose otherwise of a number of shares of parent common stock received in the merger that would reduce such company shareholders' ownership of parent common stock to a number of shares having a value, as of the date of the merger, of less than 50 percent of the value of all of the formerly outstanding company common stock as of the same date. for purposes of this representation, shares of company common stock exchanged for cash or other property in the merger, surrendered by dissenters or exchanged for cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock will be treated as outstanding company common stock on the date of the merger. in addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing, the company has considered, in making this representation, any shares of company common stock that have been sold, redeemed or otherwise disposed of by shareholders who own 5 percent or more of the company common stock, or by shareholders who are officers or directors of the company, after the announcement of the merger and prior to the effective time, to the extent the management of the company has knowledge on the date hereof of any such sales, redemptions or dispositions. except as set forth on annex i to this letter, to the knowledge of the management of the company, there are no shareholders who own 5 percent or more of the company common stock on the date hereof. 11. the liabilities of the company assumed by sub and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the company are subject were incurred by the company in the ordinary course of its business. 12. the fair market value of the assets of the company transferred to sub will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject. 13. the company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(a) of the internal revenue code. i understand that paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton & garrison, as counsel for the company, and skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom, as counsel for parent and sub, will rely on this certificate in rendering their respective opinions concerning certain of the federal income tax consequences of the merger and hereby commit to inform them if, for any reason, any of the foregoing representations ceases to be true prior to the effective time. national re corporation

("sub") and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of parent and the undersigned shareholder (the "shareholder") of national re corporation, a delaware corporation ("company"), hereby enter into this agreement on july 1, 1996 for the purposes hereinafter set forth (parent, sub and the shareholder are collectively referred to as the "parties"). whereas, parent, sub and company entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated as of july 1, 1996 (the "merger agreement"); whereas, pursuant to the merger agreement, company will merge (the "merger") with and into sub and pursuant to such merger, each shareholder will surrender all of its shares of common stock of company ("company common stock") in exchange for cash and shares of common stock of parent ("parent common shares"); whereas, the parties wish to take certain steps to qualify the merger as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986 (the "code"); now, therefore, the parties agree as follows: 1. the shareholder represents that the shareholder has not purchased, sold, exchanged, transferred by gift or otherwise disposed of shares of company common stock prior to the date hereof either in contemplation of or as part of the merger or otherwise. 2. the shareholder represents that the shareholder does not have any plan or intention to sell, exchange, transfer by gift or otherwise dispose (including by transactions which would have the ultimate economic effect of a disposition including, but not limited to, puts, short-sales and equity swap type of arrangement) (collectively, "dispose" or "disposition") any parent common shares to be received by such shareholder pursuant to the merger. 3. the shareholder further agrees that for a period of eighteen months after the merger (the "post-merger continuity period"), the shareholder will not sell, exchange, transfer by gift or otherwise dispose of any of the parent common shares that the shareholder receives in exchange for company common stock pursuant to the merger; provided, however, the shareholder (or the estate of the shareholder) is expressly permitted to transfer the parent common shares pursuant to a pledge that is not a disposition, upon the shareholder's death or to a "grantor" trust created for the shareholder's benefit in which the shareholder is treated as the owner pursuant to sections 671 through 678 of the code and, if the shareholder is a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the shareholder is expressly permitted to transfer its parent common shares to its partners pro rata in accordance with their interests in the shareholder on the condition that, prior to any such transfer of parent common shares, each partner that would have owned (or would have been treated as owning) 5% of company common stock at the time of the merger (if the shareholder had distributed its company common stock pro rata to its partners in accordance with their interests in the shareholder at such time) executes a continuity of interest agreement (i) identical to this agreement or (ii) substantially similar to this agreement and reasonably acceptable to skadden arps or other tax counsel. notwithstanding this paragraph 3, the shareholder may, prior to the end of the post-merger continuity period, sell, exchange, transfer by gift or otherwise dispose of parent common shares that the shareholder receives pursuant to the merger, if, prior to the date of such disposition, the shareholder (i) obtains the written consent of skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom ("skadden arps") and paul, weiss, wharton, rifkind and garrison or (ii) obtains a written opinion of cleary, gottlieb, steen & hamilton or another nationally recognized tax counsel experienced in tax-free corporate reorganizations ("other tax counsel") (which opinion will specifically set forth the facts and analysis forming the basis of such opinion), that such disposition will not prevent such parent common shares from qualifying as stock that satisfies the "continuity of interest" requirement under section 368 of the code. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the stock consideration (excluding cash in lieu of fractional shares) issued in the merger is issued in exchange for more than 50% of the shares of company common stock, the shareholder may dispose of a number of shares of parent common stock that bears the same relationship to the number of shares of parent common stock issued in excess of 50% of the shares of company common stock that (i) the number of shares of parent common stock held by the shareholder bears to (ii) the number of shares of parent common stock held by all shareholders who execute continuity of interest agreements substantially similar to this agreement. 4. the shareholder agrees that, during the post- merger continuity period, the shareholder will give notice to parent at least 30 days prior to any proposed disposition of parent common shares received pursuant to the merger, which notice shall describe (i) the number of parent common shares that will be subject to the proposed disposition, and (ii) the manner of such disposition. 5. this agreement shall be binding upon and shall be enforceable against the successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 6. this agreement shall not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except by a written agreement executed by all of the parties hereto. 7. all notices to parent should be sent to: general re corporation 695 east main street stamford, ct 06904 8. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 9. capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as in the merger agreement. in witness whereof, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to be duly executed on the date first set forth above. general re corporation by: name: title: n acquisition
