as set forth in the certificate of designations of the preferred stock, at any time, the holder of the preferred stock may elect to convert shares of the preferred stock, in whole or in part, at an initial conversion rate of 62.5 shares of common stock per share of preferred stock (initially, an aggregate of 31.25 million shares of the issuer&#8217;s common stock), or an initial conversion price of $16.00 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and make-whole adjustment upon certain fundamental changes. &#160; the holder of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the issuer&#8217;s board of directors, cumulative dividends at the rate of 5&#190;% per annum, payable quarterly in cash.&#160;&#160;accumulated but unpaid dividends accumulate at the rate of 5&#190;% per annum.&#160;&#160;each share of preferred stock will have a liquidation preference of $1,000 plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not declared) accumulated and unpaid to the date of final distribution to holders.&#160;&#160;the preferred stock will rank senior to the issuer&#8217;s common stock and on parity with the issuer&#8217;s outstanding series of preferred stock. &#160; the preferred stock will be governed by the terms of the certificate of designations of the preferred stock.&#160;&#160;except as granted under delaware law or the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation, the preferred stock will have no voting rights, other than with respect to adverse amendments to the issuer&#8217;s organizational documents or the certificate of designations for the preferred stock, including the creation of, or increase in the authorized amount of, any equity securities, which will be senior to the preferred stock.&#160;&#160;in addition, if dividends are in arrears for six calendar quarters (whether or not consecutive) or if the redemption price is not timely paid, then the holders of the preferred stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of parity stock with like voting rights that are then exercisable) will be entitled to elect two additional directors at the issuer&#8217;s next annual or special meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until all accumulated and unpaid dividends or the redemption price, as applicable, have been fully paid or set apart for payment. the term of office of such directors shall terminate immediately upon the termination of the right of the holders of the preferred stock and parity stock to vote for such directors. &#160; the issuer may not redeem any shares of the preferred stock before three years after the date of issuance of the preferred stock. on or after three years after the date of issuance of the preferred stock, the issuer may redeem some or all of the preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends to the redemption date, but only if the closing sale price of the issuer&#8217;s common stock for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date the issuer gives the redemption notice exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the preferred stock. &#160; registration rights agreement &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; upon closing of the issuance on december 30, 2010, the issuer and fcx entered into a registration rights agreement (the &#8220;registration rights agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which the issuer has agreed to, within 60 days of closing, (1) prepare and file with the sec a shelf registration statement with respect to the preferred stock issued to fcx preferred under the stock purchase agreement and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock (the &#8220;registrable securities&#8221;) that would permit the registrable securities to be resold in registered transactions and (2) use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement while fcx and its affiliates hold registrable securities. in addition, under certain circumstances, the registration rights agree ment permits fcx preferred to demand or participate in an underwritten public offering of common stock by the issuer. &#160; stockholder agreement &#160; upon closing of the issuance on december 30, 2010, fcx, fcx preferred and the issuer entered into a stockholder agreement (the &#8220;stockholder agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things, fcx will have the right to nominate individuals to serve on the issuer&#8217;s board of directors (the &#8220;designated directors&#8221;) under the stockholder agreement, for as long as fcx and its affiliates beneficially own (1) not less than 75% of the percentage of the issuer&#8217;s common stock on a fully diluted basis owned at closing by fcx and its affiliates, fcx will have the right to designate two members of the issuer&#8217;s board of directors;
