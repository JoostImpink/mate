technology limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of the british virgin islands ("bonson"), and lenovo it alliance limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of the british virgin islands ("lial"). this forward contract is the forward contract referred to in, and is subject to all of the terms and conditions of, the acquisition agreement dated july 27, 2004 (the "acquisition agreement") by and between asiainfo holdings, inc., a corporation organized and existing under the law of the state of delaware of the united states ("purchaser"), and lenovo group limited, a company organized and existing under the law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people's republic of china ("seller"), as supplemented and amended by supplement and amendment no. 1 to acquisition agreement (the "supplement") dated october 1, 2004 by and between purchaser and seller. the acquisition agreement, as supplemented and amended by the supplement, is referred to herein as the "amended acquisition agreement". capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the amended acquisition agreement. in the event of any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of the amended acquisition agreement, the relevant provisions of the amended acquisition agreement shall prevail. bonson and lial have agreed to enter into this forward contract to provide for the forward payment of part of the purchase price for the assets in the amount of rmb260,000,000 (the "settlement amount"), as contemplated in section 2.5(a) of the amended acquisition agreement. bonson and lial agree that the settlement amount shall be satisfied through the transfer by bonson to lial, at any time during the 12-month period following the closing date, as determined by bonson at its sole and absolute discretion (the "settlement date"), of an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of purchaser (the "forward contract shares") having a market value equivalent to the settlement amount as calculated in accordance with section 2.11 of the amended acquisition agreement, subject to any adjustment as provided in sections 2.10(f), 2.11(c) or elsewhere in the amended acquisition agreement, and further subject to the asiainfo share cap as provided in section 2.11 of the amended acquisition agreement. in the event that the settlement amount is greater than the market value of the maximum number of forward contract shares available under the asiainfo share cap, the difference shall be paid by purchaser or bonson (at purchaser's option) to seller, in cash or in asiainfo shares having an aggregate market value on the settlement date equal to such difference, or in any combination of cash and asiainfo shares, at the sole and absolute discretion of purchaser. lial acknowledges and agrees that the forward contract shares that are escrow shares shall be delivered to the escrow agent pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement and that the release of such shares to lial shall be subject to the terms thereof. on the settlement date, bonson shall transfer asiainfo shares that it holds free and clear of encumbrances (other than permitted encumbrances or encumbrances arising by virtue of applicable securities laws) to lial or the escrow agent, as the case may be, in order to fulfil its obligation to deliver the forward contract shares under this forward contract. as soon as possible after the settlement date (but in any event within five business days), bonson shall deliver (i) to lial a certificate or certificates representing the number of forward contract shares that are not escrow shares and (ii) to the escrow agent a certificate or certificates representing the number of forward contract shares that are escrow shares, in each case, duly endorsed for transfer in blank or in the name of lial. the transfer of the forward contract shares shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the settlement date. bonson shall give written notice of such delivery to lial no later than 2:00 p.m. on the settlement date. such notice shall include the number of asiainfo shares to be transferred and shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions in section 9.1 of the amended acquisition agreement. this forward contract shall not entitle lial to any rights as a shareholder of purchaser or to any other rights except the rights stated herein. at such time as such delivery has been effected, the rights of lial under this forward contract shall cease, and lial shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the forward contract shares. the delivery of certificates for the forward contract shares shall be made without charge to lial for transfer tax (if any) in respect thereof or other cost incurred by bonson in connection with the delivery of the forward contract shares under this forward contract. on or prior to the settlement date, bonson shall take all such actions as are necessary in order to ensure that the forward contract shares deliverable under this forward contract shall be validly issued by purchaser, fully paid and nonassessable, and held by bonson, free and clear of all encumbrances (other than permitted encumbrances or encumbrances arising by virtue of applicable securities laws), and shall rank pari passu with all other asiainfo shares. bonson hereby represents and warrants to seller that, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the seller in section 3.30 of the amended acquisition agreement, the transfer of the asiainfo shares to lial on the settlement date will not require registration under the securities act. lial acknowledges and agrees that, except as contemplated in section 2.11(b) of the amended acquisition agreement, in no event shall it be entitled to receive cash or other assets, other than the forward contract shares, in respect of bonson's obligation to deliver the settlement amount and that such obligation shall be fully satisfied by prompt delivery (and in any event within five business days following the settlement date) of (i) the certificate or certificates representing the number of forward contract shares that are not escrow shares to lial and (ii) the certificate or certificates representing the number of forward contract shares that are escrow shares to the escrow agent. lial acknowledges that the foregoing agreement is an essential element of this forward contract, absent which purchaser would not have entered into the transactions contemplated in the amended acquisition agreement and hereby. each of the parties agrees that (i) for all united states federal, state and local tax purposes, this forward contract in its entirety shall be treated as a forward contract for the delivery of the forward contract shares and will be not be treated in whole or any portion thereof, as constituting indebtedness or giving rise to any amount of interest or other ordinary expense to lial and (ii) this forward contract is not intended to be governed by the provisions of the united states commodity exchange act of 1936, as amended, or by the rules or regulations of the united states commodity futures

remedy at law or in equity. this forward contract constitutes a "securities contract" within the meaning of section 741(7) of title 11 of the united states code as amended (the "bankruptcy code"), and as such each party shall be entitled to the rights and benefits afforded to such securities contract under the bankruptcy code. this forward contract shall not be assigned or transferred by either
