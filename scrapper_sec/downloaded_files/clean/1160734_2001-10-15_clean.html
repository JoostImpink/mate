(d) notify each holder of registrable securities covered by such shelf registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, and then use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct such statement or omission. notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary set forth in this section 7.3, each holder acknowledges that the company shall have the right to suspend the use of the prospectus forming a part of a shelf registration statement if such offering would interfere with a pending corporate transaction or for other reasons until such time as an amendment to the shelf registration statement has been filed by the company and declared effective by the sec, or until such time as the company has filed an appropriate report with the sec pursuant to the exchange act. each holder hereby covenants that it will (a) keep any such notice strictly confidential, and (b) not sell any shares of common stock pursuant to such prospectus during the period commencing at the time at which the company gives the holder notice of the suspension of the use of such prospectus and ending at the time the company gives the holder notice that it may thereafter effect sales pursuant to such prospectus. the company shall only be able to suspend the use of such prospectus for periods aggregating no more than 90 days with respect to any one pending corporate transaction or other reason for suspension without the written consent of the investor. 7.4 furnish information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this article vii with respect to the registrable securities of any selling holder that such holder shall furnish to the company such information regarding itself, the registrable securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of such holder's registrable securities and as may be required from time to time to keep such registration current. 18 7.5 expenses of shelf registration. except as provided in the following sentence, all expenses incurred by or on behalf of the company in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to section 7.2, including, without limitation, all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, shall be borne by the company. in no event shall the company be obligated to bear any underwriting discounts or commissions or brokerage fees or commissions relating to registrable securities or the fees and expenses of counsel to the selling holders. 7.6 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a shelf registration statement under this article vii: (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, general and limited partners, members, agents and representatives (and the directors, officers, affiliates and controlling persons thereof), and each other person, if any, who controls such holder within the meaning of the act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus (but only if such statement is not corrected in the final prospectus) contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (but only if such omission is not corrected in the final prospectus), or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company in connection with the registration of registrable securities under the act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the act, the exchange act or any state securities law; and the company will pay to each such holder, affiliate or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses of a single counsel (and any necessary local counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, subject to this section 7.6(a); provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 7.6(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder or controlling person. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any 19 violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this section 7.6(b) in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 7.6(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this section 7.6(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7.6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 7.6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party subject to the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 7.6 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 7.6. the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of any action referred to above through counsel of its own choosing and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all separate defenses, cross claims or counterclaims which it may have, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in advance by the indemnifying party, (ii) there is a conflict of interest that prevents counsel for the indemnifying party from adequately representing the interests of the indemnified party or there are defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from, or additional to, the defenses that are available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party does not employ counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time, or (iv) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense or does not reasonably contest such action in good faith, in which case, if the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party that it elects to employ separate counsel, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party and the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one firm acting as local counsel) for all indemnified parties. (d) the obligations of the company and the holders under this section 7.6 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a shelf registration statement under this article vii through the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. (e) notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement (if any) entered into in 20 connection with any underwritten public offering of the registrable securities are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall control. 7.7 reports under the exchange act. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) use all commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144; (b) use all commercially reasonable efforts to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required under the act and the exchange act; and (c) furnish to any holder forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company and such other reports and documents so filed by the company. 7.8 no assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities pursuant to this article vii may only be assigned by a holder to a transferee or assignee of any registrable securities if (i) such transferee or assignee is a member of the investor group, (ii) such transferee executes and delivers to the company a joinder agreement, agreeing to be legally bound by this article vii, and (iii) immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the act. 7.9 waiver procedures. the observance by the company of any provision of this article vii may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with the written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities, and any waiver effected in accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon each holder of registrable securities. 7.10 "market stand-off" agreement. any holder of registrable securities, if requested by an underwriter of any registered public offering of company securities being sold in a firm commitment underwriting, agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any common stock (or other company voting securities) held by such holder other than shares of registrable securities included in the registration during the seven days prior to, and during a period of up to 180 days following, the effective date of the registration statement, except where securities being sold for the account of stockholders are included in the registration unless all registrable securities requested to be included therein by any holders are included subject to pro rata cut-back with the other selling stockholders included therein. such agreement shall be in writing in a form reasonably satisfactory to the company and such underwriter. the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of the required stand-off period. 7.11 listing of shares. the company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the conversion shares and (ii) upon exercise of the warrant, the warrant shares, to be listed on the american stock exchange as soon as practicable after the closing. 21 article viii definitions "affiliate" shall mean, with respect to any person, any other person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control with such first person. as used in this definition, "control" (including, with correlative meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies, whether through the ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise.
