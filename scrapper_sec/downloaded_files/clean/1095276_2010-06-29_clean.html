second to rg llc on a pro rata basis with any stockholders of the company with registration rights at the time of such offering not included in the 1 s t category; and 3 rd , on a pro rata basis to any stockholders of the company that are not included in the first and second category. if rg llc disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, rg llc may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter, delivered at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. any shares excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. &#160;&#160; 3 &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; right to terminate registration. the company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it pursuant to this section 3 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not rg llc has elected to include shares in such registration. the registration expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the company in accordance with section 4 hereof. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; termination of piggyback registration rights. all registration rights granted under this section 3 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the 3rd anniversary of the effective date. &#160;

(b)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;subject to sections 2(c) and 5(a), use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for a period not exceeding the earlier of (i) the 3rd anniversary of the date hereof, or (ii) such time as all of the shares held by rg llc have been sold. &#160; (c)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;furnish to rg llc such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents as rg may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of shares. &#160;&#160; 4 &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160; use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by rg llc. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160;&#160; advise rg llc promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge of the issuance of any stop order by the sec delaying or suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement that includes the shares or of the initiation of any proceeding for that purpose; and it will promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order should be issued. &#160; (f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter(s) of such offering. if that rg llc participates in such underwriting, then rg llc shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement. &#160; (g) &#160;&#160;&#160; notify rg llc at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. &#160; (h)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; cause all such shares registered under such registration statement to be listed or quoted on each securities exchange on which the common stock of the company is then listed or quoted. &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, on the date that such shares are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) a letter dated as of such date, from the independent registered public accountants of the company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent registered public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering addressed to the underwriters, if any. &#160; 5 &#160; 6.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;obligations of rg llc. &#160; (a) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;in the event: (i) of any request by the sec or any other federal or state governmental authority during the period of effectiveness of a registration statement filed pursuant to sections 2 and 3 for amendments or supplements to such registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information so that such registration statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the federal securities laws; (ii) of the issuance by the sec or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iii) of the receipt by the company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; (iv) of any event or circumstance that, considering the advice of counsel, the company reasonably believes necessitates the making of any changes in such registration statement or related prospectus, or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, so that, in the case of such registration statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of a related prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (v) that the company reasonably believes, considering the advice of counsel, that the company may, in the absence of a suspension described hereunder, be required under state or federal securities laws to disclose any corporate development, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the company, its stockholders, a potentially material transaction or event involving the company, or any negotiations, discussions or proposals directly relating thereto; then the company shall deliver a written notice (a "suspension notice") to rg llc to the effect of the foregoing and, upon receipt of such suspension notice, rg llc will refrain from selling any shares pursuant to such registration statement (a "suspension" ) until rg llc receives copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus prepared and filed by the company or until rg llc is advised in writing by the company that the current prospectus may be used and rg llc has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in any such prospectus. in the event of a suspension, the company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of the prospectus so suspended to be resumed as soon as reasonably practicable after delivery of a suspension notice to rg llc. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; provided that a suspension is not then in effect, rg llc will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act as applicable to it (unless an exemption therefrom is available) in connection with sales of the shares pursuant to the registration statement and shall sell the shares only in accordance with a method of distribution described in the registration statement. &#160;

8. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; indemnification. in the event any shares are included in a registration statement pursuant to sections 2 or 3: &#160; 6 &#160; (a) &#160;&#160;&#160; to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless rg llc, the managers, members, employees and agents of rg llc, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for rg llc and each person, if any, who controls rg llc or the underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, for, from, and against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "violation" ) by the company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the company will pay as incurred to rg llc, or such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person of rg llc, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by rg llc, or such officer, director, or controlling person of rg llc. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; to the extent permitted by law, rg llc will, if the shares held by rg llc are included in the securities as to which such registration qualifications or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other stockholder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other stockholder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such stockholder, for, from, and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such stockholder, or partner, director, officer or controlling person of such other stockholder may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by rg llc under an instrument duly executed by rg llc and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and rg llc will pay as incurred any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other stockholder, or partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other stockholder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of rg llc, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this section 8 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by rg llc. &#160; 7 &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 8, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 8. &#160; (d)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by rg llc hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by rg llc. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the obligations of the company and rg llc under this section 8 shall survive completion of any offering of the shares in a registration statement and the termination of this agreement. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. &#160;
