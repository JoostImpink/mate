document definitive terms of purchase and sale reasonably and in good faith. the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, agreements and other definitive terms of purchase and sale by noble and arcelor shall be the same, as much as practicable, as the terms of purchase and sale between arcelor and the third party that sold the business or entity to arcelor, except that arcelor and noble specifically agree as follows with respect to purchase price. the price payable by noble to arcelor for the laser-welded blank production part of the business or entity shall be that price which is agreed upon by the parties after conducting negotiations reasonably and in good faith. if no agreement on price is reached despite reasonable, good-faith negotiations, then the price shall be determined by an appraiser. the appraiser shall be an internationally recognized investment banking or accounting firm selected jointly by noble and arcelor. the appraiser shall determine the purchase price based on the appraiser&#146;s assessment of the fair market value of portion of the business or entity that is the subject of the transaction, viewed on a standalone basis without consideration of synergies or other factors arising from prospective utilization of such portion of the business or entity by noble. in the event that noble does not exercise its first-priority right of acquisition on these terms and conditions, or in the event that noble does exercise its right but the transaction is not consummated (otherwise than due to an unreasonable or bad faith refusal by arcelor to agree to 58 definitive terms of purchase and sale or breach of the definitive agreement by arcelor), then arcelor may continue to own and operate such portion of the business while noble and arcelor negotiate a mutually satisfactory resolution reasonably and in good faith. 7.9 updated disclosure document arcelor shall have a continuing obligation prior to the closing to promptly notify noble in writing with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered that, if existing or known at the date of this agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the arcelor disclosure document with respect to section 5 of this agreement. no such disclosure shall, except as otherwise set forth herein, cure any breach of any representation or warranty without noble&#146;s written waiver of the breach; and any such disclosure shall be without prejudice to arcelor&#146;s right to cure any breach of any representation or warranty as provided for herein. 7.10 confidential

confidential information of noble or noble&#146;s affiliates or their business received from or confirmed by noble or noble&#146;s affiliates and shall not disclose to any person (other than those of

confidential information for personal advantage (other than enforcement of its rights under this agreement or any of the ancillary agreements), except that arcelor and its affiliates shall be free to use and disclose all or any of such confidential information that: (i) was already in arcelor&#146;s or its affiliate&#146;s possession at the time of disclosure to arcelor or is subsequently

avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the confidentiality agreement is superseded by the provisions of this section. 7.11 standstill arcelor&#146;s obligations under section 6

agreements, the arcelor disclosure document and the noble disclosure document embody the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other agreements, representations or warranties, oral or written, between the parties other than those set forth or provided for therein, including the confidentiality agreement and the binding letter of intent. this agreement may not be modified or changed, in whole or in part, except by a supplemental writing signed by each of the parties. 17.5 powerlasers (a) if arcelor is permitted to directly or indirectly sell the shares of powerlasers to noble, then noble shall purchase such shares from arcelor (or from dofasco, as the case may be). in connection with the sale and purchase of powerlasers, arcelor will represent and warrant to noble that (i) the powerlasers business, assets and assumed liabilities as of the closing do not include any liabilities other than employment-related liabilities and trade payables other than transaction costs, and (ii) powerlasers has sufficient, positive net working capital to continue operation of its business consistent with past practice. the definitive agreement governing the sale of powerlasers shall contain substantially the same representations, warranties and conditions as this agreement, except that the powerlasers agreement (x) will include reasonable adjustments based on the smaller size of the powerlasers transaction and (y) will not include a material adverse change condition, except with respect to any event occurring in 2007 that would have a material adverse effect (other than a reduction in ebitda) on the powerlasers business, considered as a whole. (b) accordingly, if arcelor is permitted directly or indirectly to sell powerlasers to noble, the aggregate consideration payable by noble for purchase of all the shares of powerlasers will be noble&#146;s one-year promissory note for $50 million, bearing interest at the prime rate and subordinated in favor of noble&#146;s senior credit facilities (which note shall be transferable to arcelor or its affiliates), to be delivered at closing of the purchase and sale of powerlasers. if the audited 2006 ebitda of powerlasers is less than (canadian) $7,750,000, then such note shall be for a principal amount of (a) $50,000,000 us dollars less (b) the us dollar equivalent of the product of (i) 6.5 times (ii) the difference between (canadian) $7,750,000 and the audited 2006 ebitda of powerlasers. (c) moreover, if arcelor is permitted directly or indirectly to sell powerlasers to noble, then the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the closing to occur within sixty days after arcelor notifies noble that arcelor has become able to sell powerlasers, but no sooner than sixty days after the closing. 17.6 dofasco to the extent permitted by applicable law and with specific reference to the copperweld business owned by dofasco, arcelor agrees to use such influence as it may have and is legally permitted to use as beneficiary of the trust that owns dofasco to encourage dofasco to cooperate lawfully 87 with noble, after the closing, relative to the development and commercialization of structural tube technology. references in this agreement to actions that a party hereto is to take or refrain from taking are intended to include, where the context requires, such party&#146;s causing one or more of its affiliates to take or refrain from taking such action, but they exclude efforts or action on the part of any party, affiliate or other person that would violate applicable law. 17.7 parties in interest; nonassignability this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but shall not be assignable by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign any rights under this agreement to any direct or indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of such party and either party may perform its obligations under this agreement through one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. nothing contained in this agreement is intended to confer any legal or equitable rights, remedies, claims, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this agreement upon any person other than (a) the parties to this agreement, (b) other parties to which rights are specifically granted in this agreement (for example, rights of arcelor&#146;s affiliates and group members to indemnification) and (iii) such parties&#146; and such other parties&#146; respective successors and permitted assigns. 17.8 governing law; venue; waiver of jury trial (a) this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york. each of the ancillary agreements, other than the assignment agreement, the assumption agreement, the intellectual property license agreement, the supply and auto services agreement, the contract manufacturing agreement, the transition services agreement and the master lease agreement (collectively, the &#147;french agreements&#148; ), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york. each of the french agreements shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the republic of france. (b) each party (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york (or, if that court shall decline jurisdiction, then the supreme court of the state of new york, new york county) solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this agreement and the ancillary agreements (other than the french agreements, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section below), and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the ancillary agreements (other than the french agreements, except as so provided below), and (ii) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement of this agreement or of any ancillary agreement (other than the french agreements, except as so provided below) (a) that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said court or that the venue thereof is not appropriate or (b) that this agreement or any ancillary agreement (other than the french agreements, except as so provided below) may not be enforced in or by such court. the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard or 88 determined in such court. the parties hereby consent to and grant such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding by certified mail in the manner provided in section 17.3 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. each party agrees that service of process by notice in accordance with this agreement or by any other means permitted by rule or order of such court shall be effective service for all purposes. (c) except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section below, each party (i) irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the commercial court of paris ( le tribunal de commerce de paris ) solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement under the provisions of the french agreements, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by the french agreements, and (ii) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement of any french agreement, (a) that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said court or that the venue thereof is not appropriate or (b) that such french agreement may not be enforced in or by such court. the parties hereto irrevocably agree, except as provided in paragraph (e), that all claims with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard or determined in such court. the parties hereby consent to and grant such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding by certified mail in the manner provided in section 17.3 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. each party agrees that service of process by notice in accordance with this agreement or by any other means permitted by rule or order of such court shall be effective service for all purposes. (d) each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this agreement or under any ancillary agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this agreement, any ancillary agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. each party acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver; (ii) such party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver; (iii) such party makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers in this section. (e) the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall also apply to any french agreement and (by incorporation therein) the parties thereto if issues of law arise in an action, suit or proceeding commenced under or in respect of both such french agreement, on the one hand, and this agreement or an ancillary agreement (other than another french agreement), on the other hand. by way of illustration and not limitation, if a suit between the parties were to arise as to the correct interpretation of the contract manufacturing agreement and this agreement, then, 89 according to the principles of this section, the contract manufacturing agreement would be governed by and construed in accordance with french law, this agreement would be governed by and construed in accordance with new york law, and the only proper jurisdiction and venue for the suit would be the united states district court for the southern district of new york (or, if that court were to decline jurisdiction or venue, then the supreme court of the state of new york, new york county). 17.9 headings; references to sections and exhibits the headings of the sections and subsections of this agreement are solely for convenience of reference and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement. the arcelor disclosure document and the noble disclosure document are numbered for convenience purposes only to coincide with the numbering of the sections. it is therefore agreed that a disclosure for one section is a disclosure for all sections herein. all references to sections and exhibits, unless otherwise indicated, are references to sections of and exhibits to this agreement, and a reference to a section shall also be a reference to all subsections of such section. 17.10 further assurances from time to time before or after closing, at a party&#146;s request and without further consideration, the other party shall execute and deliver, and cause its affiliates to execute and deliver, to the requesting party such documents and take, and cause its affiliates to take, such other action as the requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the transactions or the reorganization. 18. entering into force this agreement shall enter into force and effect and become legally valid, binding upon and enforceable against the parties hereto upon the due execution and delivery thereof by arcelor and noble.
