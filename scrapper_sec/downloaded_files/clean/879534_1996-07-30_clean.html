pages item 1. security and issuer. this schedule 13d relates to the common stock, $0.001 par value per share ("pci common stock"), of pci services, inc., a delaware corporation ("pci"). the principal executive offices of pci are located at 1403 foulk road, suite 102, wilmington, delaware 19803. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is filed by cardinal health, inc., an ohio corporation ("cardinal"). cardinal is a national health care service provider, providing an array of value-added pharmaceutical distribution services to a broad base of customers nationwide. through its wholly owned subsidiary, pyxis corporation, cardinal develops and manufactures point-of-use systems which automate the distribution, management and control of medications and supplies in hospitals and alternate care facilities. cardinal is also a franchisor of retail pharmacies through its wholly owned subsidiary, medicine shoppe international, inc. in addition, cardinal's subsidiary allied pharmacy management, inc. is a provider of pharmacy management services to hospitals. cardinal's principal executive offices are located at 5555 glendon court, dublin, ohio 43016. each executive officer and each director of cardinal is a citizen of the united states. the name, business address and present principal occupation of each executive officer and director are set forth in annex i to this schedule 13d which is incorporated herein by this reference. during the last five years, to the best of cardinal's knowledge, neither cardinal nor any of its executive officers or directors has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which cardinal or such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or finding any violation with respect to such laws, and which judgment, decree or final order was not subsequently vacated. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to the stock option agreement, dated july 23, 1996, between cardinal, mediq incorporated, a delaware corporation, and mediq investment services, inc., a delaware corporation (together with mediq incorporated, "mediq") and a wholly owned subsidiary of mediq incorporated, mediq granted cardinal an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase from mediq, under certain circumstances and subject to certain adjustments, all of the issued and outstanding shares of pci common stock owned, directly or indirectly, or thereafter page 3 of 11 pages acquired, directly or indirectly, by mediq, at a price per share, payable in cash, equal to the lower of (x) $23.00 or (y) the exchange ratio under the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of july 23, 1996, among cardinal, panther merger corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of cardinal ("subcorp"), pci and mediq incorporated (the "merger agreement"), described under item 4 below, multiplied by the closing price of cardinal common shares, without par value ("cardinal common shares"), as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of delivery to pci of written notice of cardinal's exercise of the option. the stock option agreement provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will such purchase price be less than $19.53 per share. as of the date hereof, the option is not exercisable. in the stock option agreement, mediq has represented to cardinal that the number of shares of pci common stock currently owned by mediq and subject to the option is 2,875,000. cardinal may exercise the option in whole or in part; provided that to the extent that cardinal exercises the option in part, cardinal may only exercise the option for up to 390,499 shares of pci common stock in the aggregate, unless cardinal exercises the option for at least 2,253,876 shares of pci common stock in the aggregate. the option was granted by mediq as a condition of and in consideration for cardinal entering into the merger agreement. the exercise of the option for the full number of shares currently covered thereby would require aggregate funds of $65,084,250, based on an exchange ratio of .336 and a closing price for cardinal common share of $67.375 on july 25, 1996. it is anticipated that, should the option become exercisable and should cardinal determine to exercise the option, cardinal would obtain the funds for purchase from working capital or by borrowing from parties whose identity is not yet known. a copy of the stock option agreement is included as exhibit 2.2 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. item 4. purpose of transaction. in connection with the execution of the stock option agreement, cardinal, subcorp, pci and mediq incorporated entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which, among other matters and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, subcorp will merge with and into pci, with pci as the surviving corporation (the "merger"). the option was granted by mediq as a condition of and in consideration for cardinal entering into the merger agreement. consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including: (i) receipt of the approval of the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of pci common stock; (ii) expiration or page 4 of 11 pages termination of all waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended; (iii) registration of the cardinal common shares to be issued in the merger under the securities act of 1933, as amended; (iv) receipt by cardinal of an accountant's letter confirming that the merger will qualify as a pooling of interests transaction for financial reporting purposes; and (v) satisfaction of certain other conditions. pursuant to the merger agreement, (a) the officers of the surviving corporation in the merger will be the officers of pci, (b) the directors of the surviving corporation in the merger will be the directors of subcorp, (c) each share of pci common stock will be converted into .336 of a cardinal common shares, subject to adjustment under the circumstances described in the merger agreement, plus cash in lieu of receipt of fractional cardinal common shares, and (d) at the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of pci, as the surviving corporation, will be amended to be identical (save for the name of the corporation) to those of subcorp. upon consummation of the merger, the pci common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market. a copy of the merger agreement is included as exhibit 2.1 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. except as set forth herein, cardinal does not have any current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional shares of pci common stock or the disposition of shares of pci common stock; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving pci or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of any material amount of assets of pci or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the present board of directors or management of pci, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any vacancies on the board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of pci; (vi) any other material change in pci's business or corporate structure; (vii) any change in pci's charter or bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto, or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of pci by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of pci to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (ix) a class of equity securities of pci becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. page 5 of 11 pages item 5. interest in securities of issuer. although the option does not allow cardinal to purchase any shares of pci common stock pursuant thereto unless and until the conditions to exercise specified in the stock option agreement occur, assuming for purposes of this item 5 that such conditions are satisfied and cardinal is entitled to purchase shares of pci common stock pursuant to the option, cardinal would currently be entitled to purchase 2,875,000 shares of pci common stock, or approximately 46.3% of the outstanding pci common stock (based upon 6,211,250 shares of pci common stock outstanding as of july 23, 1996, as represented by pci in the merger agreement). cardinal does not currently have the right to acquire any shares of pci common stock under the option unless certain events specified in the stock option agreement occur. accordingly, cardinal does not have sole or shared voting or dispositive power with respect to any shares of pci common stock, and cardinal disclaims beneficial ownership of pci common stock subject to the option until such events occur. assuming for purposes of this item 5 that events occurred that would enable cardinal to exercise the option and cardinal exercised the option, cardinal would have sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the shares of pci common stock acquired pursuant to the option. the foregoing description of certain terms of the stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the stock option agreement which is filed as exhibit 2.2 hereto and which is incorporated herein by this reference. to the best of cardinal's knowledge, no executive officer or director of cardinal beneficially owns any shares of pci common stock, nor (except for the issuance of the option) have any transactions in pci common stock been effected during the past 60 days by cardinal or, to the best knowledge of cardinal, by any executive officer or director of cardinal. in addition, no other person is known by cardinal to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities covered by this schedule 13d. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. each of mediq and the persons set forth in annex ii to this schedule 13d, which annex ii is incorporated herein by this reference, has entered into an agreement with cardinal pursuant to which, among other matters, such person has agreed (i) to vote all of the shares of pci common stock beneficially owned by such person or its affiliates or over which such person or any of its affiliates has voting power or control to approve the merger and the merger agreement, (ii) not to vote such shares in favor of any other recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving pci, or acquisition of any capital stock or page 6 of 11 pages any material portion of the assets (except for acquisitions of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) of pci and (iii) not to, and not to permit any company, trust or other entity controlled by such person to, and not to permit any of its affiliates to, contract to sell, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of such shares or any interest therein or securities convertible thereinto or any voting rights with respect thereto other than pursuant to the merger or without cardinal's consent. mediq is estimated to have voting power over approximately 46.3% of the outstanding shares of pci common stock, based upon 6,211,250 shares of pci common stock outstanding as of july 23, 1996, as represented by pci in the merger agreement. a copy of the support/voting agreement, dated as of july 23, 1996, executed by mediq (the "mediq support/voting agreement") is included as exhibit 99.1 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the mediq support/voting agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. the persons listed on annex ii in the aggregate are estimated to have voting power over approximately 3.2% of

common stock outstanding as of july 23, 1996, as represented by pci in the merger agreement. cardinal may hereafter enter into similar agreements with other holders of pci common stock. a copy of the

more fully provided herein. b. pci desires to combine its pharmaceutical packag- ing and other businesses with the wholesale drug distribution and related businesses operated by cardinal and for the holders of shares of pci common stock ("pci stockholders") to have a continuing equity interest in the combined cardinal/pci busi- nesses. c. mediq, as the beneficial owner of 2,875,000 shares of pci

surviving corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this agreement, and the officers and di- rectors of the surviving corporation are authorized in the name of pci or otherwise to take any and all such action. article ii conversion of securities 2.1 conversion of capital stock. at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of cardinal, subcorp or pci: (a) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of subcorp issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the surviving corporation. such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the surviv- ing corporation. -3- (b) each share of pci common stock issued and out- standing immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and represent a number of cardinal common shares equal to the exchange ratio (as defined below). (c) each share of capital stock of pci held in the treasury of pci shall be cancelled and retired and no pay- ment shall be made in respect thereof. 2.2 exchange ratio; fractional shares. the "ex- change ratio" shall equal (i) if cardinal has not made an ad- justment election (as defined in section 7.1(d)), .336 or (ii) if cardinal has made an adjustment election, then the product of (x) .336 and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing 58.12 by the average of the closing prices of cardinal common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") composite tape ("nyse composite tape") on each of the last 15 trading days ending on the sixth trading day prior to the meeting of pci stockholders at which the vote to approve the merger occurs (the "average share price"). no certificates for fractional cardinal common shares shall be issued as a result of the conversion provided for in section 2.1(b). to the extent that an outstanding share of pci common stock would otherwise have become a fractional cardinal common share, the holder thereof, upon presentation of such fractional interest represented by an appropriate certificate for pci common stock to the exchange agent pursuant to section 2.3, shall be entitled to receive a cash payment therefor in an amount equal to the value (de- termined with reference to the closing price of cardinal common shares on the nyse composite tape on the last full trading day immediately prior to the effective time) of such fractional interest. such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a separately bargained for, consideration. if more than one certificate representing shares of pci common stock shall be surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of cardinal common shares for which certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by the certificates so surrendered. in the event that prior to the effective time cardinal shall declare a stock dividend or other distribution payable in cardinal common shares or securities convertible into cardinal common shares, or effect a stock split, reclas- sification, combination or other change with respect to cardinal common shares, the exchange ratio set forth in this section 2.2 shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such dividend, distribution, stock split, reclassification, combination or other change. -4- 2.3 exchange of certificates. (a) exchange agent. promptly following the effec- tive time, cardinal shall deposit with boatmen's trust company or such other exchange agent as may be designated by cardinal (the "exchange agent"), for the benefit of pci stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this section 2.3, certificates representing cardinal common shares issuable pursuant to section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of pci common stock and shall from time-to-time deposit cash in an amount reasonably expected to be paid pursuant to section 2.2 (such cardinal common shares and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "exchange fund"). (b) exchange procedures. as soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "cer- tificates") which immediately prior to the effective time rep- resented outstanding shares of pci common stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive cardinal common shares pursuant to section 2.1(b) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as cardinal may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing cardinal common shares. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent, together with a duly ex- ecuted letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a cer- tificate representing that whole number of cardinal common shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to section 2.1 and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this article ii, after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and the shares represented by the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. no interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of shares of pci common stock. in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of pci common stock which is not registered on the transfer records of pci, a certificate representing the proper number of cardinal common shares, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to such transferee if the certificate representing such shares of -5- pci common stock held by such transferee is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evi- dence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any appli- cable stock transfer taxes have been paid. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.3, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing cardinal common shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as pro- vided in this article ii. (c) distributions with respect to unexchanged shares. notwithstanding any other provisions of this agree- ment, no dividends or other distributions declared or made af- ter the effective time with respect to cardinal common shares having a record date after the effective time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate, and no cash pay- ment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder shall surrender such certificate as provided in this section 2.3. subject to the effect of appli- cable laws (as defined in section 4.9), following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole cardinal common shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the effective time theretofore payable with respect to such whole cardinal common shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole cardinal common shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon. (d) no further ownership rights in pci common stock. all cardinal common shares issued upon surrender of certifi- cates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to this article ii) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of pci common stock represented thereby, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of pci of shares of pci common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and ex- changed as provided in this section 2.3. certificates sur- rendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of pci for purposes of rule 145(c) under the securities act of -6- 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), shall not be exchanged until cardinal has received written undertakings from such person in the form attached hereto as exhibit a. (e) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to pci stockhold- ers for six months after the effective time shall be delivered to cardinal, upon demand thereby, and holders of shares of pci common stock who have not theretofore complied with this sec- tion 2.3 shall thereafter look only to cardinal for payment of any claim to cardinal common shares, cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, or dividends or distributions, if any, in re- spect thereof. (f) no liability. none of cardinal, the surviving corporation or the exchange agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of pci common stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the exchange fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. if any certifi- cates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years af- ter the effective time of the merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any cash in lieu of frac- tional shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to whole shares of pci common stock in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any gov- ernmental authority (as defined in section 3.4)), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, become the property of cardinal, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (g) investment of exchange fund. the exchange agent shall invest any cash included in the exchange fund, as di- rected by cardinal, on a daily basis. any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to cardinal upon termination of the exchange fund pursuant to section 2.3(e). 2.4 treatment of stock options.

the securities act if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of pci common stock that have been acquired upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition requested by any such holder. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by pci for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed

between cardinal health, inc., an ohio corporation ("cardinal"), mediq investment services, inc., a delaware corporation ("mediq investment"), and mediq incorporated, a delaware corporation (together with mediq investment, "mediq"). w i t n e s s e t h: whereas, the board of directors of cardinal, the board of directors of pci services, inc., a delaware corporation ("pci"), and the board of directors of mediq have approved an agreement and plan of merger dated as of even date herewith (the "merger agreement") providing for the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of cardinal with and into pci; whereas, as a condition and inducement to cardinal's willingness to enter into the merger agreement, cardinal has required that mediq agree, and mediq has agreed, to grant to cardinal the option set forth herein to purchase all shares of pci common stock owned, directly or indirectly, or hereafter acquired, directly or indirectly, by mediq (the "shares"); now, therefore, in consideration of the premises herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 1. definitions. capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings as in the merger agreement. 2. grant of option. subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, mediq hereby grants to cardinal an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase all of the shares at a price per share (the "purchase price") equal to the lower of (x) $23.00 or (y) the exchange ratio multiplied by the closing price of cardinal common shares as reported on the nyse composite tape on the last trading day immediately preceding the notice date (as hereinafter defined), payable in cash as provided in sec- tion 4 hereof, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the purchase price be less than $19.53. 3. exercise of option. (a) cardinal may exercise the option, in whole or (subject to the limitation set forth in the last sentence hereof) in part, at any time or from time to time if a purchase event (as defined below) shall have occurred; provided, however, that, to the extent the option shall not have been previously exercised, it shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agree- ment in accordance with sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c) (other than a termination by cardinal pursuant to section 7.1(c) of the merger agreement if pci's, mediq's or pci's affiliate's failure to perform any material covenant or obli- gation under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before january 31, 1997), or 7.1(d) of the merger agreement; pro- vided further, however, if (x) the merger agreement is termi- nated other than as provided in clause (ii) above, or (y) the termination of the merger agreement (other than a termination (i) pursuant to section 7.1(a) or (ii) by pci pursuant to section 7.1(c) of the merger agreement if cardinal's or cardinal's affiliate's failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to oc- cur on or before january 31, 1997) occurs after a purchase event, the option shall not terminate until the date that is 6 months following such termination. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the option cannot be exercised before its date of termination as a result of any injunction, order or simi- lar restraint issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, the option shall expire on the 30th business day after such injunction, order or restraint shall have been dissolved or when such injunction, order or restraint shall have become permanent and no longer subject to appeal, as the case may be. to the extent cardinal exercises the option in part, cardinal may only exercise the option for up to 390,499 shares in the aggregate, unless cardinal exercises the option for at least 2,253,876 shares in the aggregate. (b) as used herein, a "purchase event" shall mean any of the following events: (i) any person (other than cardinal or any of its subsidiaries) shall have commenced (as such term is defined in rule 14d-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")), or shall have filed a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any shares of pci common stock such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the then outstanding pci common stock; (ii) pci or any of its subsidiaries shall or shall have entered into, authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced an intention to enter into, autho- rize, recommend, or propose, an agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than cardinal or any -2- of its subsidiaries) to, or any person (other than cardinal or any of its subsidiaries) shall have publicly announced a bona fide present intention to, (a) effect any competing transaction with pci, (b) purchase, lease or otherwise acquire 10% or more of the assets of pci and its consolidated subsidiaries or (c) purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consoli- dation, tender or exchange offer or similar transaction) beneficial ownership (as defined below) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of pci or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined under regulation s-x); (iii) any person (other than cardinal or any subsid- iary of cardinal, and other than mediq) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of pci; (iv) mediq shall have hereafter acquired beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of an additional 1% or more of the voting power of pci over that which it currently possesses, not including any increase resulting solely from the purchase or other acquisition by pci of shares of pci common stock; (v) pci's board of directors shall have withdrawn, modified or changed in a manner adverse to cardinal, or refused to reaffirm within two business days of any written request from cardinal which request was made upon a reasonable basis, the recommendation of pci's board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and/or the merger; (vi) if mediq shall have breached any of its obli- gations under that certain support/voting agreement, dated the date hereof, between mediq and cardinal or under the merger agreement; (vii) if at the meeting of pci stockholders (includ- ing any adjournment or postponement thereof) the requi- site vote of the pci stockholders to approve the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agree- ment shall not have been obtained; or (viii) the merger agreement shall have been termi- nated by either party pursuant to section 7.1 thereof (other than a termination pursuant to sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c) (other than a termination by cardinal pursuant to section 7.1(c) of the merger agreement if pci's, -3- mediq's or pci's affiliate's failure to perform any ma- terial covenant or obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before january 31, 1997), or 7.1(d)) or any event shall have occurred that would cause any party thereto to have the right to so termi- nate the merger agreement. (c) as used herein, the terms "beneficial owner- ship", "beneficial owner" and "beneficially own" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in rule 13d-3 under the ex- change act. as used herein, "person" shall have the meaning specified in sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the exchange act. (d) in the event cardinal wishes to exercise the option, it shall deliver to mediq a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it intends to pur- chase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than two business days nor later than 30 calendar days from the notice date for the closing of such purchase (the "closing date"); provided that if the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the option (the "closing") cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and, provided further that, without limiting the foregoing, if prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is required in connection with such purchase, cardinal and, if applicable, mediq shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same (and mediq shall cooperate with cardinal in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval), and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained, and in either event, any requisite waiting period has passed. (e) in the event (i) cardinal receives official notice that an approval of any regulatory authority required for the purchase of the shares pursuant to exercise of the option would not be issued or granted or (ii) a closing date shall not have occurred within 9 months after the related notice date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval, cardinal shall be entitled, to the extent legally permitted, to -4- exercise the option in connection with the resale of pci com- mon stock or other securities pursuant to a registration statement as provided in section 8.11 of the merger agreement. the provisions of this section 3 and section 6 shall apply with appropriate adjustments to any such exercise. 4. payment and delivery of certificates. (a) at the closing, referred to in section 3 hereof, cardinal shall pay to mediq the aggregate purchase price for the shares of pci common stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated not later than one business day prior to the closing date by mediq. (b) at such closing, simultaneously with the de- livery of cash as provided in section 4(a), mediq shall transfer to cardinal good, valid and marketable title to, and shall deliver to cardinal a certificate or certificates representing, the number of shares purchased by cardinal, registered in the name of cardinal or a nominee designated in writing by cardinal (or, if it is not possible to have such registration completed prior to the closing, the certificate(s) delivered shall be accompanied by appropriate stock power(s) in form reasonably satisfactory to cardinal), which shares shall be fully paid and non-assessable and free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever. (c) if at the time of issuance of any pci common stock pursuant to any exercise of the option, pci shall have issued any share purchase rights or similar securities to holders of pci common stock, then each such share shall also represent rights with terms substantially the same as and at least as favorable to cardinal as those issued to mediq. 5. authorization, etc. (a) mediq hereby represents and warrants to cardinal that: (i) mediq has full corporate authority to execute and deliver this option agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) such execution, delivery and consummation have been authorized by the board of directors of mediq, and no other corporate proceedings are necessary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and val- idly executed and delivered and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of mediq, enforceable against mediq in accordance with its terms; -5- (iv) mediq investment is the registered owner, and mediq incorporated is the sole beneficial owner (in ad- dition to the registered owner), of, and has good, valid and marketable title to, 2,875,000 shares of pci common stock, which are all of the shares of pci common stock owned, directly or indirectly, by mediq, and mediq does not have any right to acquire any additional shares of pci common stock; and (v) mediq has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and permit it to sell the shares upon exer- cise of the option, all of which, upon sale pursuant hereto, shall have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances, re- strictions and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. (b) cardinal hereby represents and warrants to mediq that: (i) cardinal has full corporate authority to ex- ecute and deliver this option agreement and to consum- mate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) such execution, delivery and consummation have been authorized by all requisite corporate action by cardinal, and no other corporate proceedings are neces- sary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and val- idly executed and delivered and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of cardinal, enforceable against cardinal in accordance with its terms; and (iv) any pci common stock or other securities acquired by cardinal upon exercise of the option will not be taken with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in compliance with the securities act. 6. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. in the event of any change in pci common stock by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, and the purchase price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately so that cardinal shall receive upon exercise of the option the same class and -6- number of outstanding shares or other securities or property that cardinal would have received in respect of pci common stock if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. 7. severability. any term, provision, covenant or restriction con- tained in this option agreement held by a court or other gov- ernmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, voidness or unenforceability, but neither the remaining terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this option agreement nor the validity or en- forceability thereof in any other jurisdiction shall be af- fected or impaired thereby. any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this option agreement that is so found to be so broad as to be unenforceable shall be inter- preted to be as broad as is enforceable. 8. miscellaneous.
