term sheet &#8221; and together with this letter, the &#8220; commitment letter &#8221;), it hereby commits to (i) provide an amount equal to the aggregate commitment amount of the senior credit facility, which will be governed by the initial borrowing base, and (ii) act as sole administrative agent (in such capacity, the &#8220; administrative agent &#8221;) for a syndicate of lenders that will partici pate in the senior credit facility and to act as issuing bank (in such capacity, the &#8220; issuing bank &#8221;).&#160;&#160;bmocm is pleased to confirm that it will act as lead arranger (in such capacity, the &#8220; arranger &#8221;).&#160;&#160;the arranger may syndicate a portion of its commitment to a syndicate of lenders, each of which shall be a reputable fund or financial institution selected by the arranger and agreed to by the borrower (together with bmo, the &#8220; lenders &#8221;). &#160; the senior credit facility will be provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of, and shall become effective only upon the execution and delivery of, a mutually satisfactory credit agreement and other definitive loan documentation incorporating the terms and conditions set forth in the term sheet, your payment of certain fees to the arranger and the administrative agent agreed among the parties hereto and other terms and conditions customarily included in credit facilities of this type, amount and purpose.&#160;&#160;these terms and conditions will necessarily be further developed during the course of preparing and negotiating the loan documentation.&#160;&#160;please note that those matters that are not covered or made clear in this commitment letter or in any related fee letter of even date herewith (any &#8220 ; fee letter &#8221;) are subject to mutual agreement of the parties hereto.&#160;&#160;the terms and conditions of this commitment letter may be modified only in a written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto. &#160;

you agree to actively assist the arranger in achieving a successful syndication of the senior credit facility that is satisfactory to you and the arranger.&#160;&#160;such assistance shall include, without limitation: (a) your providing and causing your advisors to provide to the arranger and the lenders, upon request, all information reasonably deemed necessary by the arranger to complete such syndication; (b) your assistance in the preparation of an information package for delivery to potential syndication members and participants; (c) your using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such syndication efforts benefit materially from your existing lending and investment banking relationships; and (d) your additional assistance in such syndication efforts, including by making available from time to time repr esentatives and senior management and advisors of the borrower and any indirect or direct subsidiaries, if any, of the borrower (such subsidiaries together, the &#8220; guarantors &#8221;), to attend and make presentations regarding the business and prospects of the borrower and the guarantors, as appropriate, at one or more meetings of prospective lenders, in each case upon reasonable prior notice and at reasonably convenient times and locations.&#160;&#160;you and the guarantors each agree to refrain from any other debt, equity or other financings (including refinancings and renewals of debt) during the syndication process, unless otherwise agreed to by the administrative agent and the arranger, which agreement will not be unreasonably withheld; provided , however , it is agreed that the borrower may (i) engage in a pu blic or private offering of its preferred stock and (ii) sell its common or preferred stock in &#8220;at the market&#8221; offerings. &#160; the commitments of bmo and bmocm hereunder are further subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions precedent in a manner acceptable to us in our sole discretion unless otherwise noted herein: (a) the completion of all due diligence, including but not limited to business, engineering, legal, environmental, tax, financial and accounting due diligence in connection with the senior credit facility or with respect to the borrower and the guarantors, in scope and with results satisfactory to us in our sole discretion;

(d)&#160;the absence of any change, occurrence or development that could, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on the business, property, assets, nature of assets, operations, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) of the borrower or the guarantors, or on the ability of the borrower to perform its obligations under the senior credit facility or the loan documents evidencing the senior credit facility; (e)&#160;our not becoming aware after the date hereof of any information or other matter that, in our judgment, is inconsistent in a material and adverse manner with any information or other matter disclosed to us prior to the date hereof (in which case we may, in our sole dis cretion, suggest alternative financing amounts or structures that ensure adequate protection for the lenders or terminate this commitment letter and any commitment or undertaking hereunder); (f)&#160;our reasonable satisfaction that, prior to and until the completion of the successful syndication of the senior credit facility, there shall be no competing offering, placement or arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing by or on behalf of the borrower; and (g) the other conditions set forth or referred to herein or in the term sheet. &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; you hereby represent, warrant and covenant that: (a) all information that has been or is hereafter made available to us or the lenders by you or any of your representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the &#8220; information &#8221;) is and will be complete and correct in all material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading (including, without limitation, financial information prepared on a pro forma basis) and (b) all financial projections, if any, that have been or are hereafter made available to the arranger or any lender by yo u or any of your representatives (the &#8220; projections &#8221;) have been or will be prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions (it being understood that such projections are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the borrower&#8217;s control, and that no assurances can be given that the projections will be realized).&#160;&#160;you agree to furnish us with such information and projections as we may reasonably request and to supplement the information and the projections from time to time until the closing date so that the representations, warranties and covenants in the preceding sentence are correct on such closing date.&#160;&#160;you understand that in arranging and syndicating the senior credit facility, the arranger will be using and relying on the information and the projections without independent verification thereof. &#160; by acceptance of this commitment and to induce us to issue this commitment letter and to proceed with the documentation of the proposed financing, you agree to reimburse us on the closing date, an amount not to exceed $150,000 without prior approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld, for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses to the extent invoiced) that we have incurred in conjunction with the negotiation, preparation, syndication, execution and delivery of the senior credit facility, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with performing due diligence in connection with the senior credit facility; provided , however, that in the event that definitive credit documentation is no t executed or the senior credit facility fails to close as the result of any action, or failure to take any action, by the borrower in violation of this commitment letter, then you hereby agree that all such costs and expenses shall be for your account and agree to reimburse us from time to time upon demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in conjunction with the negotiation, preparation and syndication of the senior credit facility, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with performing due diligence in connection with the senior credit facility. &#160;
