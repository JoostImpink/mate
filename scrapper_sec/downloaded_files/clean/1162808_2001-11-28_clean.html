disability. if the optionee is terminated from his or her employment with the company by reason of disability, then all unvested options shall automatically terminate and be canceled without any action on the part of the company, on the effective date of such termination. all options that have vested prior to such date shall remain exercisable until the earlier to occur of (1) the first

above, or death, then all unvested options shall automatically terminate and be canceled (without any action on the part of the company) on the date of such termination. all options that have vested prior to such date shall remain exercisable until the earlier to occur of the ninetieth day following such date and the expiration of the option term. 9. death of optionee and transfer of option. if the optionee dies while in the employ of the company or a subsidiary or within a period of three months after the termination of his or her employment with the company and all subsidiaries, then all

consolidation, combination, subdivision or exchange of shares, separation, reorganization, distribution or liquidation occurring after the date hereof, as a result of which shares of the common stock, or shares of common stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of the same or another class of classes, the optionee shall receive, for the aggregate price paid upon such exercise, the aggregate number and class of shares which, if shares of common stock (as authorized at the date hereof) had been purchased at the date hereof for the same aggregate price (on the basis of price per share set forth in paragraph 2 hereof) and had not been disposed of, such person or persons would be holding at the time of such exercise as a result of such purchase and all such stock dividends, stock split-ups, recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, combinations, subdivisions or exchanges of shares, separations, reorganizations, distributions or liquidations; provided, however, that no fractional share shall be issued upon any such exercise, and any aggregate price paid shall be appropriately reduced on account of any fractional share not issued. if the company subdivides or combines its outstanding shares of common stock, the exercise price shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the number or shares outstanding as a result of such subdivision or combination. 11. method of exercising options. subject to the terms and conditions of these options, the options may be exercised by written notice (an "exercise notice") to the company presented any time prior to termination of this options. the exercise date will be the date of the written notice to the company. such exercise notice shall state the number of shares in

that the optionee or other person entitled to exercise the options intends to hold such stock for investment. the option exercise price shall become immediately due upon exercise of the option and shall be paid in cash or check made payable to the corporation. should the corporation's outstanding common stock be registered under section 12(g) of the exchange act at the time the option is exercised, then the exercise price may also be paid as follows: (i) in shares of stock held by the optionee for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the corporation's earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at fair market value on the exercise date, or (ii) through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the optionee shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (a) to a corporation designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the corporation by reason of such purchase, and (b) to the corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction. at the discretion of the board, exercisable either at the time of option grant or of option exercise, the exercise price may also be paid (i) by optionee's delivery of a promissory note in form and substance satisfactory to the corporation and permissible under the delaware securities regulations and bearing interest at a rate determined by the board in its sole discretion, but in no event less than the minimum rate of interest required to avoid the imputation of compensation income to the optionee under the federal tax laws, or (ii) in such other form of consideration permitted by the delaware corporation laws as may be acceptable to the board. in the event the option shall be exercised by another pursuant to the provisions providing for the contingency of death of the optionee, such exercise notice shall be accompanied by the appropriate proof of right of such person or persons to exercise the option. 12. restrictions on issuance of shares. the company shall at all times during the term of the option reserve and keep available such number of shares of common stock as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this option. the company shall pay all original issue and transfer taxes with respect to the issuance and transfer of shares pursuant thereto and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the company in connection therewith; and it will from time to time use its best efforts to comply with all laws and regulations which, in the opinion of counsel for the company, shall be applicable thereto. . if required, the optionee shall represent that any stock acquired by him or her under this option shall be purchased for investment and not with the intention of reselling the same. in connection with the foregoing, the optionee consents to the company legending certificated for said shares and marking the stock transfer books to indicate this investment intent and the restriction on transfer contemplated hereby. 13. reacquisition, replacement and re-issuance of options. the board, with or without the consent of the optionee, may at any time cause the company to reacquire and cancel any outstanding and unexercised options, or any portion thereof. in such event, the company shall pay to such optionee an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the fair market value of the shares of stock subject to such options, or portion thereof, at the time of reacquisition, over (ii) the option price of such options or portion thereof. the company may withhold from any such payment applicable taxes and other amounts. in the event that the exercise price of such option, or portion thereof, exceeds the fair market value of the shares of stock to such option, or portion thereof, at the time of reacquisition, such option may be reacquired and canceled by the company without payment therefor. 14. options subject to all of the plan terms. this agreement and the options shall be subject to the plan, the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the plan and this agreement shall be governed by the plan. 15. voluntary surrender of options. the board may permit the voluntary surrender of all portion of any options to be conditioned upon the granting to the optionee of a new option for the same or different number of shares of stock as the option surrendered, or may require such voluntary surrender as a condition to a grant of a new option to such optionee. such new options shall be exercisable at the price, during the period and in accordance with any other terms or conditions specified by the committee at the time the new options are granted, all determined in accordance with the provisions of the plan without regards to the price, period of exercise, or any other terms or conditions of the options surrendered. 16. approval of counsel. any exercise of the options and the issuance and delivery of shares of common stock pursuant thereto shall be subject to approval, by the company's counsel, of all legal matters in connection therewith, including compliance with the requirements of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations there under, the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the common stock may then be listed and any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws. the optionee understands that, as of the date hereof, neither the options nor the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the options have been registered under the securities act or any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws 17. registration rights. if the company proposes to file a registration statement on form s-8 (or any successor form for the registration under the securities act of securities to be offered pursuant to employee benefit plans) and such form them permits the registration there under of the common stock underlying the options, the company shall include in such registration the common stock underlying the options, subject to the then applicable rules and regulations in order to permit the public resale thereof by the optionee. 18. withholding taxes. the company shall have the right to require the optionee to pay to the company in cash the amount of any federal, state, local and foreign income and other taxes that the company may be required to withhold before delivering to the optionee a certificate or certificates representing shares of common stock issuable hereunder. 19. optionee agrees to abide by the laws and regulations governing insider trading, the terms of this stock option agreement and the policies and decisions of the management of the company in all matters concerning this stock option grant. 20. disclaimer. the company will not advise optionee as to the tax consequences resulting from the execution of the designated options. it is solely the responsibility of the optionee to consult with the optionee's tax and/or financial advisors regarding any financial or tax liabilities that may result due to the execution of the options. in witness whereof, the company has executed these options as of the date of grant set forth above. max development, inc. /s/ mark elenowitz - ---------------------------------- mark elenowitz, president optionee: /s/ mark elenowitz
