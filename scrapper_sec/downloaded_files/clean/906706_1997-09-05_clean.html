accordance with the terms of their current indemnity agreements with koll and the current bylaws and certificate of incorporation of koll. 8.9 tax treatment. cbc and its subsidiaries shall not take or

(h) any amounts payable by a koll shareholder to cbc pursuant to this article 13 may be paid in cash or in cbc common received in the merger or a combination thereof. for purposes of this section 13.2(g), such cbc common shall be valued at the average closing sales price of a share of cbc common as reported on the nasdaq for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which the claim for a loss is finalized and liquidated. 13.3 indemnification by cbc. except as otherwise expressly provided in this section 13.3, on or after the closing date, cbc shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the koll shareholders and each of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, heirs and assigns (the koll shareholders and such other persons, collectively "shareholders' indemnified persons") and shall reimburse the shareholders' indemnified persons for, from and against all losses imposed on or incurred by the shareholders' indemnified persons, directly or indirectly, relating to, resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in sections 5.3(a) and 5.9 hereof in any respect, whether or not shareholders' indemnified persons relied thereon or had knowledge thereof. 13.4 notice and defense of third-party claims. if any proceeding shall be brought or asserted under this section 13.4 against an indemnified party or any successor thereto (the "indemnified person") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this article 13 from an indemnifying person or any successor thereto (the "indemnifying person"), the indemnified person shall give prompt written notice of such proceeding to the indemnifying person who shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person and the payment of all expenses; except that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying person shall relieve the indemnifying person of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. the indemnified person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing proceedings and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified person unless both the 1-40 indemnified person and the indemnifying person are named as parties and the indemnified person shall in good faith determine that the representation by the same counsel is inappropriate. in the event that the indemnifying person, within ten days after notice of any such proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified person shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such proceeding for the account of the indemnifying persons, subject to the right of the indemnifying person to assume, at its expense, the defense of such proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified person at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or final determination thereof. anything in this article 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnifying person shall not, without the indemnified person's prior written consent, settle or compromise any proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any proceeding for anything other than money damages paid by the indemnifying person. the indemnifying person may, without the indemnified person's prior written consent, settle or compromise any such proceeding or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such proceeding that requires solely the payment of money damages by the indemnifying person and that includes as an unconditional term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the indemnified person from all liability with respect to such proceeding. 13.5 exclusivity. from and after the closing date, the rights and remedies provided in this article 13 shall be the exclusive rights and remedies, contractual or otherwise, of the indemnified persons with respect to inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this agreement. article 14 payment of expenses cbc shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses incurred incident to the preparation and carrying out of the transactions herein contemplated (including legal, accounting and investment banking services and travel) provided however that the aggregate amount payable by cbc and koll for all fees and expenses of all legal counsel to koll and the koll shareholders shall not exceed $500,000 and any amount payable in excess of such amount for fees and expenses of legal counsel of koll and the koll shareholders shall be payable by the koll shareholders. cbc shall also pay all government filing fees including under the hsr act and with the sec, any state securities commission, and the department of corporations and the costs of printing, filing and mailing the form s-4 and proxy statement (collectively, the "filing fees"). notwithstanding the foregoing, koll shall bear all the filing fees and all reasonable fees and expenses (including without limitation, fees and expenses payable to counsel to cbc, outside consultants, accountants and to all investment banking firms and their respective counsel) actually incurred by cbc and acquisition corporation in the event that koll's stockholders fail to approve the merger by that date which is twenty (20) days after the effective date of the registration statement on form s-4 to be filed in connection with the merger or shareholders of koll holding over 350,000 shares exercise dissenter's rights. also notwithstanding the foregoing, if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated by october 31, 1997, each party hereto shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses and koll and the koll shareholders shall promptly reimburse cbc for any amounts advanced, reimbursed or otherwise paid to them by cbc pursuant to this provision. each party shall promptly advance upon request or reimburse such party's portion of these fees. 1-41 article 15 termination, amendment and waiver 15.1 termination. this agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the merger by the stockholders of koll and cbc: (a) by mutual written consent of koll and cbc;

(d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that -12- resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into by a holder in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. 1.7 information by holder. each holder of registrable securities shall --------------------- furnish to the company such information regarding such holder, the registrable securities held by it or him and the distribution proposed by such holder as the company may request in writing in connection with any registration, qualification, or compliance referred to in section l. 1.8 transfer or assignment of registration rights. the right to cause --------------------------------------------- the company to effect the supplemental apollo demand registration shall not be assigned or assignable by apollo. the rights to cause the company to register securities granted to a koll shareholder by the company under section 1 (other than the supplemental apollo demand registration) may be transferred or assigned by a holder only to a transferee or assignee of not less than 250,000 shares of registrable securities (as constituted at the effective time of the merger and subject to subsequent adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, and the like), provided, however, that (i) the company is given -------- ------- written notice prior to such transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of the transferee or assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, (ii) the transferee or assignee of such rights assumes in writing the obligations of such holder under this agreement and, (iii) such assignment shall be effective only if immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the securities act. the company, apollo and fs shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with any proposed transfer or assignment of the rights to cause the company to register securities under this agreement by apollo or fs to their respective limited partners and/or members; provided, however, that no -------- ------- such transfer or assignment shall be effective without the prior written consent of the company (which shall not unreasonably be withheld). for the purposes of determining the number of shares of registrable securities held by a transferee or assignee, the holdings of transferees and assignees of a partnership who are partners of such partnership (including spouses and ancestors, lineal descendants and siblings of such partners or spouses who acquire registrable securities by gift, will or intestate succession) shall be aggregated together and with the partnership. all assignees and transferees who would not qualify individually for assignment of registration rights shall have a single attorney- in-fact for the purpose of exercising any rights, receiving notices or taking any action under this agreement. 1.9 "market stand-off" agreement in connection with an underwritten --------------------------------------------------------------- public offering. if requested by the company and an underwriter of cbc common - --------------- stock (or other securities) of the company in connection with a registration by the company of cbc common stock or securities (other than indebtedness and other than preferred stock which is convertible into shares of cbc common stock) exercisable, convertible or exchangeable into shares of capital stock or other securities of the company in an offering having aggregate proceeds of $20,000,000 or more to the company, each holder of at least five percent (5%) of registrable securities shall not sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any registrable securities (or other securities) of the -13- company held by such holder (other than those included in the registration) during a reasonable and customary period of time (not to exceed 120 days) after the effective date of a registration statement of the company filed under the securities act; provided, however, that the obligations of apollo (including but -------- ------- not limited to any restriction on sale, transfer or disposition of the registrable securities held by apollo) under this section 1.9 shall terminate one year after the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement). the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares (or securities) subject to the foregoing restriction. 1.10 allocation of registration opportunities. ---------------------------------------- (a) requested registrations. except with respect to the supplemental ----------------------- apollo demand registration, in any circumstances of a requested registration pursuant to section 1.2(a) hereof in which all of the registrable securities and other shares requested to be included in such registration on behalf of the holders or other shareholders cannot be so included as a result of market limitations, as advised by the underwriter or otherwise pursuant to this agreement or, with respect to other shares, other agreements between the company and other shareholders, of the aggregate number of shares of registrable securities and other shares that may be so included, the number of shares of registrable securities and other shares that may be so included shall be allocated as follows: (i) first, among the holders requesting inclusion of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares, pro rata on the basis of the number of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares that would be held by such holders, assuming conversion of any shares of capital stock and exercise of the warrants; provided, however, that such allocation -------- ------- shall not operate to reduce the aggregate number of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares to be included in such registration, if any such holder does not request inclusion of the maximum number of shares of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares allocated to him pursuant to the above-described procedure, the remaining portion of his allocation shall be reallocated among those requesting holders of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares whose allocations did not satisfy their requests pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares which would be held by such holders, assuming conversion of any capital stock and exercise of the warrants, and this procedure shall be repeated until all of the shares of registrable securities and other prior registrable shares which may be included in the registration on behalf of such holders have been so allocated; (ii) second, to the company with respect to shares of cbc common stock being sold for the account of the company, and, subject to the second paragraph of section 1.2(d), among the holders of other subsequent registrable shares requesting inclusion of other subsequent registrable shares, as determined by the company pursuant to such agreements as may exist between the company and holders of other subsequent registrable shares. in connection with the first 1998 requested registration, (i) the company agrees to use reasonable efforts (which shall not require the company to grant any consideration) to request that the holders of other prior registrable shares requesting to be included in any registration pursuant to section 1.2(a) hereof permit the registrable securities requested by apollo to have priority to be included in any such registration in which all registrable securities and other shares requested to be included cannot be so included and (ii) the koll shareholders agree that apollo shall have priority over the koll shareholders other than apollo with respect to the -14- number of registrable securities that may be included in such registration.

agreement this warrant agreement (the "agreement") is made and entered into as of august 28, 1997 between cb commercial real estate services group, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), fs equity partners iii, l.p., fs equity partners international l.p., ap kms partners, l.p., ap kms ii, llc, koll holding company and the individuals listed on the signature pages hereto. whereas, pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of reorganization (the "merger agreement"), dated as of may 14, 1997 by and between the company, koll real estate services ("kres") and the other parties listed therein, kres will be merged with a subsidiary of the company and the holders of shares of common stock of kres and options exercisable into shares of common stock of kres shall receive warrants (the "warrants") to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares (the "warrant shares") of the common stock of the company (the "common stock"). now therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows (capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed thereto in the merger agreement): section 1. exercise of warrant. subject to the terms of this agreement, each holder of a warrant may, at any time on and after august 28, 2000, but not later than august 27, 2004, exercise this warrant in whole at any time or in part from time to time for the number of warrant shares which such holder is then entitled to purchase hereunder. each holder of a warrant may exercise such warrant, in whole or in part by either of the following methods: (a) delivering to the company at its office maintained for such purpose pursuant to section 12(d) (i) a written notice of such holder's election to exercise this warrant, which notice shall specify the number of warrant shares to be purchased, (ii) this warrant and (iii) a sum equal to the exercise price (as set forth in the warrant certificate attached hereto) therefor payable in immediately available funds; or (b) the holder of this warrant may also exercise this warrant, in whole or in part, in a "cashless" or "net-issue" exercise by delivering to the issuer at its office maintained for such purpose pursuant to section 12(d) (i) a written notice of such holder's election to exercise this warrant, which notice shall specify the number of warrant shares to be delivered to such holder and the number of warrant shares with respect to which this warrant is being surrendered in payment of the aggregate exercise price for the warrant shares to be delivered to the holder, and (ii) the warrant. for purposes of this provision, all warrant shares as to which the warrant is surrendered will be attributed a value equal to the product of (x) the current market price per share of common stock (determined in the manner set forth in section 7(f)) minus the current exercise price per share of common stock. such notice may be in the form of election to purchase set out at the end of this warrant agreement. upon delivery thereof, the company shall cause to be executed and delivered to such holder within five business days a certificate or certificates representing the aggregate number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise. the stock certificate or certificates for warrant shares so delivered shall be in such denominations as may be specified in said notice and shall be registered in the name of such holder or such other name or names as shall be designated in said notice. such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and such holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares, including to the extent permitted by law the right to vote such shares or to consent or to receive notice as a stockholder, as of the time said notice is delivered to the issuer as aforesaid. if a warrant shall have been exercised only in part, the company shall, at the time of delivery of said certificate or certificates, deliver 2-1 to such holder a new warrant dated the date it is issued, evidencing the rights of such holder to purchase the remaining warrant shares called for by this warrant, which new warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this warrant, or, at the request of such holder, appropriate notation may be made on this warrant and the warrant shall be returned to such holder. all warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of a warrant shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and other encumbrances thereon, other than liens or other encumbrances created by the holder thereof. the company will not close its books against the transfer of a warrant or of any warrant shares in any manner which interferes with the timely exercise of a warrant. the issuer will from time to time take all such action as may be necessary to assure that the par value per share of the unissued common stock acquirable upon exercise of a warrant is at all times equal to or less than the exercise price then in effect. section 2. transfer, division and combination. the warrants are, and all rights thereunder are, transferable, in whole or in part, on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of a warrant at the office of the company maintained for such purpose pursuant to section 12(d), together with a written assignment of such warrant duly executed by the holder thereof or its agent or attorney and payment of funds sufficient to pay any stock transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the company shall, execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and the surrendered warrant shall promptly be canceled. if and when a warrant is assigned in blank, the company may (but shall not be obligated to) treat the bearer thereof as the absolute owner of such warrant for all purposes and the company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. a warrant, if properly assigned in compliance with this section 2, may be exercised by an assignee for the purchase of shares of common stock without having a new warrant issued. a warrant may, be divided or combined with other warrants upon presentation at the aforesaid office of the company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new warrants are to be issued, signed by the holder hereof or its agent or attorney. subject to compliance with the preceding paragraph, as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or combination, the company shall execute and deliver a new warrant or warrants in exchange for the warrant or warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. the company agrees to maintain at its aforesaid office books for the registration and transfer of the warrants. section 3. payment of taxes. the company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of warrant shares upon the exercise of warrants; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any warrant certificates or any certificates for warrant shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a warrant certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a warrant, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver such warrant certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. section 4. mutilated or missing warrants certificates. in case any of the warrant certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the company may in its discretion issue, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated warrant certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the warrant certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the company of such loss, theft or destruction of such warrant certificate and indemnity, if requested, also satisfactory to them. applicants for such 2-2 substitute warrant certificates shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the company may prescribe. section 5. reservation of warrant shares. the company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued common stock or its authorized and issued common stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue warrant shares upon exercise of warrants, the maximum number of shares of common stock which may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants. the company or, if appointed, the transfer agent for the common stock (the "transfer agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this agreement on file with the transfer agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. the company will furnish such transfer agent a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto transmitted to each holder pursuant to section 10 hereof. section 6. obtaining stock exchange listings. the company will from time to time take all action which may be necessary so that the warrant shares, immediately upon their issuance upon the exercise of warrants, will be listed on the principal securities exchanges and markets within the united states of america (including the nasdaq national market), if any, on which other shares of common stock are then listed. section 7. adjustment of exercise price. the exercise price and the number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this section 7. for purposes of this section 7, "common stock" means shares now or hereafter authorized of any class of common stock of the company and any other stock of the company, however designated, that has the right (subject to any prior rights of any class or series of preferred stock) to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the company without limit as to per share amount. (a) adjustment for change in capital stock. if the company: (1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its common stock; (2) subdivides its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares; (3) combines its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares; (4) makes a distribution on its common stock in shares of its capital stock other than common stock; or (5) issues by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock; then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such action and the number and kind of shares into which a warrant is exercisable shall all be adjusted appropriately so that the holder of any warrant thereafter exercised may receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the company which he would have owned immediately following such action if such warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such action. the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. if after an adjustment a holder of a warrant upon exercise of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the company, the board of directors of the company shall determine the allocation of the 2-3 adjusted exercise price between the classes of capital stock. after such allocation, the exercise privilege and the exercise price of each class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to common stock in this section. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (b) adjustment for rights issue. if the company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of its common stock entitling them for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share on that record date, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: o + n x p ----- e8 = e x m ----- o + n where: e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the current exercise price. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. n = the number of additional shares of common stock offered pursuant to such rights issue. p = the offering price per share of the additional shares. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights, options or warrants. if at the end of the period during which such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the exercise price shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "n" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. (c) adjustment for other distributions. if the company distributes to all holders of its common stock any assets (excluding cash) or debt securities or any rights or warrants to purchase debt securities, assets or other securities, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: e8 = e x m - f ----- m where: e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the current exercise price. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the record date mentioned below. f = the aggregate fair market value on the record date of the assets, securities, rights or warrants divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock on the record date for such distribution. the board of directors of the company shall determine the fair market value. 2-4 the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. (d) adjustment for common stock issue: if the company issues shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price per share on the date the company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: p - e8 = e x o + m ----- a where: e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the then current exercise price. o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such additional shares. m = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such additional shares. a = the number of shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. this subsection (d) does not apply to: (1) any of the transactions described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section 7, (2) the exercise of warrants, or the conversion or exchange of other securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, common stock, (3) common stock issued to the company's employees under bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors and approved by the holders of common stock when required by law, if such common stock would otherwise be covered by this subsection (d), (4) common stock issued upon the exercise of rights or warrants issued to the holders of common stock, (5) common stock issued to shareholders of any person which merges into the company in proportion to their stock holdings of such person immediately prior to such merger, upon such merger, (6) common stock issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, (7) common stock issued in a bona fide private placement to, or through a placement agent which is, a member firm of the national association of securities dealers, inc., or (8) common stock issued as a dividend on any preferred stock in accordance with the stated terms of such preferred stock and in lieu of cash dividends otherwise payable on such preferred stock pursuant to the instrument under which the preferred stock was issued. (e) adjustment for convertible securities issue. if the company issues any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock (other than securities issued in transactions described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section 7) for a 2-5 consideration per share of common stock initially deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities less than the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such securities, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with this formula: p - e8 = e x o + m ----- o + d where: e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the then current exercise price. o = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such securities. p = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such securities. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the date of issuance of such securities. d = the maximum number of shares deliverable upon conversion or in exchange for such securities at the initial conversion or exchange rate. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance. if all of the common stock deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities has not been issued when such securities are no longer outstanding, then the exercise price shall promptly be readjusted to the exercise price which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion or exchange of such securities. this subsection (e) does not apply to: (1) convertible securities issued to shareholders of any person which merges into the company, or with a subsidiary of the company, in proportion to their stock holdings of such person immediately prior to such merger, upon such merger, (2) convertible securities issued in a bona fide public offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, (3) convertible securities issued in a bona fide private placement through a placement agent which is a member firm of the national association of securities dealers, inc., (4) rights, warrants and convertible and exchangeable securities outstanding on or prior to the date of issuance of the warrant, or (5) convertible securities or warrants issued in connection with the incurrence of debt by the company, so long as the fair value allocable to such convertible securities or warrants (taking into account the terms of the debt), together with any consideration payable to the company upon conversion or exercise of such convertible securities or warrants, treating such convertible securities or warrants on an as converted basis, is no less than the then current market price of common stock on the date of issuance of such convertible securities or warrants. (f) current market price. in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section 7 the current market price per share of common stock on any date is the average of the quoted prices of the common stock for 30 consecutive trading days commencing 45 trading days before the date in question. the "quoted price" of the common stock is the last reported sales 2-6 price of the common stock as reported by nasdaq national market, or if the common stock is listed on a securities exchange, the last reported sales price of the common stock on such exchange which shall be for consolidated trading if applicable to such exchange, or if neither so reported or listed, the last reported bid price of the common stock. in the absence of one or more such quotations, the board of directors of the company shall determine the current market price on the basis of such quotations or other valuation information as it in good faith considers appropriate. (g) consideration received. for purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section 7, the following shall apply: (1) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions, discounts or other expenses incurred by the company for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith; (2) in the case of the issuance of shares of common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors (irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof), whose determination shall be conclusive; and (3) in the case of the issuance of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares, the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the company for the issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof (the consideration in each case to be determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection). (h) when de minimis adjustment may be deferred. no adjustment in the exercise price need be made unless the adjustment would require on increase or decrease of at least 1% in the exercise price. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section shall be made to the nearest cent or nearest 1/100th of a share as the case may be. (i) when no adjustment required. no adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section 7 if warrant holders are permitted to participate in the transaction (without being required to exercise their warrants in order to do so) on a basis and with notice that the board of directors of the company determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of common stock participate in the transaction. no adjustment need be made for rights to purchase common stock pursuant to a company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the common stock. to the extent the warrants become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. interest will not accrue on the cash. 2-7 (j) notice of adjustment. whenever the exercise price is adjusted, the company shall provide the notices required by section 10 hereof. (k) voluntary reduction. the company from time to time may reduce the exercise price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period; provided, however, that in no event may the exercise price be less than the par value of a share of common stock. whenever the exercise price is reduced, the company shall mail to warrant holders a notice of the reduction. the company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced exercise price takes effect. the notice shall state the reduced exercise price and the period it will be in effect. a reduction of the exercise price pursuant to this clause (k) does not change or adjust the exercise price otherwise in effect for purposes of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section 7. (l) reorganization of company. if the company consolidates or merges with or into, or sells, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its assets to, any person, upon consummation of such transaction the warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the holder of a warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease if the holder had exercised the warrant immediately before the effective date of the transaction. concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the corporation formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger, if other than the company, or the person to which such transfer, sale or lease shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental warrant agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this section. the successor company shall mail to warrant holders a notice describing the supplemental warrant agreement. if the issuer of securities deliverable upon exercise of warrants under the supplemental warrant agreement is an affiliate of the formed, surviving, transferee or lessee corporation, that issuer shall join in the supplemental warrant agreement. if this subsection (l) applies, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section 7 do not apply. (m) determinations conclusive. any determination that the company or the board of directors of the company must make pursuant to subsection (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (i) of this section 7 is conclusive, provided the board of directors has acted reasonably.

provided, however, that the company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional warrant shares, other capital stock and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. 2-8 (o) adjustment in number of shares. upon each adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to this section 7, each warrant outstanding prior to the making of the adjustment in the exercise price shall thereafter evidence the right to receive upon payment of the adjusted exercise price that number of shares of common stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth) obtained from the following formula: n' = n x e --- e' where: n' = the adjusted number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant by payment of the adjusted exercise price. n = the number of warrant shares previously issuable upon exercise of a warrant by payment of the exercise price prior to adjustment. e' = the adjusted exercise price. e = the exercise price prior to adjustment. section 8. forfeiture of warrants. the warrants issued in respect of options to purchase kres common stock are subject to forfeiture as set forth in section 10.12(c) of the merger agreement, if the option(s) to purchase kres common stock in respect of which such warrant is issued expire or terminate without being exercised. upon the termination of any such option all such warrants issued in respect thereof shall be forfeit and the holder thereof shall immediately surrender the warrant certificate representing such warrants to the company. if the warrant certificate so surrendered to the company represents other warrants in addition to those forfeited, the company shall promptly issue a new warrant certificate to the holder thereof representing the number of warrants represented by such warrant certificate and not forfeited. section 9. fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, except for the provisions of this section 9 be issuable on the exercise of any warrants (or specified portion thereof), the company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the current exercise price, multiplied by such fraction. section 10. notices to warrant holders. upon any adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to section 7, the company shall promptly thereafter cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the warrant certificates at its address appearing on the warrant register written notice of such adjustment by first-class mail, postage prepaid. where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this section 7. in case: (a) the company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of shares of common stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or of any other subscription rights or warrants;
