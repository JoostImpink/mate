ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; &#149; block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; &#149; purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; &#149; an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; &#149; privately negotiated transactions; &#149; short sales; &#149; broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; &#149; a combination of any such methods of sale; and &#149; any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. the selling stockholders may also sell shares under rule 144 under the securities act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. the selling stockholders may also engage in short sales against the box, puts and calls and other transactions in our securities or derivatives of our securities and may sell or deliver shares in connection with these trades. broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. the selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. any profits on the resale of shares of common stock by a broker-dealer acting as principal might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the securities act. discounts, concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares will be borne by a selling stockholder. the selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares if liabilities are imposed on that person under the securities act. the selling stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus under rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the securities act of 1933 amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. the selling stockholders also may transfer the shares of common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus and may sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus under rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the securities act of 1933 amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. the selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares of common stock may be deemed to be &#147;underwriters&#148; within the meaning of the securities act in connection with such sales. in such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares of common stock purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the securities act. we are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares of common stock, including up to $30,000 in fees and disbursements of counsel to the selling stockholders. we have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the securities act. the selling stockholders have advised us that they have not entered into any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of their shares of common stock, nor is there an underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with a proposed sale of shares of common stock by any selling stockholder. if we are notified by any selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares of common stock, if required, we will file a supplement to this prospectus. if the selling stockholders use this prospectus for any sale of the shares of common stock, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act. the anti-manipulation rules of regulation m under the securities exchange act of 1934 may apply to sales of our common stock and activities of the selling stockholders. ex-99.3 4 g03490exv99w3.htm ex-99.3 escrow agreement ex-99.3 escrow agreement exhibit 3 escrow agreement this escrow agreement (this &#147;agreement" ) is made and entered into as of july 5, 2006, by and among sirion therapeutics, inc. , a north carolina corporation ( &#147;sirion&#148;
