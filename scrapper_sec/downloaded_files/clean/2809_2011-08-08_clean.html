swing line advances are available by way of incurring overdrafts in the borrower&#146;s canadian dollar and us dollar accounts with the swing line lender, with overdrafts in canadian dollars being deemed to be prime rate advances and overdrafts in us dollars being deemed to be us base rate advances. 3.5.2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the swing line lender shall ascertain the net position of the borrower&#146;s accounts at the close of business daily.&#160; if the net canadian dollar position is a debit in favour of the swing line lender, the debit will be deemed to be a prime rate advance in the amount of the debit under the swing line loan.&#160; if the net us dollar position is a debit in favour of the swing line lender, the debit will be deemed to be a us base rate advance in the amount of the debit under the swing line loan.&#160; if a net position is a credit in favour of the borrower, the credit will be deemed to be a repayment of the swing line advance by a prime rate advance or us base rate advance under the swing line loan, as the case may be, in the amount of the credit to the extent of any principal amounts owing in respect thereof. if, at any time, the aggregate of the swing line advances exceeds us$30,000,000 or the equivalent in canadian dollars, such excess shall be immediately repaid by the borrower.&#160; no repayments of any swing line advance shall be deemed to be a permanent reduction in the credit facility. 3.5.3 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; all interest payments and principal repayments of or in respect of the swing line loan shall be solely for the account of the swing line lender. 3.5.4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained or contrary to the provisions of applicable law, if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or if any swing line loan is outstanding on the last day of each month, the borrower shall be deemed to have made a request for, as applicable, a prime rate advance and/or a us base rate advance, and each lender shall make, as applicable, a prime rate advance and/or a us base rate advance available to the agent for the purpose of repaying the principal amount of the portion of the swing line loan owed to the swing line lender, in the amount of such lender&#146;s applicable percentage multiplied by the amount of the outstanding principal of the swing line loan owing to the swing line lender. each lender&#146;s obligation to fund a prime rate advance or us base rate advance as aforesaid shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a) any set-off, compensation, counterclaim, recoupment, defence or 51 other right which such lender may have against any swing line lender, the borrower, any other obligor or any other person for any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of any default or event of default, (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the borrower, any other obligor or any other person, (d) any breach of this agreement by the borrower or any other person, (e) any inability of the borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in this agreement on any applicable drawdown date for such prime rate advance or us base rate advance or participating interest to be purchased, or (f) any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 3.5.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; if the swing line lender no longer wishes to act as such, it shall notify the borrower, the other lenders and the agent not less than 15 days prior to the date on which it proposes to cease acting as the swing line lender.&#160; in such event, the agent, in consultation with the borrower, may designate another lender as the swing line lender by sending a notice to (a) the swing line lender who will no longer act as such (the &#147; retiring swing line lender &#148;) and (b) the proposed new swing line lender who has agreed to act as such, not less than five days prior to the date on which the replacement is to occur. the new swing line lender shall make, as necessary, a prime rate advance and/or a us base rate advance available to the agent for the purpose of repaying the portion of the swing line loan owed to the retiring swing line lender. 3.5.6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; if, following the sending of such notice by the agent, an event of default has occurred, other than an event of default under subsection 15.1.11, or if no lender has agreed to act as a replacement for the retiring swing line lender (in such case, the swing line lender is herein referred to as the &#147; former swing line lender &#148;), the borrower shall be deemed to have made a request for, as necessary, a prime rate advance and/or a us base rate advance, and each lender shall make, as necessary, a prime rate advance and/or a us base rate advance available to the agent for the purpose of repaying the principal amount of the portion of the swing line loan owed to the former swing line lender, in the amount of such lender&#146;s applicable percentage multiplied by the amount of the principal of the outstanding swing line loan owing to the former swing line lender (the &#147; lender swing line repayments &#148;).&#160; in such event, the borrower&#146;s right to obtain swing line advances will cease and the amounts outstanding thereunder will continue to form part of the loan obligations.&#160; however, if a default under subsection 15.1.11 of this agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, or if an event of default under subsection 15.1.11 shall have occurred, the lenders shall not make 52 such lender swing line repayments and the provisions of subsection 3.5.7 shall apply. 3.5.7 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

in such event, the borrower&#146;s right to obtain swing line advances will cease and the amounts outstanding thereunder will continue to form part of the loan obligations.&#160; if at any time after any lender swing line repayment has been made or any participation in any existing swing line loan has been purchased in accordance with this section 3.5.7, the former swing line lender receives any payment on account of the principal of the swing line loan in respect of which such lender swing line repayment has been made or any participation in any existing swing line loan has been purchased in accordance with this section 3.5.7, the former swing line lender will distribute to the agent for the benefit of each lender an amount equal to its percentage commitment multiplied by such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such lender&#146;s portion was outstanding and funded) in like funds as received; provided, however, that if such payment received by the former swing line lender is required to be returned, such lender will return to the agent for the benefit of the former swing line lender any portion thereof previously distributed by the former swing line lender to the agent for the benefit of such lender in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by such former swing line lender. 3.5.8 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

if any lender does not make available the amount required under subsection 3.5.6 or 3.5.7, as the case may be, the former swing line lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such lender, together with interest thereon, as applicable, at the prime rate basis or us base rate basis, as applicable, at such time from the date of non-payment until such amount is paid in full. 3.6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

notwithstanding subsection 3.4.2.1, in the case of clause (ii) above, no letters of credit fee shall be payable on the portion of the letters of credit for which the borrower has entered into those arrangements with the issuing lender, with the result that the letters of credit fee shall, in such case, be reduced by that amount. 3.6.3 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the borrower authorizes the lenders, or any of them, to debit its accounts with the amount required to pay such letters of credit and to pay such bankers&#146; acceptances, notwithstanding that such bankers&#146; acceptances may be held by the lenders, or any of them, in their own right at maturity.&#160; such amounts paid to, or obtained by, the agent in respect of bankers&#146; acceptances and letters of credit shall be applied against, and shall reduce, pro rata among the lenders, to the extent of the amounts paid to, or obtained by, the agent in respect of bankers&#146; acceptances and letters of credit, respectively, the obligations of the borrower to pay amounts then or thereafter payable under bankers&#146; acceptances and letters of credit, respectively, at the times amounts become payable thereunder.&#160;

the balance of such proceeds may be held by the agent and, when the agent decides it is opportune, may be applied to the account of the part of the loan obligations of the borrower to the lenders which the agent deems preferable, without prejudice to the rights of the lenders against the borrower for any loss of profit. 15.6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this agreement.&#160; as to any matters not expressly provided for by this agreement, the agent shall act hereunder or in connection herewith in accordance with the instructions of the lenders in accordance with the provisions of this article, but in the absence of any such instructions, the agent may (but 99 shall not be obliged to) act as it shall deem fit in the best interests of the lenders, and any such instructions and any action taken by the agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon each lender.&#160; the agent and its related parties shall not, by reason of this agreement, be deemed to be a trustee or fiduciary for the benefit of any lender, any obligor or any other person, irrespective of whether a default or event of default may have occurred.&#160; neither the agent nor any of its related parties shall be responsible to the lenders for (a) any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this agreement or any other loan document or in any certificate or other document referred to, or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this agreement, (b) the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this agreement or any other loan document or any collateral provided for thereby, (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in this agreement, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the agent or (d) any failure by the borrower or any other obligor to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other loan documents.&#160; the agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other loan document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the agent from among the lenders (including the person serving as agent) and their respective affiliates.&#160;

the agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.&#160; in determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a lender or the issuing lender, the agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such lender or the issuing lender unless the agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such lender or the issuing lender prior to the making of such advance.&#160; the agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken 100 by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.&#160; the agent may deem and treat each lender as the holder of the commitment made by such lender for all purposes hereof unless and until an assignment has been completed in accordance with section 18.2. 16.2.2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a default or event of default unless the agent has received notice from a lender or the borrower describing such a default or event of default and stating that such notice is a &#147; notice of default &#148;.&#160; in the event that the agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a default or event of default or otherwise becomes aware that a default or event of default has occurred, the agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the lenders.&#160; the agent shall take such action with respect to such default or event of default as shall be reasonably directed by the lenders in accordance with the provisions of this article provided that, unless and until the agent shall have received such directions, the agent may (but shall not be obliged to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such a default or event of default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the lenders.&#160; the agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose the agent to liability or that is contrary to any loan document or applicable law. 16.2.3 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

nothing in this agreement shall oblige the agent to disclose any information relating to the obligors if such disclosure would or might, in the opinion of the agent, constitute a breach of any applicable law or duty of secrecy or confidence. 16.2.4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the agent shall have no responsibility (a) to any obligor on account of the failure of any lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other loan document or (b) to any lender on account of the failure of any obligor to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other loan document. 16.2.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; each lender severally represents and warrants to the agent that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the obligors in connection with the making and continuation of its commitment and has not relied on any information provided to such lender by the agent in connection herewith, and each lender 101 represents and warrants to the agent that it shall continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of the obligors while any loan obligations are outstanding or the lenders have any obligations hereunder. 16.3 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; rights of agent as lender with respect to its commitment, the agent in its capacity as a lender shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the agent.&#160;

in acting as agent, the agency department will be treated as a separate entity from any other department or division of the lender in question.&#160; without limiting the foregoing, the agent shall not be deemed to have notice of a document or information received by any other department or division of that lender, nor will the lender concerned be deemed to have notice of a document or information received by the agent. 16.4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; indemnity by lenders each lender shall indemnify the agent and hold it harmless, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the borrower or another obligor, rateably in accordance with its applicable percentage and not jointly or jointly and severally, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever (including the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the agent in any way relating to or arising out of this agreement or any other loan documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (excluding, unless a default or event of default is apprehended or has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incidental to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any other loan documents, provided that no lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the agent&#146;s gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 16.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notice by agent to lenders as soon as practicable after its receipt thereof, the agent will forward to each lender a copy of each report, notice or other document required by this agreement to be delivered to the agent for such lender. 102 16.6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; protection of agent - advances and payments 16.6.1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; unless the agent shall have been notified in writing by any lender prior to a drawdown date that such lender does not intend to make available to the agent such lender&#146;s applicable percentage of such advance, the agent may assume that such lender has made such lender&#146;s applicable percentage of such advance available to the agent on the drawdown date and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the borrower a corresponding amount.&#160; if such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the agent by such lender, the agent shall be entitled to recover such amount (together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the agent as being its applicable rate for interbank compensation based on prevailing banking industry standards) on demand from such lender or, if such lender fails to reimburse the agent for such amount on demand, from the borrower. 16.6.2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; unless the agent shall have been notified in writing by the borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that the borrower does not intend to make such payment, the agent may assume that the borrower will make such payment when due and the agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each lender on such payment date an amount equal to such lender&#146;s pro rata share of such assumed payment.&#160; if it is established that the borrower has not in fact made such payment to the agent, each lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the agent the amount made available to such lender (together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the agent as being its applicable rate for interbank compensation based on prevailing banking industry standards). 16.7 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notice by lenders to agent each lender shall endeavour to use its best efforts to notify the agent of the occurrence of any default or event of default forthwith upon becoming aware of such event, but no lender shall be liable if it fails to give such notice to the agent. 16.8 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

following any loan obligations becoming due and payable under section 15.2, shall be shared by each supported party, pro rata , based on its percentage of the aggregate supported obligations; and each lender undertakes to do all such things as may be reasonably required to give full effect to this section 16.8.&#160; if any amount so shared is later recovered from the lender who originally received it, each other lender shall restore its proportionate share of such amount to such lender, without interest. as a necessary consequence of the foregoing, each lender shall share, in a percentage equal to its applicable percentage, any losses incurred as a result of any event of default, and shall pay to the agent, within 2 business days following a request by the agent, any amount required to ensure that such lender bears its applicable percentage of such losses, if any, including any amounts required to be paid to any lender in respect of any bankers&#146; acceptances and letters of credit.&#160; such obligation to share losses shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (a) any set-off, compensation, counterclaim, recoupment, defence or other right which such lender may have against the agent, any obligor or any other person for any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of any default or event of default, (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the borrower or any other person, (d) any breach of this agreement by the borrower or any other person, or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.&#160; where necessary to give effect to this section 16.8, a lender shall purchase a participation in the advances of other lenders.&#160; if any lender does not make available the amount required hereunder, the agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such lender, together with interest thereon at the rate determined by the agent as being its applicable rate for interbank compensation based on prevailing banking industry standards from the date of non payment until such amount is paid in full. the provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to (a) any payment obtained by a lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its loan obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to any obligor or any affiliate of an obligor (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply), (b) any payment made while no event of default has occurred and is continuing in respect of obligations of the borrower to such lender that do not arise under or in connection with the loan documents, (c) any payment made in respect of an obligation that is secured by a permitted lien or that is otherwise entitled to priority over any obligor&#146;s obligations under or in connection with the loan documents, (d) any reduction arising from an amount owing to an obligor on account of derivative obligations upon the termination of any derivative instrument except for a net amount available after the termination of all derivative obligations between the obligors and such lender (or an affiliate of a lender) and the set-off of resulting amounts owing by the obligors and to the obligors, 104 or (e) any payment to which such lender is entitled as a result of any form of credit insurance obtained by such lender. 16.9 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

subject to the applicable provisions of this agreement, each lender shall disburse its applicable percentage of each advance, and shall make it available to the agent (no later than 10:00 a.m.) on the drawdown date, by depositing its applicable percentage of the advance in the agent&#146;s account in the applicable currency, as the case may be.&#160; the agent will make such amounts available to the borrower on the drawdown date, at the branch, and, in the absence of other arrangements made in writing between the agent and the borrower, by transferring or causing to be transferred an equivalent amount in the case of a prime rate advance, us base rate advance, libor advance and the available proceeds in the case of bankers&#146; acceptances, in accordance with the instructions of the borrower which appear in the notice of borrowing with respect to each advance; however, the obligation of the agent with respect hereto is limited to taking the steps judged commercially reasonable in order to follow such instructions, and once undertaken, such steps shall constitute prima facie evidence that the amounts have been disbursed in accordance with the applicable provisions.&#160; subject to the foregoing sentence, the agent shall not be liable for damages, claims or costs imputed to the borrower and resulting from the fact that the amount of an advance did not arrive at its agreed-upon destination. 16.10 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the agent in its discretion. 16.11 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; accounts kept by each lender each lender shall keep in its books, in respect of its commitment, accounts for libor advances, prime rate advances, us base rate advances, bankers&#146; acceptances and other amounts payable by the borrower under this agreement.&#160; each lender shall make appropriate entries showing, as debits, the amount of the debt of the borrower to it in respect of the libor advances, prime rate advances, us base rate advances and ba advances, as the case may be, the amount of all accrued interest and any other 105 amount due to such lender pursuant hereto and, as credits, each payment or repayment of principal and interest made in respect of such debt as well as any other amount paid to such lender pursuant hereto.&#160; these accounts shall constitute (in the absence of contradictory entries in the accounts of the agent referred to in section 3.7) prima facie evidence of their content against the borrower. 16.12 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; binding determinations the agent shall in good faith to make any determination that is required in order to apply this agreement and, once made, such determination shall be final and binding upon all lenders, except in the case of manifest error. 16.13 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

authorized waivers, variations and omissions if so authorized in writing by the lenders, the agent, on behalf of the lenders, may grant waivers, consents, vary the terms of this agreement and the other loan documents and do or omit to do all acts and things in connection herewith or therewith.&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, except with the prior written agreement of each lender, nothing in section 15.6, section 16.14 or this section 16.15 shall authorize (a) any extension of the date for, or alteration in the amount, currency or mode of calculation or computation of any payment of principal or interest, fees or other amounts, with the effect, in the case of the alteration in the amount or mode of calculation or computation or any payment of 106 principal or interest, fees or other amounts, that any such principal, interest, fees or other amounts would be reduced, (b) any reduction in the interest rate applicable to the payment of principal, fees or other amounts, (c) any increase in the commitment of a lender, (d) any extension of any maturity date (other than as set out in section 2.5), (e) any change in the terms of this article 16, (f) any change in the manner of making decisions among the lenders, including the definition of majority lenders, (g) the release of the obligations of any obligor except to the extent permitted by section 8.2.2 or section 14.9, (h) the release, in whole or in part, of any of the loan documents or of any of the guarantees, (i) any change in or any waiver of the conditions precedent provided for in section 9.1 or (j) any amendment to this section 16.15. 16.16 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
