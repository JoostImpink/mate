first note &#148;) convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.04 per share (subject to equitable adjustments), and (b) subject to the conditions precedent specified therein, (i) the issuance to velocitas at the second closing (the &#147;

series b offering &#148;). if the gross proceeds from the series b offering were less than $4,000,000 (with such deficit being referred to as the &#147; proceeds gap &#148;), the issuer would be obligated to seek capital, in an amount at least equal to the proceeds gap, from third parties in a private placement over the following 180 days. velocitas negotiated with the issuer to establish the $0.04 per share price for the shares of common stock underlying the series b preferred stock. after this price negotiation was completed, bradley sacks, the chairman of the board of directors of the issuer (&#147; b sacks &#148;), was requested to provide a backstop for the series b offering to ensure that the issuer raised sufficient capital to effect its current business plan. if the issuer was unable to raise additional capital at least equal to the proceeds gap from third parties, pursuant to the backstop agreement between b sacks, velocitas and the issuer, dated as of february 27, 2017 (the &#147; backstop agreement &#148;), b sacks had agreed that he or his affiliates would purchase up to $2.0 million worth of common stock, as determined by the issuer, at a purchase price of $0.04 per share (equal to the as-converted-to common stock price to be paid by velocitas or its affiliates for the series b preferred stock). as required by the purchase agreement, upon the first closing, v. shah was appointed to the board of directors of the issuer and designated as the issuer&#146;s chief executive officer. additionally, as a condition of the first closing, helmut kerschbaumer, the issuer&#146;s interim president, chief executive officer and director, as well as klaus kuehne, a member of the issuer&#146;s board of directors, resigned. in connection with the execution of the velocitas purchase agreement, b sacks, centric capital ventures llc, a delaware limited liability company (&#147; centric capital &#148;), michael i. sacks (&#147; m sacks &#148;), velocitas, velocitas i, terrance k. wallberg (&#147; wallberg &#148;) and the issuer entered into a voting agreement, dated as of february 27, 2017 (the &#147; voting agreement &#148;), which became effective on march 31, 2017 at the second closing. pursuant to the voting agreement, the parties agreed that once the voting agreement became effective, the size of the board of directors would be set at six directors, and the parties would vote for the election to the board of directors of four persons designated by velocitas (initially to be a. shah, tiedt, v. shah and arindam bose), one director designated by b sacks and one additional director designated by a major investor or by the board of directors. in addition, the voting agreement provides for a vote in favor of a proposal to amend the issuer&#146;s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the &#147; articles &#148;) to increase the authorized shares as required to permit the conversion of the series b preferred stock. the purchasers of series b preferred stock became parties to the voting agreement at the second closing. in connection with the second closing, the voting agreement was amended to release mr. walberg from the voting agreement and any obligations thereunder. pursuant to the second closing, velocitas received the second note and the warrant. in connection with the second closing, the parties to the velocitas purchase agreement entered into an amendment (the &#147; amendment &#148;) to the velocitas purchase agreement (the purchase agreement, as so amended, the &#147; amended purchase agreement &#148;), pursuant to which wallberg was removed as a party to the amended purchase agreement. in connection with the second closing, velocitas i purchased $5,000,000 of series b preferred stock. the as-converted-to-common-stock purchase price for the series b preferred stock is $0.04 per share. because the gross proceeds exceeded $4,000,000, there was no proceeds gap and the issuer is not obligated to seek capital from third parties in a private placement. additionally, the backstop agreement expired without the parties thereto being required to purchase any shares of common stock. also, in connection with the second closing, the altrazeal distributor agreements were acquired by the issuer from velocitas in exchange for the altrazeal distributor shares. schedule 13d cusip no. 90403t209 as required by the amended purchase agreement, at the second closing, the issuer appointed a. shah and tiedt to serve as part of the issuer&#146;s executive management team and, together with arindam bose, to also join the issuer&#146;s board of directors. each of a. shah, tiedt, and arindam bose are affiliates of velocitas and were appointed pursuant to the voting agreement. concurrent with the second closing and as a condition of the series b offering, the issuer received resignation notices from robert f. goldrich and wallberg, each being a member of the issuer&#146;s board of directors. wallberg will continue to serve as the issuer&#146;s vice president, chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer. at the second closing, b sacks also stepped down as chairman of the board of directors and v. shah, the issuer&#146;s chief executive officer and director, assumed the role chairman of the board of directors. b sacks will continue to serve as a director of the issuer. in addition, the issuer, velocitas, b sacks and certain other parties entered into an investor rights agreement, dated as of february 27, 2017 (the &#147;
