(e) not applicable. &#160; item 6.&#160;&#160;contracts, arrangement, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. &#160; the information set forth in items 2, 3, 4 and 5 is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; warrants &#160; pursuant to the funding agreement, the issuer issued the oak hill funds warrants to acquire common stock and, in some cases, the issuer&#8217;s series a preferred stock, which included, among other provisions, the following terms: &#160; number of shares and exercise price. the warrants are exercisable to purchase in aggregate 8,695,652 shares of common stock, subject to certain adjustments, representing approximately 21.1% of the issuer&#8217;s outstanding equity interest assuming the full exercise of the warrants issued to the oak hill funds and that other holders of warrants do not exercise their warrants. the exercise price for the warrant is $5.75 per share of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. &#160; exercisability. the oak hill funds or their permitted transferees may exercise their warrants for the issuer&#8217;s common stock, provided that in no event shall the oak hill funds or a permitted transferee receive common stock upon the exercise of their warrants to the extent that ownership of such shares would cause the oak hill funds or such permitted transferee to be deemed to &#8220;control&#8221; the issuer or any of its subsidiaries under applicable regulations.&#160;&#160;if any delivery of common stock otherwise deliverable to the oak hill funds or such permitted transferee pursuant to a valid exercise of their warrants is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of the restriction described in the previous sentence, the issuer will be obligated to satisfy a portion of the oak hill funds&#8217; or such permitted transferee&#8217;s exercise with shares of the issuer&#8217;s series a preferred stock. &#160; the oak hill funds may also exercise all or any part of their warrants for a number of shares of series a preferred stock that will be convertible (in the hands of a non-affiliate of the oak hill funds that acquires such series a preferred stock in a widely distributed offering) into the number of shares of common stock that the oak hill funds would otherwise be entitled to receive upon exercise of their warrants. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; expiration. the warrants are exercisable in whole or in part from time to time until the fifth anniversary of the issuance date but will expire to the extent that the issuer makes permitted prepayments on the loans and the holders do not promptly exercise a corresponding portion of the warrants. &#160; voting rights. prior to the exercise of their warrants, the oak hill funds, in their capacity as warrantholders, are not entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the issuer by virtue of their warrants, including the right to vote or to consent with respect to any matter. &#160; transferability of warrants. the oak hill funds may transfer or assign their warrants (a)&#160;to any affiliate controlling, controlled by or under common control, in whole or in part without the consent of the issuer or (b)&#160;to any non-affiliate, in whole or in part, with the consent of the issuer, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. &#160; adjustment in the exercise price and number of shares. the warrants are subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments for actions that would have a dilutive effect on the oak hill funds&#8217; ownership stake.&#160;&#160;these adjustments would occur in connection with (i) the issuer&#8217;s common stock being issued at less than 90% of the common stock&#8217;s market price; (ii) stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations; (iii) other types of distributions, such as of assets, cash or evidence of indebtedness; (iv) certain repurchases of common stock and (v) business combinations. &#160; investors rights agreement &#160;

board representation .&#160;&#160;the oak hill funds are entitled to designate an individual to serve on the board of directors of the issuer (the &#8220;board of directors&#8221;).&#160;&#160;in connection therewith, j. taylor crandall was appointed as the oak hill fund&#8217;s representative to the board of directors effective as of july 29, 2011.&#160;&#160;the oak hill funds are entitled to nominate a representative on the board of directors for so long as the oak hill funds and their affiliates own at least 9.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock (subject to certain adjustments).&#160;&#160;additionally, the oak hill funds are also entitled to designate one nonvoting board observer to the board of directors so long as the oak hill funds own at least 4.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock (subject to certain adjustments). &#160; registration rights . the issuer has granted the oak hill funds customary registration rights, including &#8220;shelf&#8221; registration rights, demand registration rights and &#8220;piggy-back&#8221; registration rights with respect to common stock purchased under the warrants.&#160;&#160;pursuant to such registration rights, the issuer has agreed to prepare and file with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering (or, if permitted by securities laws, otherwise designate an existing shelf registration statement to cover) all registrable securities (as defined in the investors rights agreement) as promptly as practicable after (and in any event no more than ninety (90) days after) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the funding agreement and use all reasonable best efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to be declared or be deemed effective. &#160; preemptive rights . so long as the oak hill funds owns securities of the issuer representing 4.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock (before giving effect to any issuances triggered by such preemptive rights), if the issuer at any time makes any public or non-public offering or sale of any equity (including common stock, preferred stock and restricted stock), or any securities, options or debt that is convertible or exchangeable into equity or that include an equity component (any such security, a &#8220;new security&#8221;) (other than the issuance and sale of securities to directors, members of management, or employees of the issuer or issuer&#8217;s subsidiaries or in connection with dividend reinvestment plans, in each case in the ordinary course of the issuer&#8217;s business consistent with past practice and solely for compensation purposes), the oak hill funds shall first be afforded the opportunity to acquire from the issuer for the same price and on the same terms (except that, the oak hill funds may elect to receive such securities in nonvoting form, convertible into shares of voting securities in a widely dispersed offering) as such securities are proposed to be offered to others, up to the amount of such new securities to be offered in the aggregate required to enable the oak hill funds to maintain their proportionate equivalent interest in the common stock immediately prior to any such issuance of new securities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; rebuttal of control &#160; in connection with the funding agreement, the oak hill funds made certain commitments to the office of thrift supervision to ensure that none of the oak hill funds or any of their affiliates will, among other things, exercise or attempt to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries for purposes of the home owners&#8217; loan act of 1933, as amended.&#160; &#160; the foregoing descriptions of the warrants and the investor rights agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, the full text of the warrants and the investors rights agreement, which are included as exhibits 99.4, 99.5 and 99.6 hereto and are each incorporated by reference to this item 6. &#160;
