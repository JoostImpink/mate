(c) nothing in this section 3 will create any liability on the part of parent to stockholder if parent for any reason should decide not to file a registration statement proposed to be filed under section 3(a) or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that stockholder may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance by parent of any notice hereunder or otherwise. (d) a request by stockholder to include registrable securities in a proposed underwritten offering pursuant to section 3(a) will not be deemed to be a request for a demand registration pursuant to section 4. 4. demand registration rights. (a) upon the written request by stockholder at any time commencing on the closing date and continuing through the effective period that parent effect the registration with the sec under and in accordance with the provisions of the securities act of all or part of stockholder's registrable securities (which written request will specify the aggregate number of shares of registrable securities requested to be registered, the form of registration statement to be used, with parent's reasonable consent, and the means of distribution), parent will file a registration statement covering stockholder's registrable securities requested to be registered within 20 business days after receipt of such request; provided, however, that parent will not be required to take any action pursuant to this section 4: (i) if prior to the date of such request parent shall have effected two registrations pursuant to this section 4; 4 (ii) if parent has effected a registration pursuant to section 3 within the 90-day period next preceding such request which permitted stockholder to register all of its registrable securities; (iii) if parent shall at the time have effective a shelf registration pursuant to which stockholder could effect the disposition of all of the stockholder's registrable securities in the manner requested; (iv) if the registrable securities which parent shall have been requested to register shall have a then-current market value of less than $50,000,000, unless such registration request is for all remaining registrable securities; or (v) during the pendency of any blackout period.

(d) stockholder may, at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating to such registration, revoke such request by providing a written notice to parent revoking such request. in such event, stockholder will reimburse parent for all its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing and processing of the registration statement; provided, however, that, if such revocation was based on (i) parent's failure to comply in any material respect with its obligations hereunder or (ii) the occurrence of a blackout period, such reimbursement will not be required. (e) parent will not include any securities which are not registrable securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to a demand made under this section 4 without the prior written consent of stockholder. 5. selection of underwriters. in connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to a demand made under section 4, stockholder will have the right to propose a managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering, which parent may in its sole discretion reject, in which case the managing underwriter or underwriters 5 shall be selected by stockholder from a list of six nationally prominent underwriters selected by parent in its sole discretion. 6. blackout periods.

(b) if the board of directors of parent determines in good faith that the registration and distribution of registrable securities (i) would materially impede, delay or interfere with any pending financing (other than a financing of the type described in section 6(a)), acquisition, corporate reorganization or other significant transaction involving parent or (ii) would require disclosure of non-public material information, the disclosure of which would materially and adversely affect parent, and, in the case of clause (ii), parent is concurrently forbidding purchases or sales in the open market by senior executives of parent, parent will promptly give the stockholder written notice of such determination and will be entitled to postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 120 calendar days (a "section 6(b) period"); provided, however, that in connection therewith parent will be required to deliver to counsel to stockholder (as identified at such time to the company) a general statement, signed by an officer of parent and accompanied by a 6 board resolution, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such postponement or restriction on use and an estimate of the anticipated delay. parent will promptly notify stockholder of the expiration or earlier termination of a section 6(b) period.

(b) prepare and file with the sec amendments and post-effective amendments to such registration statement and such amendments to the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of such registration or as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by parent or by the securities act or rules and regulations thereunder necessary to keep such registration statement effective for up to 90 calendar days, in the case of an underwritten offering, or 360 calendar days, in any other case including a shelf registration (or longer period in the event of a registration hold period during such 90 or 360 calendar days, as provided in this section 7) and cause the prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to rule 424 under the securities act, and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement until the earlier of (i) such 90th or 360th calendar day (or longer period) and (ii) such time as all registrable securities covered by such registration statement have ceased to be registrable securities;

(b) indemnification by stockholder. in connection with the registration statement, stockholder will furnish to parent in writing such information, including the name and address of, and the amount of registrable securities held by, stockholder, as parent reasonably requests for use in such registration statement or the related prospectus and will indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 10(a)) parent or any underwriter, as the case may be, and any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, agents, trustees and controlling persons (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from (i) any violation by stockholder (or its officers, directors, agents, trustees or controlling persons) of any federal or state law, rule or regulation relating to action required of or inaction by 13 stockholder (or such other person) in connection with its offer and sale of registrable securities and (ii) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in, such registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement to either of them or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances then existing) not misleading, but only to the extent that any such untrue statement or omission is made in reliance on and in conformity with information with respect to stockholder furnished in writing to parent by stockholder or its counsel specifically for inclusion therein. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party after the receipt by such indemnified party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement (provided that failure to give such notification will not affect the obligations of the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 10 except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure). in case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who may not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under these indemnification provisions for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest is likely to exist, based on the written opinion of counsel, between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party will be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel. no indemnifying party, in defense of any such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, may, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or entry into any settlement (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the extent the same is covered by the indemnity obligation set forth in this section 10. no indemnified party 14 may consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of each indemnifying party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). (d) contribution. if the indemnification from the indemnifying party provided for in this section 10 is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 10(c), any legal and other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 10(d), no underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the registrable securities underwritten by it. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. stockholder's obligation to contribute is several in the proportion that the proceeds of the offering received by stockholder bears to the total proceeds of the offering, and not joint. if indemnification is available under this section 10(d), the indemnifying parties will indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in section 10(a) or 10(b), as the case may be, without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying parties or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 10(d). (e) certain limitations. in no event will stockholder be liable or required to contribute any amount under this section 10 or otherwise in respect of any untrue or alleged 15 untrue statement or omission or alleged omission for amounts in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of stockholder were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission. (f) nonexclusivity. the provisions of this section 10 will be in addition to any liability which any indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party and will survive the termination of this agreement. (g) underwriter indemnification. notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the indemnification for an underwriter will be modified (to the extent requested by the underwriter) to conform to that which is customary for such underwriter, to the extent set forth in their underwriting agreement. 11. participation in underwritten offerings. stockholder may not participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to section 3 hereunder unless stockholder (a) agrees to sell stockholder's registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by parent in its reasonable discretion and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 16 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
