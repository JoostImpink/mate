security and issuer this statement relates to the class a common stock, par value $.002 per share ("class a common stock"), of infinity broadcasting corporation ("issuer"), a delaware corporation with its principal executive offices at 600 madison avenue, new york, new york 10022. item 2. identity and background the person filing this statement is westinghouse electric corporation ("westinghouse"), a pennsylvania corporation. the address of the principal office and principal business address of westinghouse is westinghouse building, 11 stanwix street, pittsburgh, pennsylvania 15222-1384. westinghouse conducts its businesses through its westinghouse/cbs group and its industries & technology group. the operations of the westinghouse/cbs group principally relate to broadcasting, while the industries & technology group provides services, fuel and equipment for the nuclear energy market, services and equipment for the power generation market, transport refrigeration services, management services at government-owned facilities, and communication and information systems. during the last five years, neither westinghouse nor, to the knowledge of westinghouse, any executive officer or director of westinghouse has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. the attached schedule i is a list of the directors and executive officers of westinghouse which contains the following information with respect to each such person: (a) name; (b) business address; and (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted. except for robert e. cawthorn and david k. p. li, who are both british citizens, each person identified on schedule i hereto is a united states citizen. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration pursuant to the stockholder agreement dated as of june 20, 1996 among westinghouse and certain stockholders of issuer set forth on schedule a thereto (the "principal stockholders"), westinghouse may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 14,722,901 shares of class a common 4 stock. see response to item 5. the principal stockholders entered into the stockholder agreement to induce westinghouse to enter into, and in consideration of its entering into, the agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20, 1996 (the "merger agreement") among westinghouse, r acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of westinghouse ("sub"), and issuer. the descriptions of the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreements, which are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 4. purpose of transaction the purpose of the stockholder agreement is to facilitate the merger of sub with and into issuer (the "merger"), with issuer surviving the merger, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference). the merger agreement provides, among other things, for changes to the board of directors and certificate of incorporation of issuer at the effective time of the merger. the merger agreement also restricts issuer from, among other things, engaging in certain transactions, including extraordinary corporate transactions (other than the merger), selling certain assets, changing its capitalization and paying dividends and otherwise requires issuer to operate in the ordinary course of business. in connection with the merger, the class a common stock will be delisted from the new york stock exchange and will become eligible for termination of registration under the securities exchange act of 1934. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer the shares subject to the stockholder agreement, as of june 20, 1996, consist of (i) 353,967 outstanding shares of class a common stock, (ii) 8,310,465 outstanding shares of class b common stock, par value $.002 per share, of issuer ("class b common stock") and (iii) 199,309 and 5,859,160 shares of class a common stock and class b common stock, respectively, issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, all of which are presently exercisable by the holder thereof, as well as any other shares of common stock acquired by any principal stockholder after june 20, 1996 and prior to the effective time of the merger. as of june 20, 1996, the shares subject to the stockholder agreement represent 52.0% of the aggregate voting power ("voting power") of issuer (1/) (assuming no exercise of warrants and options subject to the stockholder agreement) and 64.9% of the aggregate voting power (assuming exercise of all warrants and options subject to the stockholder agreement). as of june 20, 1996, the shares of class a common stock subject to the stockholder agreement represent 0.7% of the class a common stock outstanding, and less than 0.1% of the voting power (in each case, assuming exercise in full of warrants to purchase 199,303 shares of class a common stock). the shares of class b common stock subject to the stockholder agreement are convertible into shares of class a common at - --------------- (1/) as of june 20, 1996, issuer has three classes of common stock outstanding entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders: class a common stock, class b common stock and class c common stock, par value $.002 per share ("class c common stock"). for most matters submitted to a vote of stockholders (including the merger), holders of class a common stock, class b common stock and class c common stock will be entitled to one vote, ten votes and one vote, respectively. 5 any time and automatically convert upon the occurrence of certain events. however, under the terms of the stockholder agreement, the principal stockholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer such shares or convert such shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock. if, however, such shares of class b common stock were converted into shares of class a common stock, as of june 20, 1996, the shares subject to the stockholder agreement would consist of 14,722,901 shares of class a common stock representing, 16.2% of the class a common stock outstanding, or 16.0% of the voting power (in each case, assuming exercise of all options and warrants in full subject to the stockholder agreement). accordingly, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, westinghouse may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of 14,722,901 shares of class a common stock. under the terms of the stockholder agreement, the principal stockholders also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, (i) to vote their shares of class a common stock and class b common stock in favor of the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) to vote such shares against any alternative takeover proposal or amendment to issuer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws which would impede the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. accordingly, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, westinghouse may be deemed to have acquired shared voting and dispositive power with respect to all such shares. except as described above, neither westinghouse nor, to westinghouse's knowledge, any person named in schedule i beneficially owns any shares of class a common stock or has effected any transactions in class a common stock during the past 60 days. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer the information set forth under items 3, 4 and 5 above

pennsylvania corporation ("parent"), r acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), and infinity broadcasting corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company"). whereas the respective boards of directors of parent, sub and the company, and parent acting as the sole stockholder of sub, have approved the merger of sub with and into the company (the "merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of class a common stock, par value $.002 per share, of the company ("company class a common stock"), each issued and outstanding share of class b common stock, par value $.002 per share, of the company ("company class b common stock") and each issued and outstanding share of class c common stock, par value $.002 per share, of the company ("company class c common stock" and, together with the company class a common stock and the company class b common stock, the "company common stock"), in each case other than shares owned directly or indirectly by parent or the company, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration (as defined in
