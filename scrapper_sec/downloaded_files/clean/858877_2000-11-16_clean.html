vote the shares as lawful attorney and proxy of the stockholder agreement stockholders, cisco (or any nominee of cisco) will be limited, at every issuer stockholders meeting and every written consent in lieu of such meeting to vote the shares in favor of approval of the merger and the reorganization agreement. the stockholder agreement stockholders may vote the shares on all other matters. the

(e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. as an inducement to cisco to enter into the reorganization agreement, certain affiliates of isssuer (collectively, the "affiliates") have entered into a company affiliate agreement, dated as of may 4, 2000 (the "company affiliate agreement"), with cisco. other than the

or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the

(e) transfers of ownership. if any certificate for shares of parent common stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of parent common stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to section 1.6; provided, however, that parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against parent, the surviving corporation or the exchange agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 1.10 tax consequences. it is intended by the parties hereto that the merger shall constitute a

withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts

parent and the surviving corporation. 1.12 termination of exchange agent funding. any portion of funds (including any interest earned thereon) or certificates for shares of parent common stock held by the exchange agent which have not been delivered to holders of certificates pursuant to this article i within six months after the effective time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate,

(b) company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities; provided, however, that (i) parent shall not be entitled to demand more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements hereunder and (ii) company will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 40 days after such request in the case of clause (a) below or 90 days in the case of clauses (b) and (c) 5 6 below) when (a) company is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes (i) would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, (ii) after consultation with counsel to company, such information would have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time; (b) company is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving company or any of its affiliates. if consummation of the sale of any registrable securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within 120 days after the filing with the sec of the initial registration statement, the provisions of this section 9 shall again be applicable to any proposed registration; provided, however, that parent shall not be entitled to request more than two registrations pursuant to this section 9. company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 9 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as parent may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that company shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. (c) the registration rights set forth in this section 9 are subject to the condition that parent shall provide company with such information with respect to parent's registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to parent as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for company, is necessary to enable company to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. (d) if company's securities of the same type as the registrable securities are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the new york stock exchange, the nasdaq national market, or any other securities exchange or automated quotations system, company, upon the request of parent, shall promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation, trading or listing the shares of registrable securities on such exchange or system and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation, trading or listing as soon as practicable. (e) a registration effected under this section 9 shall be effected at company's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and the expenses of counsel to parent, and company shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner and (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary to transactions of this type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering. 6 7 10. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. (a) in the event of any change in company common stock by reason of stock dividends, splitups, mergers (other than the merger), recapitalizations, combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the company option, and the purchase price per share provided in section 1, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that parent shall receive, upon exercise of the company option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that parent would have received in respect of the company common stock if the company option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable.
