and (ii) merger sub was merged with and into the issuer (items (i) and (ii), collectively, the &#147;initial acquisition&#148;). as a result of the initial acquisition (which closed on october 17, 2005), the issuer survived the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of chart holdings (and thereby an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of fund x), with chart holdings owning the equivalent of 7,952,180 shares of common stock. the total consideration paid to effect the initial acquisition was $467.7 million, which amount includes $18.7 million of fees and expenses. of this $467.7 million, approximately $111.3 million consisted of funds contributed by the partners of fund x. the remainder of the consideration to finance the initial acquisition came from funds raised by the offering of the issuer&#146;s $170.0 million senior subordinated notes due 2015, and borrowings under the issuer&#146;s $240.0 million senior secured credit facility. on november 23, 2005, the issuer granted a warrant to chart holdings to purchase up to 2,651,012 shares of common stock at a per share purchase price of $14.00 (the &#147;warrant shares&#148;). chart holdings exercised this warrant for all of the 2,651,012 warrant shares on may 18, 2006, and paid the issuer an aggregate exercise price of $37.1 million. the source of funds for the acquisition of the warrant shares was funds contributed to chart holdings by the partners of fund x. in connection with the issuer&#146;s initial public offering on july 25, 2006, the issuer declared a stock dividend payable to the holders of record of the issuer&#146;s common stock issued and outstanding on july 25, 2006 (the &#147;record date&#148;). the payment of such stock dividend was contingent upon whether the underwriters in the issuer&#146;s initial public offering exercised their option to purchase up to an additional 1,875,000 shares of common stock (the &#147;over-allotment option&#148;) on or prior to august 24, 2006 (the &#147;expiration date&#148;). the proceeds of any such shares sold from the over-allotment option were intended to be paid to the stockholders as of the record date, but the underwriters did not purchase any of the 1,875,000 over allotment shares prior to the expiration date. on august 25, 2006, the issuer distributed the stock dividend of 1,875,000 shares ratably to the holders of its common stock as of the record date. chart holdings received 1,773,022 shares of the issuer&#146;s common stock pursuant to this stock dividend. item 4. purpose of transaction the acquisitions of common stock by the reporting persons were undertaken for investment purposes. the reporting persons also intend to participate in and influence the affairs of the issuer through exercise of their rights to appoint directors to the issuer&#146;s board of directors (pursuant to the stockholder agreement, described in item 6) and through their voting rights with respect to all of their shares of common stock. the reporting persons intend to review their investment in the issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price of and other market conditions relating to the common stock or other securities of the issuer, subsequent developments affecting the issuer, the issuer&#146;s business and prospects, other investment and business opportunities available to the reporting persons, general stock market and economic conditions, tax considerations, the eventual liquidation of fund x in accordance with its partnership agreement, and other factors deemed relevant, may decide to increase or decrease the size of their investment in the issuer. except as set forth in this item 4, the reporting persons do not have any specific plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) as of august 25, 2006, the reporting persons (other than chart holdings, as noted below) beneficially owned an aggregate of 12,384,212 shares of common stock, constituting approximately 48.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (calculated in the manner set forth below). the 12,384,212 shares consist of 12,376,214 shares directly owned by chart holdings, and 7,998 aggregate shares of common stock underlying the 2,666 restricted stock units of the issuer (&#147;rsus&#148;) issued to each of timothy h. day, ben a. guill, and kenneth w. moore under the issuer&#146;s amended and restated 2005 stock incentive plan. the fund entities (but not chart holdings) are entitled to a portion of the profits from the sale of such restricted stock units and any underlying shares of common stock, and may therefore be deemed to share beneficial ownership over such securities. the percentage of ownership set forth above is obtained (in accordance with rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i)(d)) as follows: &#149; with respect to the fund entities, by dividing (i) the 12,384,212 shares of common stock beneficially owned by such reporting persons; by (ii) 25,596,041 outstanding shares of common stock, comprised of (a) 23,713,043 shares of common stock outstanding as of august 18, 2006 (as indicated in the issuer&#146;s form 10-q filed on august 21, 2006); plus (b) 1,875,000 shares of common stock issued on august 25 2006 upon the stock dividend described in item 3, above, plus (c) the 7,998 aggregate shares of common stock underlying the rsus; and &#149;

plus (b) 1,875,000 shares of common stock issued on august 25 2006 upon the stock dividend described in item 3. &#149; the difference in the percentage ownership is minor: 48.38% for the fund entities, and 48.37% for chart holdings. (b) all of the reporting parties are controlled by first reserve, and as a result of such control share the power to vote and dispose of all of the shares of common stock noted in item 5(a). (c) in addition to the transactions described in item 3, the fund entities may be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of 7,998 shares of common stock underlying the 2,666 restricted stock units granted on july 25, 2006 by the issuer under its amended and restated 2005 stock incentive plan to each of timothy h. day, ben a. guill, and kenneth w. moore.
