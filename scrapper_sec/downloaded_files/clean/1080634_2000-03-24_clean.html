august 17, 1999 ("the registration statement"), all of the issued and outstanding shares of stone canyon colorado (which was 2,901,007) were exchanged for shares of synergy technologies on a

beneficial ownership of shares of the registrant was therefore 4,539,612. prior to september 9, 1999, the registrant was not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 and thus stone canyon canada was not required to report such acquisition at that time. since then, but prior to september 9, 1999, stone canyon canada sold 2,559,257 shares of the registrant's common stock through both private transactions and transactions effected through the market. it also purchased a certain number of shares. as of september 9, 1999, stone canyon canada beneficially

investment in the common stock and synergy's business affairs and financial condition, as well as conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions. stone canyon canada may in the future take such actions in respect of its investment in the common stock as it deems appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time. currently, these actions include continuing to hold the shares it now beneficially owns or disposing of shares. such dispositions could be effected in private transactions, through a public offering or, upon compliance with the rules

opportunities available to stone canyon canada, developments with respect to its business, general economic conditions, the market price for shares of common stock and stock market conditions. except as set forth in item 6, contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer, stone canyon canada has no present plans or proposals which relate to or
