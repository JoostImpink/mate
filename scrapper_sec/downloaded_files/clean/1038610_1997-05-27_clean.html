(b) priority on piggyback registrations. the company shall permit the ----------------------------------- holders to include all such registrable shares on-the-same terms and conditions as any similar securities, if any, of the company included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company or the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advise the holders in writing that the total amount of securities requested to be included in such piggyback registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the price per 7 share of the securities to be sold), then the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the holders and other holders of securities who have piggyback registration rights with respect thereto shall be reduced (to zero if necessary) pro rata on the basis of the number of common stock equivalents requested to be registered by each such holder or holder participating in such offering. (c) right to abandon. nothing in this section 3 shall create any ---------------- liability on the part of the company to the holders if the company in its sole discretion should decide not to file a registration statement proposed to be filed pursuant to section 3(a) hereof or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its filing and prior to the later of its effectiveness or the

whether as a result of the issuance by the company of any notice hereunder or otherwise. 4. holdback agreement. if (i) the company shall file a registration ------------------ statement with respect to the common stock or similar securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, such securities and (ii) the company (in the case of a nonunderwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the holders in writing that a public sale or distribution of registrable shares would materially adversely affect such offering or the managing underwriter or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten public offering by the company pursuant to such registration statement) advises the company in writing (in which case the company shall notify the holders) that a public sale or distribution of registrable shares would have material adverse impact on such offering, then each holder shall, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, refrain from effecting any public sale or distribution of registrable shares during the 10 days prior to the effective date of such registration statement and until the earliest of (a) the abandonment of such offering, (b) 90 days from the effective date of such registration statement and (c) if such offering is an underwritten offering, the termination of any "hold back" period

form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriters and counsel to the holders of the registrable shares being sold), addressed to each selling holder of registrable shares covered by such registration statement and each of the underwriters as to the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters may be reasonably requested by such counsel and underwriters, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public

receipt of such request, the company may exclude such holder's registrable shares from such registration statement. each holder of registrable shares covered by a registration statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 5(d)(ii), 5(d)(iii), 5(d)(iv) or 5(d)(v) hereof, that such holder shall forthwith discontinue

(b) indemnification by holder of registrable shares. in connection ----------------------------------------------- with any registration statement in which a holder is participating, such holder shall furnish to the company in writing such information as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with such registration statement or the related prospectus and agrees to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, the company, its directors, officers, agents or employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act) and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, from and against all losses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or the related prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is based upon any information so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such holder to the company expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus. (c) if any person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the party - ------------------ from which such indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying party") of any claim or ------------------ of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to indemnitee party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced by such delay or failure. the indemnifying party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such indemnified party of such claim or proceeding, to assume, at the indemnifying party's expense, the defense of any such claim or proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that (i) an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless: (1) the indemnifying party agrees to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the indemnifying party fails promptly to assume the defense of such claim or proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; or (3) the named parties to any proceeding (including impleaded parties) include both such indemnified 14 party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are inconsistent with those available to the indemnifying party or that a conflict of interest is likely to exist among such indemnified party and any other indemnified parties (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party); and (ii) subject to clause (3) above, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all of the indemnified parties, or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. whether or not such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party, such indemnified party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent. the indemnifying party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section ------------ 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses (other than in accordance with its terms), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the this section 8(d). notwithstanding the provision of this section 8(d), an indemnifying party that is a holder shall not be required to contribute any amount which is in excess of the amount by which the total proceeds received by such holder from the sale of the registrable shares sold by such holder (net of all underwriting discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 15 9. rule 144. if the company shall have filed a registration -------- statement pursuant to the requirements of section 12 of the exchange act or a registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the securities act, the company covenants that it will timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act or the exchange act (including but not limited to the reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the exchange act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of rule 144 adopted by the sec under the securities act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder (or if the company is not required to file such reports, the company will, upon the request of any holder of registrable shares, make publicly available other information), and will take such further action as any holder of registrable shares may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder of registrable shares to sell registrable shares within the exemption provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. upon the request of any holder of registrable shares, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 10. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) termination. this agreement and the obligations of the company ----------- and the holders hereunder (other than section 8 hereof) shall terminate on the first date on which no registrable shares remain outstanding.

(d) entire agreement; no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement ---------------------------------------------- constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. (e) assignment. neither this agreement nor any of the rights, ---------- interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by any holder without the consent of the company, or by the company without the consent of holders of at least a majority in number of the registrable shares then outstanding provided that any holder can assign its rights hereunder to a permitted transferee or permitted assignee of $15 million or more in value of common stock without the consent of the company. subject to the preceding sentence, this agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. in no event shall any transferee of common stock be entitled, solely as a result of such transfer, to any of the benefits of this agreement or to enforce the same. 18 (f) governing law. this agreement shall be construed, interpreted and ------------- the rights of the parties determined in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware (without reference to the choice of law provisions), except with respect to matters of law concerning the internal corporate affairs of any corporate entity which is a party to or the subject of this agreement, and as to those matters the law of the jurisdiction under which the respective entity derives its powers shall govern. (g) severability. each party agrees that, should any court or other ------------ competent authority hold any provision of this agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. upon any such holding that any provision of this agreement is null, void or unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this agreement are consummated to the extent possible. except as otherwise contemplated by this agreement, to the extent that a party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other competent authority, such party shall incur no liability or obligation unless such party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment. (h) injunctive relief. the parties acknowledge that it will be ----------------- impossible to measure in money the damages that would be suffered if the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved person or entity will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. any such person or entity shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this agreement, none of the parties shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

necessary to pay any such excise taxes, the executive shall promptly return such overage to the company. the purpose of this paragraph 10 is to place the executive, his designated beneficiary and his dependents in the same position on an after-tax basis that each of them would have been in if the termination payment and all other amounts payable to the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents under this agreement or under any plan, program or policy of the company, and all benefits provided to the executive or his dependents under this agreement or under any plan, program or 19 policy of the company, had not been subject to any excise taxes. 11. attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses. the executive, his -------------------------------------------- designated

from the date due until paid. payments received by the executive, his designated beneficiary or his dependents (or any of their respective heirs, executors, administrators and personal
