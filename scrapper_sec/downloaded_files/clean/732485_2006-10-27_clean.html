tender offer to acquire all outstanding anormed shares (the " offer ") by increasing the purchase price per anormed share from $8.55 to $13.50 and extending the expiry time of the offer to 8:00 a.m. (vancouver time) on november 6, 2006 (the " expiry time "), subject to further extension, and anormed agreed to recommend that its shareholders accept the offer. concurrent with the execution of the support agreement, the reporting persons entered into shareholder support agreements (the " shareholder support agreements ") with kenneth galbraith and several investment partnerships managed by baker brothers advisors, l.l.c. and its affiliates (each a " supporting shareholder " and together, the " supporting shareholders "). the information set forth and/or incorporated by reference in item

one of its affiliates will provide all funding required by dematal in connection with the offer from cash on hand. references to, and descriptions of, the support agreement and the shareholder support agreements as set forth above in this item 3 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the support agreement and the shareholder support agreements included as exhibit 2 and

conditional upon, among other things, there being validly deposited to the offer and not withdrawn at the expiry time such number of anormed shares which constitutes at least 66 2 / 3 % of the anormed shares outstanding, calculated on a fully-diluted basis. subject to applicable law, dematal reserves the right to withdraw the offer and to not take up and pay for any anormed shares deposited in the

takes up and pays for the anormed shares validly deposited under the offer, dematal intends to acquire any anormed shares not deposited under the offer through a compulsory acquisition under section 206 of the canadian business corporations act, if available, or to propose a subsequent acquisition transaction, in each case for cash consideration per anormed share equal in value to the consideration paid by dematal per anormed share under the offer. the exact timing and details of any such transaction will depend upon a number of factors, including the number of anormed shares acquired pursuant to the offer. although dematal intends to propose such a transaction generally on the terms described herein, it is possible that, as a result of delays in dematal's ability to effect such a transaction, information subsequently obtained by dematal, changes in general economic or market conditions or in the business of anormed, or other currently unforeseen circumstances, such a transaction may not be proposed, may be delayed or abandoned or may be proposed on different terms. accordingly, dematal reserves the right not to propose such a transaction, or to propose a subsequent acquisition transaction on terms other than as described herein. anormed has agreed that, immediately following the acquisition pursuant to the offer by dematal of at least a majority of the outstanding anormed shares and from time to time thereafter, it will cooperate with dematal and upon request will use its reasonable efforts to secure the resignations of such number of anormed directors as may be required to enable dematal's designees to be elected or appointed to the anormed board of directors and expand the size of anormed's board of directors. cusip no. 035910108 schedule 13d page 7 of 10 pursuant to the support agreement, anormed has agreed that, during the period from the date of the support agreement until the support agreement is terminated by its terms,

course and consistent with past practice and in compliance with applicable laws; and (b) anormed will not do or permit to occur actions relating to (i) the amendment of anormed's governing documents; (ii) the declaration, payment or setting aside of any dividend or other distribution of any kind in respect of anormed securities; (iii) the issuance, sale or pledge of anormed securities other than anormed shares issuable upon the exercise of the options of anormed outstanding on the date of the support agreement; (iv) the redemption or acquisition of anormed securities; (v) the split, combination or reclassification of the anormed shares; (vi) the liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of anormed; (vii) the reduction of anormed's stated capital; (viii) the reorganization, amalgamation or merger of anormed with another person; (ix) the sale, pledge, lease, disposition or encumbrance of assets over a certain value outside of the ordinary course; (x) certain acquisitions of or investments in another person or division thereof, certain contributions of capital to and certain property transfers to or from another person or division; (xi) the incurrence of debt or liabilities or the making of loans or advances outside the ordinary course of business; (xii) capital expenditures outside the ordinary course of business and over a certain value; (xiii) the discharge of material claims, liabilities or obligations outside the ordinary course of business; (xiv) the relinquishment of material rights or material change to material contracts or material permits; (xv) the entering into of certain contracts; (xvi) the commencement or settlement of certain litigation or claims; and (xvii) the authorization or proposal of any of the foregoing. notwithstanding the foregoing from time to time after november 6, 2006, anormed may issue debt or equity securities to raise money for its working capital needs and enter into agreements in connection therewith, provided that the amount of such financing does not exceed (i) u.s.$15 million in the aggregate for any financing or financings completed prior to november 15, 2006, or (ii) u.s.$30 million in the aggregate, and provided further that any such capital raising transaction or transactions are on an arm's length basis with the majority of the funds provided by an unaffiliated third party. following the completion of the offer, genzyme intends to conduct a review of anormed's operations and business strategy with a view to determining how best to combine anormed's operations with those of genzyme in order to streamline the commercialization of anormed's product candidate, mozobil, and optimize operational effectiveness. the mozobil clinical, regulatory and commercial programs will be incorporated into the genzyme transplant business unit. genzyme also plans to assess the various opportunities and risks associated with anormed's ongoing research and development efforts such as its hiv program and the other chemokine receptor-based oncology and cell therapy applications. following a detailed assessment of the potential value of these programs, genzyme will determine whether additional investment or dedication of resources is warranted. if permitted by applicable law, subsequent to the completion of the offer and a compulsory acquisition or any subsequent acquisition transaction, if necessary, dematal intends to delist the anormed shares from the tsx and nasdaq global market and cause anormed to cease to be a reporting issuer under the securities laws of each province of canada in which it is a reporting issuer. dematal also intends to seek to cause anormed to apply for termination of registration of the anormed shares under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the " exchange act "), as soon after the completion of the offer as the requirements for such termination are met. cusip no. 035910108 schedule 13d page 8

capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure including but not limited to, if the issuer is a registered closed-end

charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the issuer to be

genzyme corporation (nasdaq: genz) and anormed inc. (nasdaq: anor; tsx: aom) announced today that they have executed a mutually beneficial support agreement under which genzyme will acquire anormed in an all cash transaction valued at us$13.50 per outstanding share, or approximately us$580 million. through this transaction, genzyme is acquiring mozobil, a leading late-stage product candidate in development for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. mozobil is being tested in phase iii clinical trials and is expected to launch in 2008. "we are very pleased to have reached agreement with anormed, and look forward to completing the development and commercialization of mozobil," stated henri a. termeer, chairman and chief executive officer of genzyme corporation. "we believe that mozobil will be an important therapeutic advance in the field of stem cell transplantation, and are eager to utilize our global clinical, regulatory and commercial infrastructure to ensure that it reaches patients around the world. this is a strategic fit for us that complements our existing transplant and oncology businesses." kenneth galbraith, the chairman of the board and interim chief executive officer of anormed, said "anormed's board of directors, in consultation with its strategic initiatives committee and with the advice of its financial and legal advisors, believes the amended us$13.50 per share offer represents the best alternative currently available to anormed shareholders and provides a certain and fair value for anormed shareholders. the board unanimously recommends that anormed shareholders accept and tender their shares to the amended genzyme offer." kenneth galbraith and the baker bros. affiliates have signed shareholder support agreements with genzyme to tender their shares to genzyme's amended bid when it is filed, subject to their ability to withdraw such support in the event of a superior competing proposal prior to the expiry of the genzyme offer. mozobil development genzyme plans to commercialize mozobil through its existing global transplant business to hematologists and bone marrow transplant centers in more than 50 countries throughout the world. mozobil has been shown in multiple earlier studies to rapidly increase the number of stem cells in circulation in the blood, an important step in preparing a patient for a stem cell transplant. increasing the number of stem cells collected can improve patient outcomes in two ways: by helping patients who were previously not eligible to meet the target ranges needed for a transplant; and by raising the level of stem cells collected in those already eligible, thereby improving the viability of the transplant. according to genzyme, approximately 55,000 stem cell transplants are performed each year for multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and other conditions in markets where genzyme has a commercial infrastructure, including the united states, europe, latin america and the asian pacific countries. a majority of these patients could potentially benefit from the use of mozobil. enrollment is complete in a pivotal phase iii trial for mozobil in multiple myeloma, and a second pivotal phase iii trial in non-hodgkin's lymphoma is expected to complete enrollment soon. mozobil has been granted orphan drug status in the united states and european union and anormed has entered into a special protocol assessment agreement with the fda. transaction terms genzyme's acquisition of anormed will take the form of an all cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of anormed, which will expire at 8:00 a.m. (vancouver time) on november 6, 2006. genzyme may elect to extend its existing offer again by giving notice of such extension to anormed shareholders, a copy of which will be filed with the securities regulatory authorities in canada and the united states and which should also be made available by such authorities through the internet at www.sedar.com or www.sec.gov . anormed shareholders who have already tendered and have not withdrawn their shares to genzyme's offer need to take no further action to accept genzyme's offer. all anormed shareholders are eligible to receive the offer price per share of us$13.50, including shareholders who have already tendered their shares. as of 8:00 a.m. on october 17, 2006, approximately 3,120 anormed shares had been tendered and not withdrawn to genzyme's offer. the support agreement with genzyme also provides anormed with the right to withdraw, modify or change its support regarding genzyme's tender offer of us$13.50 per share in cash only if anormed's board of directors receives a superior proposal prior to the expiry of the genzyme tender offer. genzyme has the right to match any such superior proposal made by another bidder. if anormed's board accepts a superior proposal after genzyme does not match such proposal, genzyme may be entitled to a payment of us$19.5 million from anormed. the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to clearance under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act. it is expected to be dilutive to genzyme's gaap earnings through 2008 and accretive in 2009. in association with the acquisition, genzyme anticipates it will incur certain one time charges, which will be detailed after the close of the transaction. on september 5, 2006, anormed filed with the united states and canadian securities regulatory authorities a directors' circular and tender offer solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 in which anormed's board of directors recommended that shareholders reject the september 1, 2006 unsolicited offer from dematal corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of genzyme corporation. on october 5, 2006, anormed filed with the united states and canadian securities regulatory authorities a directors' circular and tender offer solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 in which anormed's board of directors recommended that shareholders accept the october 5, 2006 offer from sidney acquisitions ulc, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of millennium pharmaceuticals, inc. these directors' circulars describe the reasons for the board's recommendation that shareholders reject the genzyme offer and accept the millennium offer. investors and shareholders are strongly advised to read the directors' circulars and tender offer solicitation/recommendation statements on schedule 14d-9, as well as any amendments and supplements to those documents, because they contain important information. investors and shareholders may obtain a copy of the directors' circulars at www.sedar.com and the tender offer solicitation/recommendation statements on schedule 14d-9 from the sec website at www.sec.gov . free copies of these documents can also be obtained by directing a request to anormed's secretary at suite 200 - 20353 64th avenue, langley, british columbia, canada v2y 1n5;

and by raising the level of stem cells collected in those already eligible, thereby improving the viability of the transplant. according to genzyme, approximately 55,000 stem cell transplants are performed each year for multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and other conditions in markets where genzyme has a commercial infrastructure, including the united states, europe, latin america and the asian pacific countries. a majority of these patients could potentially benefit from the use of mozobil. enrollment is complete in a pivotal phase 3 trial for mozobil in multiple myeloma, and a second pivotal phase 3 trial in non-hodgkin's lymphoma is expected to complete enrollment soon. mozobil has been granted orphan drug status in the united states and european union and anormed has entered into a special protocol assessment agreement with the fda. transaction terms genzyme's acquisition of anormed will take the form of an all cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of anormed, which will expire at 8:00 a.m. (vancouver time) on november 6, 2006. genzyme may elect to extend its existing offer again by giving notice of such extension to anormed shareholders, a copy of which will be filed with the securities regulatory authorities in canada and the united states and which should also be made available by such authorities through the internet at www.sedar.com or www.sec.gov . anormed shareholders who have already tendered and have not withdrawn their shares to genzyme's offer need to take no further action to accept genzyme's offer. all anormed shareholders are eligible to receive the offer price per share of $13.50, including shareholders who have already tendered their shares. as of 8:00 a.m. on october 17, 2006, approximately 3,120 anormed shares had been tendered and not withdrawn to genzyme's offer. the support agreement with genzyme also provides anormed with the right to withdraw, modify or change its support regarding genzyme's tender offer of $13.50 per share in cash only if anormed's board of directors receives a superior proposal prior to the expiry of the genzyme tender offer. genzyme has the right to match any such superior proposal made by another bidder. if anormed's board accepts a superior proposal after genzyme does not match such proposal, genzyme may be entitled to a payment of $19.5 million from anormed. the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, and is subject to clearance under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act. it is expected to be dilutive to genzyme's gaap earnings through 2008 and accretive in 2009. in association with the acquisition, genzyme anticipates it will incur certain one time charges, which will be detailed after the close of the transaction. about genzyme one of the world's leading biotechnology companies, genzyme is dedicated to making a major positive impact on the lives of people with serious diseases. this year marks the 25 th anniversary of genzyme's founding. since 1981, the company has grown from a small start-up to a diversified enterprise with more than 8,500 employees in locations spanning the globe and 2005 revenues of $2.7 billion. genzyme has been selected by fortune as one of the "100 best companies to work for" in the united states. d-5 with many established products and services helping patients in more than 80 countries, genzyme is a leader in the effort to develop and apply the most advanced technologies in the life sciences. the company's products and services are focused on rare inherited disorders, kidney disease, orthopedics, cancer, transplant and immune diseases, and diagnostic testing. genzyme's commitment to innovation continues today with a substantial development program focused on these fields, as well as heart disease and other areas of unmet medical need. about anormed inc. anormed is a chemistry-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of new therapeutic products in the areas of hematology, oncology and hiv, based on the company's research into chemokine receptors. the company's product pipeline includes mozobil, currently in pivotal phase iii studies in cancer patients undergoing stem cell transplants;
