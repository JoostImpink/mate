(c) merger or asset sale. in the event of a merger of the company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company, each outstanding option and stock purchase right shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the option or stock purchase right, the optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the option or stock purchase right as to all of the optioned stock, including shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. if an option or stock purchase right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the administrator shall notify the optionee in writing or electronically that the option or stock purchase right shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the option or stock purchase right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. for the purposes of this paragraph, the option or stock purchase right shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share of optioned stock subject to the option or stock purchase right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of ordinary shares for each share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the option or stock purchase right, for each share of optioned stock subject to the option or stock purchase right, to be solely common stock of the successor -9- corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of ordinary shares in the merger or sale of assets. 13. time of granting options and stork purchase rights. the date of grant of an option or stock purchase right shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the administrator makes the determination granting such option or stock purchase right, or such other date as is determined by the administrator. notice of the determination shall be given to each service provider to whom an option or stock purchase right is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. 14. amendment and termination of the plan.

(b) underwriting. the substantive provisions of section 2.5(b) shall be applicable to each registration initiated under this section 2.7.
