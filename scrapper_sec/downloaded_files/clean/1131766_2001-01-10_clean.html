on december 21, 2000, the partnership purchased the debentures for an aggregate purchase price of $70,500,000. as of december 21, 2000, the debentures were convertible into 21,692,307 common shares at a rate of $3.25 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the debentures. those common shares represented (on december 21, 2000) 19.7% of the outstanding common shares (assuming conversion in full of the debentures). the source of funds for the purchase of the debentures was the purchase of partnership interests in the partnership by clgi (its general partner) and the limited partners. the debentures were purchased by the partnership pursuant to the debenture purchase agreement dated as of december 12, 2000 by and between the issuer and the partnership. the debenture purchase agreement and the debentures are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. item 4. purpose of transaction. the partnership purchased the debentures for investment purposes. pursuant to the debenture purchase agreement, the issuer caused mr. ammon to be appointed as of december 21, 2000 as a member of the board of directors of the issuer for the current term of the issuer's board of directors and the issuer also agreed to cause mr. ammon's nomination for election to the board of directors at each subsequent meeting of the issuer's shareholders to elect directors. in addition, pursuant to the

also became the chief executive officer of the issuer concurrently with his appointment to the issuer's board of directors. in connection with the partnership's purchase of the debentures, two additional independent directors were appointed to the issuer's board of directors. as a director of the issuer, mr. ammon will participate in meetings of the board of directors of the issuer and in the course of such participation may from time to time participate in matters to develop or suggest plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions or transactions enumerated

directly owns all the debentures. the partnership does not own any common shares, but because the debentures were (as of december 21, 2000) convertible into 21,692,307 common shares, the partnership may be deemed to beneficially own such common shares. those common shares represent approximately 19.7% of the outstanding common shares of the issuer, based on a total of 88,456,940 common shares outstanding as of december 21, 2000. the partnership may be deemed to have shared power to vote or direct the vote and shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of 21,692,307 common shares. clgi, as the general partner of the partnership, and mr. ammon, as the sole shareholder of clgi, may be deemed to beneficially own the 21,692,307 common shares, or 19.7%, owned by the partnership and to have shared power to vote or direct the vote and shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of those common shares. the only transaction by the reporting persons in the common shares was the purchase of the debentures described in item 3. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the partnership has entered into the registration rights agreement, dated as of december 21, 2000, between the partnership and the issuer, providing for the registration or qualification of common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures. the partnership and clgi have entered into the standstill agreement, dated as of december 21, 2000, among the partnership, clgi and the issuer, providing for restrictions on additional purchases of securities of the issuer and other matters relating to control of the issuer. the partnership, clgi and certain limited partners of the partnership have entered into the restricted securities agreement, dated as of december 12, 2000, providing for transfer restrictions on the common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures and for certain "tag along" rights of the partners and rights of first refusal (conditioned on a transferring limited partner first obtaining a bona fide third party offer to purchase the transferring limited partner's common shares). also pursuant to the restricted securities agreement, chancery lane mic, l.p., one of the limited partners of the partnership, is entitled to utilize one of the two demand registration rights provided to

any such issue of common shares by way of a stock dividend shall be deemed to have been made on the record date for the stock dividend (subject to payment of such stock dividend) for the purpose of calculating the number of outstanding common shares under paragraphs 1.3(b) and (c) below; (b) if and whenever after the date hereof and prior to the maturity date, the corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding common shares entitling them to subscribe for or purchase common shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares) at a price per common share (or having a conversion or exchange price per common share) less than 95% of the current market price (as defined below) of a common share on such record date, the conversion price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect on such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of common shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of common shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional common shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible securities so offered) by such current market price per common share, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of common shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional common shares offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible); any common shares owned by or held for the account of the corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation; such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not so issued or any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the conversion price shall be readjusted to the conversion price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or to the conversion price which would then be in effect based upon the number of common shares (or securities convertible into common shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, as the case may be;

any common shares owned by or held for the account of the corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation; such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; to the extent that such distribution is not so made, the conversion price shall be readjusted to the conversion price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or to the conversion price which would then be in effect based upon such common shares or rights, options, warrants or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or evidences of indebtedness or assets actually distributed, as the case may be. the fair market value of such shares or rights, options, warrants or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or evidences of indebtedness or assets so distributed shall be determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of the board of directors of the corporation; (d) for the purposes of this debenture, the "current market price" per common share at any date shall be the average of the closing sale price per common share for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately before such date on the toronto stock exchange, or, if the common shares are not listed thereon, on the new york stock exchange, or, if the common shares are not listed thereon, on such national stock exchange on which the common shares are listed as may be selected for such purpose by the board of directors of the corporation or, if the common shares are not listed on any such national stock exchange, then as quoted through the nasdaq national market system or, if the common shares are not listed on any stock exchange or quoted through the nasdaq national market system, then on the over-the-counter market (where an "active trading market" exists). an "active trading market" shall not be deemed to exist when the spread between the bid and ask prices per common share exceeds 15%. if there is no active trading market, the "current market price" shall be determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of the board of directors of the corporation whose determination shall be conclusive unless the holder, within 10 business days after receiving written notice of such determination (delivered to the holder's address as set forth in the debenture register), objects to such determination, in which event the - 5 - corporation and the holder shall make their best good faith efforts to reach a mutually agreeable determination. in the event that agreement cannot be reached by the parties within 30 days after notice of objection, such question shall be submitted to arbitration by a single arbitrator who shall be a nationally-recognized investment banking firm selected by the corporation and the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debentures. the determination of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding. if within 10 days after the end of the 30-day period the parties have not agreed upon the identity of the arbitrator, either party may, on notice to the other party, apply to a judge of the federal southern district court of new york to appoint the arbitrator; (e) [reserved] (f) if and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the maturity date, there is a consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a vertical short-form amalgamation with one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to the business corporation act (ontario)), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity in which the holders of common shares are entitled to receive shares, other securities or other property (any of such events being called a "capital reorganization"), the holder upon conversion of this debenture after the effective date of such capital reorganization will be entitled to receive upon conversion of this debenture, and will accept for the same aggregate consideration in lieu of the number of common shares to which the holder was previously entitled upon such conversion, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property, including cash, which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such capital reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the holder had been the registered holder of the number of common shares to which the holder would have been entitled upon conversion hereof; subject, however, to any requirements necessary to ensure that the capital reorganization will not alter the canadian taxes (as defined in subsection 3.1) on payments under or in respect of this debenture, including, without limitation, the requirement that if such capital reorganization should occur on or prior to the day after the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, the holder will be entitled to receive, at the option of the corporation, and will accept in lieu of the number of common shares to which the holder would have been entitled upon such conversion: (i) common shares of the corporation or the resulting corporation provided any such common shares are listed on a prescribed stock exchange as defined in the income tax act (canada) and which qualify as prescribed shares, as defined in regulation 6208 of the income tax act (canada) generally, such that the fair market value of the number of such common shares equals the fair market value of the consideration on the date of such capital reorganization that the holder would - 6 - have been entitled to receive upon capital reorganization had this debenture been converted into common shares immediately prior thereto; or (ii) the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property, including cash, that the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such capital reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the holder had been the registered holder of the number of common shares to which the holder would have been entitled upon conversion hereof; the corporation shall take all steps necessary to ensure that, after the effective date of a capital reorganization, the holder will receive the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property, including cash, to which the holder is entitled as a result of such capital reorganization; (g) in the case of any reclassification of, or other change in, the outstanding common shares of the corporation other than a subdivision, redivision, reduction, combination or consolidation referred to above, the conversion price shall be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time, as the board of directors of the corporation, acting reasonably and in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances. notwithstanding anything contained in this subsection 1.3(g), no adjustment of the conversion price shall be completed without the prior written consent of the toronto stock exchange. the corporation shall submit all applications and other materials necessary or advisable to obtain the prior written consent of the toronto stock exchange under this subsection 1.3(g) as soon as practicable after determining any need to adjust the conversion price hereunder and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such prior written consent as soon as practicable; (h) the adjustments provided for in paragraphs (a) to (f) are cumulative and shall apply to successive subdivisions, redivisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this subsection 1.3, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 1.3, no adjustment of the conversion price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion price then in effect; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph 1.3(h) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and (i) in the event of any dispute arising with respect to the computation of adjustments provided in subsection 1.3, such question shall be conclusively determined by a firm of chartered accountants appointed by the corporation and acceptable to the holder acting reasonably (who may be the auditors of the corporation); such accountants shall have access to all necessary records of the corporation and such determination shall be binding on the holder. - 7 - 1.4 rules regarding calculation of adjustment of conversion price. for the purposes of subsection 1.3: (a) the adjustments provided for in subsection 1.3 are cumulative and will be computed to the nearest one-tenth of one cent and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following paragraphs of this subsection 1.4; (b) no adjustment in the conversion price will be required upon the issuance or the exercise, from time to time, of options under any stock option plan or grant/purchase plan, or the purchase or grant of common shares under any stock purchase or grant plan, in either case for directors, employees or officers of the corporation adopted by the corporation from time to time; (c) no adjustment in the conversion price will be made in respect of any event described in subsection 1.3, other than the events referred to in paragraph 1.3(a), if the holder is allowed by the corporation to participate in such event on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if it had converted this debenture in whole prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event, as applicable. 1.5 no requirement to issue fractional shares. the corporation shall not be required to issue fractional common shares upon the conversion of this debenture pursuant to this section 1. if any fractional interest in a common share would, except for the provisions of this subsection 1.5, be deliverable upon the conversion of any principal amount of this debenture, the corporation shall round up such fractional interest to the next highest whole number of common shares and deliver to the holder a whole number of common shares. 1.6 corporation to reserve shares. the corporation covenants with the holder that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized common shares, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of this debenture as in this section 1 provided, such number of common shares as shall then be issuable upon the conversion in whole of this debenture. the corporation covenants with the holder that all common shares which shall be so issuable shall be duly and validly issued as fully paid and non-assessable. 1.7 taxes and charges on conversion. the corporation will from time to time promptly pay or make provision satisfactory to the holder for the payment of any and all stamp and similar taxes and charges which may be imposed by the laws of canada or any province thereof (however in no event shall the corporation be required to pay any security transfer tax, income tax or other tax) which shall be payable with respect to the issuance and/or delivery to the holder, upon the exercise of its right to conversion, of common shares pursuant to the terms of this debenture. 1.8 cancellation of converted debenture. if this debenture is converted in whole or in part under the provisions of this section 1, the holder shall forthwith deliver this debenture or - 8 - portion hereof so converted to the corporation for cancellation. if this debenture is converted in part under the provisions of this section 1, the corporation shall issue to the holder a new certificate representing the unconverted portion of this debenture. 1.9 certificate as to adjustment. the corporation shall from time to time, promptly following the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in subsection 1.3, deliver to the holder a certificate of a senior financial officer or of any other officer of the corporation whose responsibilities extend to the subject matter of such certificate specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based, which certificate and the amount of the adjustment specified therein shall be conclusive and binding on all parties in interest. the corporation shall, except in respect of any subdivision, redivision, reduction, combination or consolidation of the common shares, forthwith give notice to the holder in the manner provided in section 10 specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the results thereof, including the resulting conversion price. 1.10 notice of special matters. the corporation covenants with the holder that, so long as this debenture remains outstanding, it will give notice to the holder, in the manner provided in section 10, of its intention to take any action (other than an action set forth in paragraph 1.3(a)) that may give rise to an adjustment in the conversion price at the same time as any public announcement thereof and in any event no later than the time at which holders of common shares are notified of any such action, and, in each case, such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the corporation shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as shall have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. such notice shall be given not less than 14 days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date, whichever is earlier. 1.11 legends on conversion shares. all certificates representing the common shares that are from time to time issued upon conversion of this debenture shall bear the following legend: "the common shares represented by this certificate are subject to the debenture purchase agreement dated as of december 12, 2000 (a copy of which is on file with the secretary of the corporation) which provides, among other things, for certain restrictions on the transfer thereof. the common shares represented by this certificate may not be sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with said agreement." - 9 - upon any transfer pursuant to sections 8.2(c), (d) or (e) or section 8.3 of the debenture purchase agreement (other than a private market sale to a member of the restricted group) and upon the release date, the corporation shall issue new certificates with the foregoing legend removed. all certificates representing the common shares that are issued in conversion of this debenture (unless a registration statement under the u.s. securities act with respect to such common shares is then effective or a receipt or receipts for a final canadian prospectus have been obtained to qualify such common shares under the ontario securities act and other applicable canadian securities legislation) shall bear the following legend until such time as the purchaser or any transferee thereof delivers an opinion of counsel to the holder satisfactory to the corporation, acting reasonably, to the effect that such legend is no longer required under the u.s. securities act or the ontario securities act and other applicable canadian securities legislation: "the securities represented by this certificate were issued without registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and without qualification by prospectus under canadian securities laws and may be offered or sold only if registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or qualified by prospectus under canadian securities laws or if an exemption from such registration or qualification is available." 2. redemption 2.1 optional redemption. the corporation may, at any time after the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, subject to the holder's right to first convert in whole or in part this debenture into common shares, redeem this debenture, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price (the "redemption price") equal to: (i) 105.80% of the principal amount of this debenture, if such redemption occurs during the period from the fifth anniversary to and including the sixth anniversary of the date hereof; (ii) 102.90% of the principal amount of this debenture, if such redemption occurs during the period from the sixth anniversary to and including the seventh anniversary of the date hereof; and (iii) 100.00% of the principal amount of this debenture, if such redemption occurs after the seventh anniversary of the date hereof, in each case together with accrued interest to but excluding the redemption date (as hereinafter defined). 2.2 election to redeem; notice to holder. the corporation shall give the holder written notice of an optional redemption pursuant to subsection 2.1 not less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption (the "redemption date"), specifying the redemption date and the redemption price applicable to such redemption. during such 30-day period, the holder may inform the corporation of its intent to exercise its right to convert this debenture, in whole or in part, - 10 - into common shares. if such notice is given, the conversion of this debenture will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 1 prior to the redemption date so as to make the provisions of subsection 2.1 inapplicable to the portion of this debenture elected to be so converted. 2.3 debenture payable on redemption date. notice of redemption having been given, this debenture shall, on the date fixed for such redemption, become due and payable at the redemption price, and from and after such date (unless the corporation shall default in the payment of such price and accrued interest), in the same manner and with the same effect as if it were the maturity date specified in this debenture, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, and from and after such redemption date, upon payment of the redemption price having been made to the holder, this debenture shall not be considered as outstanding and interest upon this debenture shall cease to accrue after said date. the amount to be paid in respect of this debenture shall be paid by the corporation at the redemption price together with accrued interest to such date; provided, however, that installments of interest due on or prior to such date shall be payable to the holder at the close of business on the relevant record dates according to their terms. if the amount payable in respect of this debenture selected for redemption shall not be so paid or made available for payment, the unpaid amount shall, until paid, bear interest from the date fixed for such redemption at 10.70% per annum. 2.4 decision regarding optional redemption. the decision by the corporation to exercise its optional redemption right pursuant to this section 2 shall be made by a majority vote of a committee of the board of directors of the corporation comprised of non-management directors that are not affiliated with the corporation or the holder. 2.5 cancellation of redeemed debenture. if this debenture is redeemed under the provisions of this section 2, the holder shall forthwith deliver this debenture to the corporation for cancellation. 3. additional amounts and contingent right of redemption 3.1 payment of additional amounts. all payments made by the corporation under or with respect to this debenture will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge imposed or levied by or on behalf of the government of canada or of any province or territory thereof or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax (hereinafter "canadian taxes"), unless the corporation is required to withhold or deduct canadian taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. if the corporation is so required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of canadian taxes from any payment made under or with respect to this debenture, the corporation will pay such additional amounts ("additional amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the holder (including additional amounts) after such withholding or deduction will be equal to the amount the holder would have received if such canadian taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provided that no additional - 11 - amounts will be payable with respect to any canadian taxes ("excluded taxes") to the extent such canadian taxes are due by reason of (i) the corporation not dealing at arm's length (within the meaning of the income tax act (canada)) with the holder at the time of making such payment or (ii) the holder being connected with canada or any province or territory thereof otherwise than by the mere holding of this debenture or by reason of the receipt, or enforcement of receipt, of payments hereunder. the corporation will also (i) make such withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. the corporation will furnish to the holder within 30 days after the date the payment of any canadian taxes is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the corporation. the corporation will indemnify and hold harmless, and upon written request, reimburse the holder or such member of the purchaser group and each direct and indirect owner of an equity interest in the holder for the amount of (i) any canadian taxes (other than excluded taxes) so levied or imposed which have not been withheld or deducted and remitted by the corporation as required by this section 3 and which have been paid by such person as a result of payments made under or with respect to this debenture, (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto and (iii) any canadian taxes imposed with respect to any reimbursement under (i) and (ii). 3.2 limitation on additional amounts. notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) (i) if withholding is required in respect of canadian taxes, (ii) the rate of such withholding exceeds 10% of any payment and (iii) the corporation exercises its initial optional redemption right set forth in subsection 3.3, or (b) if following the initial limiting time (as defined below) (i), an increased rate of withholding is required in respect of canadian taxes as a result of a change in law or the interpretation or administration thereof by the relevant government authority or agency (a "change in canadian tax law") and (ii) the corporation exercises its subsequent optional redemption (as defined below) right set forth in subsection 3.3, the obligation of the corporation to pay any additional amounts or to make any reimbursement in respect of any canadian taxes imposed on any payment made by the corporation under or with respect to the debentures shall be determined as if the rate of withholding required in respect of canadian taxes did not exceed 10% of the amount of any payment. if the holder (which, for these purposes includes a direct or indirect owner of any equity interest in the holder) is, in its reasonable opinion, able to apply for or otherwise take advantage of any tax credit, tax deduction or similar benefit by reason of any withholding or deduction made by the corporation on account of canadian taxes in respect of any payment made by it hereunder (or where less than all of such payment gives rise to additional amounts, the portion of such payment that gives rise to additional amounts), then such holder will use such endeavours as it considers appropriate to obtain such credit, deduction or benefit and upon receipt thereof will pay to the corporation such amount (if any) not exceeding the additional amounts determined in accordance with the limitations in this subsection 3.2 paid by the corporation as equals the net after-tax value to such holder of such part of such credit, deduction or benefit as it considers is allocable to such withholding or deduction having regard to all its dealings giving rise to similar credits, deductions or benefits in relation to the same tax period and to the cost of obtaining the same, provided that nothing herein shall (i) interfere with the right of such holder to arrange its tax - 12 - affairs in whatever manner it deems fit and in particular such holder shall not be under any obligation to claim relief from its profits or similar tax liability in respect of any such deduction or withholding in priority to or pro rata with any other relief, claims, credits or deductions available to it; and (ii) such holder shall not be obligated to disclose to the corporation any information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations. 3.3 optional redemption in certain circumstances. if (i) additional amounts are payable pursuant to subsection 3.1 and (ii) subsection 3.2 would limit the additional amounts otherwise payable to the holder at that time (assuming the corporation were to exercise its initial optional redemption right under this subsection 3.3) (the "initial limiting time"), the corporation shall have the right, exercisable for a period of 30 days after the initial limiting time, to redeem (the "initial optional redemption") this debenture in whole (but not in part) on the same basis, mutatis mutandis, as if such redemption were a redemption made pursuant to section 2; provided, however, that the redemption price (as such term is used in section 2) for purposes of a redemption pursuant to this subsection 3.3 shall, in all circumstances, equal 102.90% of the principal amount of this debenture. if at any time following the initial limiting time (i) additional amounts are payable pursuant to subsection 3.1 as a result of an increased rate of withholding required in respect of canadian taxes as a result of a change in canadian tax law and (ii) subsection 3.2 would limit such additional amounts otherwise payable by the holder at that time (assuming the corporation were to exercise its subsequent optional redemption right under this subsection 3.3) (a "subsequent limiting time"), the corporation shall have the right, exercisable for a period of 30 days after such subsequent limiting time, to redeem (a "subsequent optional redemption") this debenture in whole (but not in part) on the same basis, mutatis mutandis, as if such redemption were a redemption made pursuant to section 2; provided, however, that the redemption price (as such term is used in section 2) for purposes of a redemption pursuant to this subsection 3.3 shall, in all circumstances, equal 102.90% of the principal amount of debenture. if the corporation exercises its optional redemption right pursuant to this subsection 3.3, the holder shall have the right to notify the corporation that the holder requires the corporation not to redeem this debenture, notwithstanding the exercise by the corporation of its optional right to redeem, in which case this debenture shall remain outstanding and any additional amounts payable thereon shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of, and limitation contained in, subsection 3.2. for the avoidance of doubt, the holder acknowledges that after the initial limiting time, if the corporation has exercised its initial optional redemption right under this subsection 3.3, the limitation on additional amounts described in subsection 3.2 shall apply and the corporation shall not be required to pay additional amounts which exceed the limitation on additional amounts described in subsection 3.2 unless (i) an increased rate of withholding is required in respect of canadian taxes as a result of a change in canadian tax law and (ii) the corporation elects not to exercise its right of subsequent optional redemption. 3.4 additional amounts generally. whenever in this debenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or any other amount payable by the corporation under or with respect to this debenture, such mention shall be deemed to include -13- mention of the payment of additional amounts to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. the obligations of the corporation under this section 3 shall survive the payment of all amounts under or with respect to this debenture and shall survive any termination of the debenture purchase agreement. 4. change of control of the corporation 4.1 change of control offer. (a) upon the occurrence of a change of control not resulting from the purchaser group beneficially owning more than 50% of the total voting power in the aggregate of all classes of shares in the capital of the corporation then outstanding normally entitled to vote in elections of directors, the corporation shall, pursuant to an offer (subject only to conditions required by applicable law, if any) by the corporation (the "change of control offer"), offer to purchase for cash all or any part of this debenture (provided, that the principal amount of this debenture must be $100,000 or an integral multiple thereof) on a date (the "change of control purchase date") that is no later than 90 days after the occurrence of such change of control, at the change of control purchase price specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the change of control purchase date. the change of control offer shall be made within 30 business days following the change of control and shall remain open for acceptance for 20 business days following its commencement (the "change of control offer period"). upon the expiration of the change of control offer period, the corporation shall promptly purchase all of this debenture or part hereof properly tendered in response to the change of control offer. for greater certainty, the holder may at any time, including while a change of control offer is outstanding, but prior to any tender of this debenture to such change of control offer, convert this debenture in whole or in part in accordance with section 1. (b) if debentures remain outstanding after the making of a change of control offer, the corporation shall have the right, exercisable for a period of 30 days after the change of control purchase date, to redeem this debenture in whole (but not in part) on the same basis, mutatis mutandis, as if such redemption were a redemption made pursuant to section 2; provided, however, that the redemption price (as such term is used in section 2) for the purposes of a redemption pursuant to this paragraph 4.1(b), shall be the change of control purchase price determined pursuant to subsection 4.3. 4.2 "change of control". as used herein, a "change of control" means: (i) any merger or consolidation of the corporation with or into any person or any sale, transfer or other conveyance, whether direct or indirect, of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation on a consolidated basis, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, if, immediately after giving effect to such transaction(s), any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used -14- for purposes of sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the exchange act, whether or not applicable), is or becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is used in rule 13d-3 of the exchange act or any successor provision thereto), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power in the aggregate normally entitled to vote in the election of directors, managers or trustees, as applicable, of the transferee(s) or surviving entity or entities; (ii) any "person" or "group" becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power in the aggregate of all classes of shares in the capital of the corporation then outstanding normally entitled to vote in elections of directors; or (iii)during any period of 12 consecutive months after the date hereof, individuals, together with successors selected by such individuals, who at the beginning of any such 12-month period constituted the board of directors of the corporation cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, as a result of the election and/or removal of directors by shareholder vote that did not include the affirmative vote of any member of the purchaser group. 4.3 "change of control purchase price". as used herein, "change of control purchase price" means: (a) if the change of control purchase date occurs at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, 105.00% of the outstanding principal amount hereof tendered or redeemed; (b) if the change of control purchase date occurs at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the date hereof and prior to the sixth anniversary of the date hereof, at a price equal to 102.90% of the outstanding principal amount hereof tendered or redeemed; and (c) if the change of control purchase date occurs at any time on or after the sixth anniversary of the date hereof and prior to the maturity date, at a price equal to the outstanding principal amount hereof tendered or redeemed. 4.4 payment on acceptance. on or before the change of control purchase date, the corporation will (i) accept for payment this debenture or portion hereof properly tendered pursuant to the change of control offer, (ii) pay any holder that has accepted such offer an amount equal to the change of control purchase price (together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any) in respect of this debenture or portion hereof tendered to the change of control offer, and (iii) if only a -15- portion hereof is tendered to the change of control offer, authenticate and deliver to the holder a new debenture equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of this debenture surrendered. 5. maturity; non-presentation 5.1 payment on maturity date. on the maturity date and upon delivery to the corporation of this debenture, the corporation shall pay the principal amount of this debenture in cash together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. 5.2 non-presentation of debenture. if the holder shall fail to present this debenture for payment on the date on which the principal thereof and/or the interest thereon or represented thereby becomes payable either at maturity or on redemption or otherwise or shall not accept payment on account thereof and give such receipt therefor, the corporation shall be entitled to set aside the principal monies and/or the interest, as the case may be, in trust to be paid to the holder upon due presentation and surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this debenture; and thereupon the monies and/or the interest payable on or represented by each debenture in respect whereof such monies have been set aside shall be deemed to have been paid and thereafter this debenture shall not be considered as outstanding and the holder shall thereafter have no right in respect hereof except that of receiving payment of the monies so set aside by the corporation (without interest thereon) upon due presentation and surrender of this debenture. 6. ranking; subordination 6.1 ranking. this debenture shall rank senior in right of payment, in bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise, to all shares in the capital of the corporation and payments thereon (which payments shall be subordinate in all respects to payment of amounts in respect of this debenture), including, without limitation, the common shares and the preference shares. 6.2 subordination. this debenture shall be, and is hereby made, subordinate and subject in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to the prior payment in full of all indebtedness of the corporation other than the indebtedness evidenced by the debentures (hereinafter referred to as the "other indebtedness"), whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred. this debenture shall be pari passu in right of payment with all other debentures. 6.3 distributions, etc. upon any distribution of the assets of the corporation upon any dissolution or winding-up or total liquidation of the corporation (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors of the corporation or otherwise): (a) all other indebtedness shall first be paid in full, or provision made for such payment, before any payment is made on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by this debenture; -16- (b) any payment or distribution of assets of the corporation, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the holder would be entitled except for the provisions of this section 6, shall be paid or delivered by the person making such payment or distribution directly to the holders of the other indebtedness or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any of such other indebtedness may have been issued, to the extent necessary to pay all such other indebtedness in full after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution, or provision therefor, to the holders of such other indebtedness; (c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the corporation, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by the holder before all other indebtedness is paid in full or provision made for its payment, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of such other indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any of such other indebtedness may have been issued, for application to the payment of all such other indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all such other indebtedness after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution, or provision therefor, to the holders of such other indebtedness; and (d) any payments or distributions paid over to the holders of the other indebtedness pursuant to this section 6 and not applied in reduction of the amounts owing to the holder shall be deemed not to have discharged any of the obligations of the corporation hereunder (and, to the extent that by operation of applicable law they are treated as doing so, the corporation hereby agrees to indemnify the holder on demand from and against any loss suffered or incurred by it in consequence thereof). 6.4 reliance. upon any payment or distribution of assets of the corporation referred to in this section 6, the holder shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate of the person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the holder, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the other indebtedness, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this section 6. 6.5 subrogation. subject to the payment in full of all other indebtedness, the rights of the holder shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such other indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of the corporation made on such other indebtedness, until the principal of and interest on this debenture shall be paid in full and no such payments or distributions to the holder of cash, property or securities which otherwise would be payable or distributable to the holders of other indebtedness shall, as between the corporation, its creditors other than the -17- holders of such other indebtedness, and the holder be deemed to be a payment by the corporation to or on account of the other indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this section 6 are, and are intended solely for, the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holder, on the one hand, and the holders of other indebtedness, on the other hand. nothing contained in this section 6 or elsewhere in this debenture is intended to or shall impair, as between the corporation and its creditors (other than the holder), the obligation of the corporation, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the holder the principal of and interest on this debenture (or issue conversion shares on conversion thereof), as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with its terms or otherwise to comply with any other terms hereof or related to this debenture, or affect the relative rights of the holder and creditors of the corporation, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this debenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this section 6 of the holders of other indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the corporation received upon the exercise of any such remedy. 6.6 no payment to holder if event of default under other indebtedness. (a) upon the maturity of any other indebtedness by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise, then, except as hereinafter otherwise provided in paragraph 6.6(d), all principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all such matured other indebtedness shall first be paid in full, or shall first have been duly provided for, before any payment on account of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the debenture is made. (b) except as hereinafter otherwise provided in subsection 6.6(d), the corporation shall not make any payment on account of this debenture at any time when an event of default, as defined in any other indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same and permitting the holders thereof to accelerate the maturity thereof, has occurred and is continuing and notice of such event of default has been given to the corporation by or on behalf of the holders of other indebtedness, in each case unless and until the other indebtedness has been paid and satisfied in full or unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist. (c) the fact that any payment hereunder is prohibited by this section 6 will not prevent the failure to make such payment from being an event of default hereunder. (d) for greater certainty, this section 6 shall not be construed so as to prevent any payments on account of this debenture which are made at any time when no event of default, as defined in any other indebtedness or the instrument creating the same and permitting the holders thereof to accelerate the maturity thereof, has occurred and is continuing. 6.7 payment of principal and interest at any time. nothing contained in this section 6 shall affect the obligation of the corporation to make, or prevent the corporation from making, at any time except during the continuance of an event of default under other indebtedness that bars the corporation from making payments hereunder, on pendency of any dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the corporation, payment of the outstanding principal of and interest on this debenture. 6.8 rights of holders of other indebtedness not impaired. no right of any present or future holder of any other indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein will at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the corporation or by any non-compliance by the corporation with the terms, provisions and covenants of this debenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. 7. covenants of the corporation 7.1 covenants. the corporation hereby covenants and agrees with the holder as follows: (a) to pay principal, premium and interest. the corporation will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid to the holder the principal of and interest accrued on this debenture, and premium, if any, thereon, on the dates, at the places, in the moneys and in the manner mentioned herein. (b) to carry on business. subject to the express provisions hereof, the corporation will at all times maintain its corporate existence and will keep or cause to be kept proper books of account in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. (c) financial statements; information. the corporation will furnish to the holder the financial statements and other information referred to in the debenture purchase agreement. (d) forebearance on restrictions on rights of the holder. except as otherwise provided herein, the corporation will not enter into any agreement or instrument or otherwise agree to any covenant that would in any way limit the right of the holder to convert this debenture into common shares. 7.2 issuance of common shares at a discount. the corporation hereby covenants and agrees with the holder that it will not issue common shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares) at a price (or in consideration for assets having a fair market value) per common share (or having a conversion or exchange price per common share) less than 95% of the current market price of a common share, unless: -19- (a) the provisions of section 1.3 would apply to such issuance and the relevant provisions thereof are complied with or the provisions of section 1.4 would exempt such issuance from the application of section 1.3; (b) such issuance is in connection with the purchase of a business as a going concern and in respect of which the corporation shall have received a fairness opinion from a nationally-recognized investment banking firm selected by the corporation; (c) prior to such issuance, the corporation obtains the approval of the toronto stock exchange to adjust the conversion price immediately after such issuance so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect on such issuance date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of common shares outstanding on such issuance date plus a number of

provided, that if such demand occurs during a black out period (as defined below) or other period (not to exceed 90 days) during which moore is prohibited or restricted from filing a registration statement or a canadian prospectus pursuant to any underwriting or purchase agreement relating to an underwritten rule 144a offering or registered or qualified public offering of securities in which clgi was offered piggy-back rights pursuant to section 3 (a "lock up period"), moore shall notify clgi of the basis therefore and shall not be required to notify the holders of any subject securities of such demand or file such registration statement or canadian prospectus prior to the end of the black out period or lock up period, as the case may be, in which event, moore will file such registration statement or canadian prospectus no later than the later of (a) 120 days after the original demand and (b) 60 days after the end of the -5- black out period or lock up period, as the case may be;

provided, further, that any period suspended, including the effectiveness period, shall be extended by the number of days in any black out period occurring during such period.

(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if clgi or any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 6(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the obligations of clgi, any other holder of subject securities and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals in this section 6(d) to contribute shall be several (in proportion to the percentage of subject securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them) and not joint. (e) notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6, in no event will either (i) clgi or any other holder of subject securities selling such securities pursuant to a registration statement or canadian prospectus hereunder be liable to any person under this section 6 or otherwise with respect to any registration or prospectus qualification hereunder for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds to be received by clgi from the sale of its subject securities (after deducting any discounts and commissions applicable thereto, but before deducting any expenses) pursuant to any (i) in the case of a u.s. filing, registration statement and (ii) in the case of a canadian filing, canadian prospectus, under which such subject securities are to be registered under the securities act or canadian securities laws, as the case may be, or (ii) any underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional be liable to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the discount, commission or other -20- compensation payable to such underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional with respect to the subject securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. (f) the obligations of moore under this section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which moore may otherwise have to any indemnified person and the obligations of any indemnified person under this section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which such indemnified person may otherwise have to moore. the remedies provided in this section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity. 7. rule 144. - ------------- in the case of a u.s. filing, moore covenants that it will timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder (or, if moore is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of clgi make publicly available such information as necessary to permit sales pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act), and it will take such further action as clgi may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable clgi to sell subject securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec, including providing any legal opinions. upon the request of clgi, moore will deliver to clgi a written statement as to whether it has complied with such information and requirements. 8. approval for listing. - ------------------------- promptly after the date hereof and after any subsequent increase in the number of subject securities, moore shall take all necessary action to cause all of the subject securities to be approved for listing, subject to official notice of issuance, on, at the election of clgi or such holder of subject securities, either the new york stock exchange or the toronto stock exchange, as the case may be, or other securities exchange or dealer quotation system on which the common shares may then be listed or authorized for quotation. 9. term of registration rights. - -------------------------------- the rights of clgi and any other holder of subject securities with respect to the registration rights granted pursuant to this agreement shall remain in effect, subject to the terms hereof, so long as there are subject securities or securities which are convertible or exchangeable for subject securities issued and outstanding. 10. further agreements. - ----------------------- (a) the parties agree that, subject to the advance notice requirements of the debentures, any conversion of debentures into common shares shall occur, at the option of the exchanging or converting holder, contemporaneously with the registration or qualification of the common -21- shares to be received, or the consummation of the sale of such common shares pursuant to such registration or qualification, or at such other time as such holder shall request in writing. (b) moore will not file any registration statement under the securities act or file a canadian prospectus under canadian securities laws unless it shall first have given to clgi and any other holder of subject securities for so long as clgi or such other holder owns beneficially (as such term is defined in the exchange act or canadian securities laws, as the case may be) 6.6% or more of the common shares of moore at the time outstanding or is otherwise deemed to be a control person under the securities act or canadian securities law, at least 10 days' prior written notice thereof and, if so requested by clgi or such other holder within 10 days after such notice, clgi and such other holder shall have the right, at any time when, in the reasonable judgment of clgi or such other holder, clgi or such holder is or might be deemed a controlling person of moore within the meaning of the securities act or canadian securities laws, (a) to participate in the preparation and filing of each such registration statement or prospectus to the extent provided in section 4 hereof; (b) to receive the documents and notices specified in section 4 hereof and to make the requests specified in section 4 hereof; (c) to receive signed copies of the documents specified in section 4 hereof addressed to clgi and such other holder; and (d) to require moore to pay the fees and disbursements of counsel to clgi and such other holder which assists in such participation. if any such registration statement or prospectus refers to clgi or such other holder by name or otherwise as the holder of any securities of moore, then clgi and such other holder shall have the right (in addition to any other rights it may have under this agreement) to require, in the event that such reference to clgi or such other holder, by name or otherwise is not required by the securities act or canadian securities laws or any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the deletion of the references to clgi and such other holder. 11. miscellaneous. - ------------------ (a) remedies. clgi and any other holder of subject securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein and granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. moore agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) registration rights of other persons. as of the date hereof, moore has not granted to any person the right to request a registration of securities of moore under the securities act and/or canadian securities laws or the right to be included as a selling stockholder in connection with any registration of subject securities. moore may grant to any person other than clgi the right to request a registration of securities of moore under the securities act and/or canadian securities laws or the right to be included as a selling stockholder in connection with any registration of subject securities; provided, however, that the granting of any such rights shall not conflict with or otherwise alter any rights granted to clgi hereunder; and provided, further that this agreement shall be amended to provide clgi and each of the -22- holders of subject securities with the benefit of any term in such agreement that is more favorable than a term herein. the rights granted to clgi hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of moore's securities under any other agreements. (c) adjustments affecting subject securities. moore will not take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to the subject securities which would (i) adversely affect the ability of clgi or any other holder of subject securities to include such subject securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this agreement or (ii) adversely affect the marketability of such subject securities in any such registration. (d) amendments and waivers. this agreement, including this section 11(d), may be amended, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may be given, only by a written instrument duly executed by moore and clgi and each other holder of subject securities. each holder of subject securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this section 11(d), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, waiver or consent appears on the subject securities or is delivered to such holder.

(c) partnership obligation to redeem or exchange class a limited partnership interests at maturity. the partnership shall redeem or exchange any outstanding class a limited partnership interests on the fifth anniversary of their initial issuance (the "class a maturity redemption date"), as follows. the partnership shall deliver written notice to the representative class a partner not less than 30 days prior to the class a maturity redemption date requesting such partner to notify the partnership whether such partner wishes to redeem or exchange the class a limited partnership interests. within 5 days of receipt of the partnership's notice, the representative class a partner shall notify the partnership in writing whether it wishes to (i) redeem the class a limited partnership interests for cash in the amount of the class a preference and any accrued but unpaid class a periodic distributions in respect of the class a limited partnership interests to be exchanged, (ii) exchange such interests for debentures or conversion shares in the class a stock redemption amount and a cash payment for any accrued but unpaid class a periodic distributions in respect of the class a limited partnership interests to be exchanged or (iii) exchange such interests for a combination of such cash and securities. the partnership shall then be obligated to redeem or exchange the class a limited partnership interests in accordance with the representative class a limited partner's notice on the class a maturity redemption date. notwithstanding the foregoing, the partnership has the right not to redeem the relevant portion of the class a limited partnership interests for cash, and may instead keep such interests outstanding, in which case such interests thereafter shall accrue class a periodic distributions at the rate of 15% per annum on the class a principal preference and the class a deferral preference until paid. if the interests remain outstanding, the partnership thereafter may at any time redeem or exchange such outstanding interests in accordance with the notice procedures, periods and right of the representative class a limited partner to elect its form of consideration as set forth above for the class a maturity redemption date. the partnership shall in any event be required to redeem or exchange such outstanding interests in accordance with such notice procedures, periods and right of the representative class a limited partner to elect its form of consideration as set forth above for the class a maturity redemption date, no later than the eight and one-half year anniversary of the closing under the debenture purchase agreement.

(e) unpaid class a periodic distributions and interest on debentures in debenture exchange. without limiting the partnership's obligation to pay any accrued and unpaid class a periodic distributions in connection with an exchange of class a limited partnership interests for debentures or conversion shares, whenever this agreement provides that a person shall receive accrued but unpaid class a periodic distributions in respect of a class a limited -12- partnership interest being exchanged for debentures, the person receiving the debentures in such exchange (the "exchanging partner") shall not receive, and the partnership shall retain all rights to, accrued but unpaid interest on such debentures to the date of exchange. if, after the exchange any class a periodic distributions are unpaid in respect of any class a limited partnership interest exchanged for debentures, the partnership shall pay to the exchanging partner interest received in respect of such debentures to the extent necessary to satisfy such unpaid class a periodic distributions. the exchanging partner agrees to execute such documents as the partnership may reasonably request to assure that interest payments are paid from the company as set forth above. section 4.5 pro rata treatment. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement or elsewhere, in no event shall any distribution, payment or other transfer of property be made by the partnership with respect to the class b limited partnership interests, nor shall any offer be made to redeem any class b limited partnership interests, in each case other than on a pro rata basis with respect to all class b partnership interests based upon their respective percentage interests. section 4.6 class b limited partnership exchange. to the extent that the general partner may cause the partnership to dispose of debentures or conversion shares pursuant to section 5.4(b)(9) without the consent of the representative class a limited partner (the amount of disposable debentures or conversion shares being the "available disposal amount"), each class b limited partner shall have the right to require the general partner to cause the partnership to deliver to the class b limited partner up to such class b limited partner's percentage interest in the available disposal amount of debentures or conversion shares in exchange for an appropriate portion of its class b limited partnership interest. article v partnership interests section 5.1 liability of limited partners.
