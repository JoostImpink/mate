(g) indemnification by the lenders . each lender shall severally indemnify the administrative agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any indemnified taxes attributable to such lender (but only to the extent that borrower has not already indemnified the administrative agent for such indemnified taxes and without limiting the obligation of borrower to do so), (ii) any taxes attributable to such lender&#146;s failure to comply with the provisions of section 9.07(c) relating to the maintenance of a participant register and (iii) any excluded taxes attributable to such lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the administrative agent in connection with any margin loan documentation, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any lender by the administrative agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. each lender hereby authorizes the administrative agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such lender under any margin loan documentation or otherwise payable by the administrative agent to the lender from any other source against any amount due to the administrative agent under this paragraph (g). (h) (i) borrower shall deliver to each agent, on or before the date hereof (and thereafter promptly from time to time upon the reasonable request of an agent), (i) a duly executed copy of the appropriate irs form w-8 that it is (or if it is disregarded, its regarded owner is) not a u.s. person for u.s. federal income tax purposes. borrower shall promptly notify each agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide the irs form or certification described in the preceding sentence. 45 (ii) borrower shall deliver (to the extent it is legally entitled to do so) to the agents, at the time or times reasonably requested by such agents, such properly completed and executed documentation as is reasonably requested by agents in order to permit a lender or lenders to receive payments with respect to the collateral or to exercise rights under section 7.01 and the security agreements in a manner that will avoid, to the extent possible, or minimize withholding tax upon receipt of payments or upon a foreclosure sale of any collateral. (i) [ reserved ]. (j) defined terms. for purposes of this section 2.08, the term &#147;applicable law&#148; includes fatca. section 2.09 illegality . notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if any lender shall notify borrower and administrative agent that any law makes it unlawful, or any governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such lender to perform its obligations to make or maintain advances hereunder as libor advances, the obligation of such lender to make such advances shall be terminated and all such advances shall become base rate advances either on the next succeeding interest payment date, if such lender may lawfully continue to maintain the advances to such day, or immediately, if such lender may not lawfully continue to maintain the advances. section 2.10 evidence of debt . (a) each lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of borrower to such lender resulting from each advance from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time hereunder.

(c) the entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of administrative agent or any lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of borrower to repay such obligations in accordance with their terms. (d) no promissory note shall be required to evidence the advances by lenders to borrower. upon the request of a lender, borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such lender a promissory note, payable to such lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by such lender, which shall evidence the advances to borrower by such lender in addition to such records. thereafter, the advances evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns. 46 section 2.11 payments and computations .

(c) all payments (including prepayments and, subject to section 2.13, any other amounts received hereunder in connection with the exercise of any applicable lender&#146;s rights after an event of default) made by borrower to administrative agent under any margin loan documentation shall be applied to amounts then due and payable in the following order, ratably in accordance with the percentage of any such amounts owed to each lender: (a) any expenses and indemnities payable by borrower to lenders under any margin loan documentation; (b) to any accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under this agreement; (c) to principal payments on the outstanding advances; and (d) to the extent of any excess, to the payment of all other obligations under the margin loan documentation; provided that, in the case of an exercise of remedies, a lender may elect the order in which different advances are deemed to be paid. section 2.12 replacement of non-consenting lenders.

(b) notwithstanding the foregoing, following one or more lenders becoming accelerating lenders, borrower, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not make any payments of its obligations or post any collateral or provide any eligible letter of credit except on a pro rata basis (without regard to clause (a) above). for the avoidance of doubt, the application of proceeds received by an applicable lender in respect of an exercise of its remedies under the margin loan documentation shall not be considered a payment by borrower for purposes of this section 2.13(b). section 2.14 administrative agent &#146; s clawback . (a) funding by lenders; presumption by administrative agent . unless administrative agent shall have received notice from a lender prior to the relevant funding date that such lender will not make available to administrative agent such lender&#146;s advance, administrative agent may assume that each lender that has a commitment hereunder has made the relevant advance available on such date in accordance with section 2.01 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to borrower a corresponding amount. in such event, if a lender has not in fact made the relevant advance available to administrative agent, then such lender and borrower severally agree to pay to administrative agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to borrower to but excluding the date of payment to administrative agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such lender, the greater of the federal funds effective rate and a rate determined by administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by borrower, the applicable rate. if borrower and such lender shall pay such interest to administrative agent for the same or an overlapping period, administrative agent shall promptly remit to borrower the amount of such interest paid by borrower for such period. if such lender pays such advance to administrative agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such lender&#146;s advance included in such borrowing. any payment by borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim borrower may have against a lender that shall have failed to make such payment to administrative agent. (b) payments by borrower; presumptions by administrative agent . unless administrative agent shall have received notice from borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to administrative agent for the account of lenders hereunder that borrower will not make such payment, administrative agent may assume that borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to lenders the amount due. in such event, if borrower has not in fact made such 49 payment, then each of lenders severally agrees to repay to administrative agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to administrative agent, at the greater of the federal funds effective rate and a rate determined by administrative agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(b) subject to section 2.13, if, as of any interest payment date, the aggregate stated amount of eligible letters of credit provided to any applicable lender differs by more than $10,000,000 from the product of (x) the aggregate applicable percentage of such applicable lender and any relevant agented lenders and (y) the aggregate stated amount of eligible letters of credit provided to all applicable lenders, then on, or as promptly as practicable following, 50 such interest payment date, borrower shall replace eligible letters of credit provided to the applicable lenders with cash collateral and vice versa to the extent necessary to ensure that eligible letters of credit and cash collateral are held on a pro rata basis (it being understood that the minimum stated amount of an eligible letter of credit as set forth in the definition thereof shall not apply to the extent necessary to comply with this section 2.16(b)). each lender hereby consents to, and agrees to cooperate in good faith to effect, such substitutions.
