merger agreement that there were 26,379,821 shares of issuer common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on january 23, 2001. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, the stockholders have agreed, among other things, (i) to vote the subject shares (and any shares of capital stock of the issuer acquired by any stockholder after the date of the stockholder agreement and during the term of the stockholder agreement) in favor of (a) the adoption of the merger agreement, (b) the approval of the merger and (c) the approval of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) to vote the subject shares (and any shares of capital stock of the issuer acquired by any stockholder after the date of the stockholder agreement and during the term of the stockholder agreement) against (a) any merger agreement or merger (other than the merger agreement and the merger) or similar transaction and (b) any proposal or transaction that would impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) not to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of any subject shares or

shall thereafter succeed to any such office of johnson & johnson, and each of them individually, and any individual designated in writing by any of them, as his or her proxy and attorney-in-fact (the "attorney"). the name of each stockholder and the number of subject shares beneficially owned by each stockholder are set forth in schedule a to the stockholder agreement, which is attached as exhibit 2 hereto. in exercising its right to vote the subject shares as proxy and attorney-in-fact of the stockholders, the attorney's rights are limited to voting the subject shares, or granting a consent or approval with respect to the subject shares, (i) in favor of approval and adoption of the merger and the merger agreement and (ii) against any takeover proposal (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) or other proposal or transaction that would impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the stockholders may vote the subject shares on all other matters. in addition to the voting arrangements described above, the stockholder agreement contains provisions (the "profit recoupment provisions") pursuant to which (i) each stockholder is required to pay to johnson & johnson on demand all profit (determined in accordance with the stockholder agreement) of such stockholder, solely

either case within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where johnson & johnson is or may become entitled to receive a termination fee from the issuer pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement in connection with such termination and (ii) in the event that, prior to the consummation of the merger, a takeover proposal shall have been made to the issuer or with respect to the issuer, the merger shall have been consummated and johnson & johnson for any reason shall have increased the amount payable to stockholders of the issuer in connection with the merger above the amount contemplated by the merger agreement as in effect on january 26, 2001 (the "original merger consideration"), each stockholder is required to pay johnson & johnson an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of subject shares beneficially owned by such stockholder and (y) 100% of the excess, if any of (i) the per share consideration received by the stockholder as a result of the consummation of the merger, pursuant to the merger agreement as in effect on the date of such consummation, over (ii) the original merger consideration. the stockholder agreement (other than the profit recoupment provisions) terminates upon the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (ii) the date of termination of the merger agreement. the profit recoupment provisions of the stockholder agreement survive the consummation of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of (i) the end of the 12-month period referred to in the profit recoupment provisions and (ii) with respect to any stockholder, the date on which any amount payable by such stockholder to johnson & johnson thereunder has been paid in full.
