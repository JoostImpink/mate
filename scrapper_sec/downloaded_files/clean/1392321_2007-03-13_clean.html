provided that no holder shall be obligated in connection with such transfer to agree to indemnify or hold harmless the transferees with respect to an amount in excess of the net cash proceeds paid to such holder in connection with such transfer. 31 in the event of such transfer, each member shall receive in exchange for the units held by such member the same portion of the aggregate consideration from such sale or exchange that such member would have received if such aggregate consideration had been distributed by the company in complete liquidation pursuant to the rights and preferences set forth in section 12.2 (without taking into account any reductions for distributions to units). each member shall take all necessary or desirable actions in connection with the distribution of the aggregate consideration from such sale or exchange as requested by the transferring member. 11.6 substituted member. 11.6.1 an assignee of any units or other interests in the company of a member, or any portion thereof, shall become a substituted member entitled to all the rights of a member if and only if the assignor gives the assignee such right and the board has granted its prior written consent to such assignment and substitution, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the board. 11.6.2 the company and the managers shall be entitled to treat the record owner of any units or other interest in the company as the absolute owner thereof and shall incur no liability for distributions of cash or other property made in good faith to such owner until such time as a written assignment of such units or other interest in the company, which assignment is permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions of section 11.1 hereof, has been received and accepted by the board and recorded on the books of the company. 11.6.3 upon the admission of a substituted member, schedule a attached hereto shall be amended to reflect the name, address and number and class of units and other interests in the company of such substituted member and to eliminate the name and address of and other information relating to the assigning member with regard to the assigned units and other interests in the company. 11.7 effect of assignment. 11.7.1 any member who shall assign any units or other interest in the company shall cease to be a member of the company with respect to such units or other interest and shall no longer have any rights or privileges of a member with respect to such units or other interest. 11.7.2 any person who acquires in any manner whatsoever any units or other interest in the company, irrespective of whether such person has accepted and adopted in writing the terms and provisions of this agreement, shall be deemed by the acceptance of the benefits of the acquisition thereof to have agreed to be subject to and bound by all the terms and conditions of this agreement that any predecessor in such units or other interest in the company of such person was subject to or by which such predecessor was bound. 11.8 effect of incapacity . except as otherwise provided herein, the incapacity of a member shall not dissolve or terminate the company. in the event of such incapacity, the executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or other personal representative of the incapacitated 32 member shall be deemed to be the assignee of such member&#146;s units or other interests in the company and may, subject to section 11.1, become a substituted member upon the terms and conditions set forth in section 11.6. article xii dissolution, liquidation and termination 12.1 dissolution . the company shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up on the first to occur of the following: (a) the written consent of the members holding a majority of the common units;

b equals the number of shares of common stock of wstf for which willis is granted the stock options on or before 12 months following the consummation of the acquisition on account of his employment with wstf; c equals the number of shares of common stock of wstf deemed to be owned by willis pursuant to the willis carry percentage, determined as if the class b shares are fully vested and willis owned outright a number of the shares of wstf equal to the amount of shares of wstf owned by the company multiplied by the percentage to which distributions would be made to willis as the holder of class b shares under section 5.2.4; and d equals 0.7, provided that such 0.7 factor will be multiplied by (1 minus x), where x equals 0.05 for each $0.25 increment by which the option exercise price associated with such option share exceeds $5.50 per share (as such price is adjusted for stock splits, dividends and like events). such percentage reduction shall serve to reduce the applicable willis carry percentage (9.5%) so that, as provided in the agreement, the applicable willis carry percentage (if unchanged from the initial willis carry percentage) shall be increased by 5 percentage points (e.g., from 9.5% to 14.5%) if either hig has achieved a 70% irr after february 28, 2010 or received distributions equal to at least five times its aggregate capital contributions prior to february 28, 2010 with respect to distributions thereafter. a-2 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
