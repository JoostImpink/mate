(b) exchange procedures. as promptly as practicable after the effective time, sca packaging shall cause the surviving corporation to send, or will cause the exchange agent to send, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent), for use in the exchange contemplated by this section 3.02. upon surrender of a certificate to the exchange agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration as provided in this article iii in respect of the tuscarora common shares represented by such certificate (after giving effect to any required withholding tax). until surrendered as contemplated by this section 3.02, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive the merger consideration as provided in this article iii. if any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. if any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by sca packaging or the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as sca packaging or the surviving corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the proper amount of the merger consideration as contemplated by this article iii.

(d) return of merger consideration. upon demand by sca packaging, the exchange agent shall deliver to sca packaging or the surviving corporation, as designated by sca packaging, any - 7 - 12 portion of the merger consideration made available to the exchange agent pursuant to this section 3.02 that remains undistributed to holders of tuscarora common shares one hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective time. holders of certificates who have not complied with this section 3.02 prior to such demand shall thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of any claim to the merger consideration. (e) no liability. none of sca packaging, sca acquisition, the surviving corporation or the exchange agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any tuscarora common shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. any amounts remaining unclaimed by any holder of tuscarora common shares immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, become the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (f) withholding rights. each of the surviving corporation and sca packaging shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration, otherwise payable hereunder to any person, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign income tax law. to the extent that the surviving corporation or sca packaging so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of tuscarora common shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the surviving corporation or sca packaging, as the case may be. 3.03 dissenting shares. (a) notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding tuscarora common shares ("dissenting shares") held by a dissenting shareholder (as defined below) shall not be converted into the merger consideration but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such dissenting shareholder pursuant to the pbcl; provided, however, that each tuscarora common share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a dissenting shareholder who, after the effective time, loses or fails to perfect or withdraws his or her right of appraisal, pursuant to the pbcl, shall be deemed to be converted as of the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration, without any interest or dividends, if any, thereon. as used in this agreement, the term "dissenting shareholder" means any record holder or beneficial owner of tuscarora common shares who complies with all provisions of the pbcl (including the provisions of sections 1571 through 1580 of the pbcl) concerning the right of holders of tuscarora common shares to dissent from the merger and demand fair value for their shares in accordance with the pbcl.
