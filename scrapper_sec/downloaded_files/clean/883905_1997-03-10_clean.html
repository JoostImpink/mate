but shall not be obligated to (unless such indemnitee elects not to seek indemnity hereunder for such claim), upon written notice to the relevant indemnitee, assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding if the indemnifying party with respect to such claim or proceeding acknowledges to the indemnitee the indemnitee's right to indemnity pursuant hereto to the extent provided herein (as such

(a) the purchase right represented by this warrant may be exercised by the holder, in whole or in part, for up to the total number of shares then exercisable, by the surrender of this warrant (with the common stock warrant notice of exercise form attached hereto as annex i duly executed) at the principal office of the company and by the payment to the company in cash (by wire transfer), in an amount equal to the then applicable purchase price per share multiplied by the number of shares then being purchased. (b) in lieu of exercising this warrant by payment of cash, when permitted by law and applicable regulations, the holder may pay such exercise price through a "same day sale" commitment from the holder and a broker-dealer that is a member of the national association of securities dealers (an "nasd dealer") whereby the holder irrevocably elects to exercise the warrant and to sell a portion of the shares so purchased to pay for the exercise price and whereby the nasd dealer irrevocably commits upon receipt of such shares to forward the exercise price directly to the company. (c) in lieu of exercising this warrant by payment of cash or by payment through a same day sale, the holder may elect to receive, without the payment by the holder of any additional consideration, a number of shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the value of this warrant or any portion hereof by the surrender of this warrant or such portion to the company (the "net exercise"), with the net issue election initialed in the common stock warrant notice of exercise annexed hereto duly executed, at the office of the company. thereupon the company will issue to the holder such number of shares of common stock of the company as is computed using the following formula. 3 x = y (a-b) ------- a where x = the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the holder upon the net exercise pursuant to this section 1.3; y = the number of shares exercised under this warrant for which the net issue election is made pursuant to this section 1.3 (upon such net exercise, the number of shares subject to further exercise under this warrant shall be reduced by this number); a = the market price (as defined below) of one share of the company's common stock on the date the net issue election is made pursuant to this section 1.3; and b = the per share purchase price in effect under this warrant on the date the net issue election is made pursuant to this section 1.3. for purposes of this section 1.3, "market price" means, as to a share of common stock, the average of the closing prices of sales on all domestic securities exchanges on which the common stock may at the time be listed, or, if there have been no sales on any such exchange on any day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day the common stock is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted in the nasdaq national market as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or, if on any day the common stock is not quoted in the nasdaq national market, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporated, or any similar successor organization, in each such case averaged over a period of thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date the net issue election or other exercise is made pursuant to this section 1.3; provided, however, that if the common stock is listed on any domestic securities exchange the term "trading days" as used in this sentence means days on which such exchange is open for trading. if at any time the common stock is not listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted in the nasdaq national market or the domestic over-the counter market, the "market price" shall be the fair value thereof determined jointly by the company and the holder; provided, however, that if such parties are unable to reach agreement within fifteen (15) business days following written notice from the holder to the company setting forth the holder's determination of such fair value, such fair value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the company and the holder. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding on the company and the holder, and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid by the company. 1.4 limitations on exercise. the exercise of this warrant, and the issuance of the shares will be subject to and conditioned upon compliance by the company and the holder with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the company's common stock may be listed or quoted at the time of such issuance or transfer. the company shall, at its sole cost and expense, use its reasonable best efforts to make all filings, notices and applications required 4 by the company (excluding filings, notices and applications required by the holder), and take all other actions necessary to permit the exercise of this warrant by the holder and the issuance of the shares to the holder, and the holder shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the company in connection therewith. this warrant may not be exercised as to fewer than 50,000 shares unless it is exercised as to all shares as to which the warrant is then exercisable. 1.5 issuance of new warrant. in the event of any exercise of the purchase right represented by this warrant, certificates for the shares so purchased will be delivered to the holder within four (4) business days after receipt of such payment and, unless this warrant has been fully exercised or has expired, a new warrant representing the portion of the shares, if any, with respect to which this warrant will not then have been exercised will also be issued to the holder within a reasonable time. 1.6 hart scott-rodino compliance. (a) the company hereby acknowledges that the exercise of this warrant by holder may subject the company and/or the holder to the filing requirements of the hart-scott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 (the "hsr act") and that the holder may be prevented from closing the exercise of this warrant until the expiration or early termination of all waiting periods imposed by, and compliance with all other requirements under, the hsr act ("hsr requirements"). if on or before the expiration date, the holder (i) has sent the common stock warrant notice of exercise to the company, (ii) has irrevocably elected to exercise this warrant for the number of shares specified in such notice subject only to compliance with the hsr requirements, and (iii) the holder has not been able to complete the exercise of this warrant prior to the expiration date solely because of the hsr requirements, then, for so long as the holder actively continues in its effort to comply with the hsr requirements, the holder shall be entitled to complete the process of exercising this warrant for such number of shares in accordance with the procedures contained herein notwithstanding the fact that completion of the exercise of this warrant would take place after the expiration date. if an exercise by holder is subject to hsr requirements, the amount payable upon such exercise shall be paid to the company within five (5) business days of the holder's receiving written notice the expiration or notice of early termination of, or compliance with, all hsr requirements. (b) the company and the holder shall use all reasonable efforts to comply with the hsr requirements; provided, however, that neither the company nor the holder shall be under any obligation to comply with any request or requirement imposed by the federal trade commission (the "ftc"), the department of justice ("dofj") or any other governmental authority in connection with their compliance with the hsr requirements if the company or the holder reasonably determines that such compliance is unduly burdensome. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the company nor the holder shall be obligated to comply with any request by, or requirement of, the ftc, the dofj or any other governmental authority, that such party determines is unduly burdensome: (i) to disclose information the company or the holder, as the case may be, desires to keep confidential; (ii) to dispose or any assets or operations; or (iii) to comply with any restriction on the manner in which they conduct their respective operations. in the event that the company shall elect not to comply with any of the hsr requirements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall be 5 obligated to pay to the holder within sixty (60) business days following written election from the holder an amount equal to the difference between: (1) the market price as of the date of the common stock warrant notice of exercise, multiplied by the number of shares to which such notice relates; and (2) the per share purchase price, multiplied by the number of such shares. 2. adjustment of number of shares and per share purchase price. the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant, and the per share purchase price, will be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 2: 2.1 subdivision or combination of common stock. if the company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the per share purchase price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of shares of common stock obtainable upon exercise of this warrant shall be proportionately increased. if the company at any time combines (by reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the per share purchase price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of shares of common stock obtainable upon exercise of this warrant shall be proportionately decreased. 2.2 stock dividends. if the company at any time while this warrant remains outstanding and unexpired pays a dividend, without receipt of consideration therefor, to the holders of common stock payable in shares of common stock, preferred stock, other capital stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, preferred stock or other capital stock ("convertible securities"), or options to purchase common stock, preferred stock, other capital stock or convertible securities ("options"), other than any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to section 2.1 hereof, the holder shall, upon exercise of this warrant be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of shares receivable thereupon, the amount of common stock, preferred stock, other capital stock, convertible securities or options that such holder would have received had it been holder of record of such shares as of the date on which holders of common stock received or became entitled to receive such additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, other capital stock, convertible securities or options. any adjustment under this section 2.2 will become effective on the record date or, if there is no record date, on the date of issuance. 2.3 reorganization, reclassifications, mergers or sales. any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets or other transaction (including, without limitation, any corporate event (as defined in the investor rights agreement)), in each case that is effected in such a way that the holders of common stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets, or a combination thereof, with respect to or in exchange for common stock is referred to herein as an "organic change." prior to the consummation of any organic change, other than any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to section 2.1 or 2.2 hereof, the company shall, subject to section 1.2(c), make appropriate provision (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holder) to ensure that the holder shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive, upon exercise of this warrant in accordance with its terms and upon payment 6 of the per share exercise price then in effect, in lieu of each share of common stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of this warrant, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to each share of common stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the warrant had the warrant been exercised immediately prior to such organic change. the company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to such holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire. 2.4 certain events. if (i) any event occurs of a type that would have an effect on the rights granted under this warrant similar to the effect of any event described by the other provisions of this section 2 and (ii) such event is not expressly provided for by such other provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then an appropriate adjustment in the per share purchase price and the number of shares of common stock obtainable upon exercise of this warrant so as to protect the rights of the holder shall be made. 2.5 notices. (a) within ten (10) business days of any adjustment of the per share purchase price, the company shall give written notice thereof to the holder, setting forth and certifying in reasonable detail the facts causing such adjustment and the calculation of such adjustment. the company will give due consideration to, and consult with counsel regarding, any objection the holder may have to the matters described in such notice, and will make any corrections to such notice deemed necessary to conform with the terms of this warrant.

(b) by selling holders. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other holder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such holder within the meaning of the securities act or the 1934 act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such holder, partner or director, officer or controlling person of such other holder may become subject under the securities act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other holder, partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action: provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that the total amounts 11 payable in indemnity by a holder under this section 2.7(b) in respect of any violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by such holder in the registered offering out of which such violation arises. (c) notice. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 2.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, to the extent that representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the indemnified party under this section 2.7 to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnified party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 2.7. (d) defect eliminated in final prospectus. the foregoing indemnity agreements of the company and holders are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any violation made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement in question becomes effective or the amended prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to sec rule 424(b) (the "final prospectus"), such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any person if a copy of the final prospectus was timely furnished to the indemnified party and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the securities act. (e) contribution. in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the securities act in any case in which either (i) any holder exercising rights under this agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section 2.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section 2.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the securities act may be required on the part of any such selling holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 2.7; then, and in each such case, the company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its registrable securities offered by and sold under the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by and sold 12 under such registration statement, and the company and other selling holders are responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that, in any such case: (a) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such registrable securities offered and sold by such holder pursuant to such registration statement; and (b) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) survival. the obligations of the company and holders under this section 2.7 shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement, regardless of the expiration of any statutes of limitation or extensions of such statutes. 2.8 termination of the company's obligations. the company shall have no obligations pursuant to this section 2 with respect to any registrable securities proposed to be sold by a holder in a registration pursuant to section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 more than seven (7) years after the date of this agreement, or, if, in the opinion of counsel to the company, all such registrable securities proposed to be sold by a holder may then be sold under rule 144 in one transaction without exceeding the volume limitations thereunder. 2.9 no registration rights to third parties. without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the registrable securities then outstanding, the company covenants and agrees that it shall not grant, or cause or permit to be created, for the benefit of any person or entity any registration rights of any kind (whether similar to the demand, "piggyback" or form s-3 registration rights described in this article 2, or otherwise) relating to shares of the company's common stock or any other voting securities of the company, other than rights that are on a parity with or subordinate in right to the holders. 3. right of participation. 3.1 general. the investor and any majority owned subsidiary of the investor to which rights under this section 3 have been duly assigned in accordance with section 6 (the investor and each such assignee being hereinafter referred to as a "participation rights holder") shall have the right of first refusal to purchase such participation rights holder's pro rata share (as defined below), of all (or any part) of any new securities (as defined in section 3.3) that the company may from time to time issue after the date of this agreement (the "right of participation"); provided, however, that no participation rights holder shall have the right of participation with respect to any issuance of new securities that would result in less than a ten percent (10%) reduction in such participation rights holder's pro rata share. 3.2 pro rata share. a participation rights holder's "pro rata share" for purposes of the right of participation is the ratio of (a) the number of registrable securities held by such participation rights holder, to (b) the difference between (i) the total number of shares of common stock of the company (and other voting securities of the company, if any) then outstanding (immediately prior to the issuance of new securities giving rise to the right of participation), where for such purposes all warrant shares held by the investor and its majority 13 owned subsidiaries are deemed outstanding, and (ii) the number of dilutive securities (defined below) issued since the last notice date (defined below) excluding any maintenance securities (defined below) issued pursuant to the last maintenance notice. 3.3 new securities. "new securities" shall mean any common stock, preferred stock or other voting capital stock of the company, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase such common stock or preferred stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible or exchangeable into such common stock, preferred stock or other capital stock, provided, however, that the term "new securities" shall not include: (a) any shares of the company's common stock (and/or options or warrants therefor) issued to employees officers, directors, contractors, advisors or consultants of the company pursuant to incentive agreements or incentive plans approved by the board; (b) any shares of common stock issued under the purchase agreement, as such agreement may be amended; (c) the warrant or any shares of common stock issued upon any exercise thereof; (d) any securities issued in connection with any stock split stock, dividend or other similar event in which all participation rights holders are entitled to participate on a pro rata basis; (e) any securities issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any outstanding security if such outstanding security constituted a new security; or (f) any securities issued pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation or entity by the company by consolidation, merger, purchase of assets, or other reorganization in which the company acquires, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, assets of such other corporation or entity or fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of such other corporation or entity or fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity ownership of such other entity. 3.4 procedures. in the event that the company proposes to undertake an issuance of new securities (in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) that would result in a ten percent (10%) or greater reduction in the pro rata share of each participation rights holder, it shall give to each participation rights holder written notice of its intention to issue new securities (the "participation notice"), describing the amount and the type of new securities and the price and the general terms upon which the company proposes to issue such new securities. each participation rights holder shall have ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of any such participation notice to agree in writing to purchase such participation rights holder's pro rata share of such new securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the participation notice by giving written notice to the company and stating therein the quantity of new securities to be purchased (not to exceed such participation rights holder's pro rata 14 share). if any participation rights holder fails to so agree in writing within such ten (10) business day period to purchase such participation rights holder's full pro rata share of an offering of new securities, then such participation rights holder shall forfeit the right hereunder to purchase that part of its pro rata share of such new securities that it did not so agree to purchase. such participation rights holder shall purchase the portion elected by such participation rights holder concurrently with the closing of the transaction triggering the right of participation. 3.5 failure to exercise. upon the expiration of such ten (10) day period, the company shall have 120 days thereafter to sell the new securities described in the participation notice (with respect to which the participation rights holders' rights of first refusal hereunder were not exercised), or enter into an agreement to do so, within sixty (60) days thereafter, at no less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the price and upon non-price terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the participation notice. in the event that the company has not issued and sold such new securities within such 120 day period, or entered into an agreement to do so within sixty (60) days thereafter, then the company shall not thereafter issue or sell any new securities without again first offering such new securities to the participation rights holders pursuant to this section 3. 3.6 termination. the right of participation for the investor and each other participation rights holder shall terminate upon the first date that the investor and its affiliates (as defined in rule 144 under the securities act) collectively hold less than the number of shares of the company's common stock equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the number of shares of the company's common stock and other voting securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the date of closing of the purchase agreement minus 100 shares (such number to be proportionately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events). 4. right of maintenance. 4.1 general. each participation rights holder will, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section 4, have the right to purchase shares of common stock, voting preferred stock or other voting capital stock ("maintenance securities") from the company at the purchase price (as defined in section 4.3) following the issuance by the company of dilutive securities (as defined in section 4.2) that the company may from time to time issue after the date of this agreement, solely in order to maintain such participation rights holder's prior percentage interest (as defined in section 4.4) in the company (the "right of maintenance"). each right to purchase maintenance securities pursuant to this section 4 shall be on the same terms (other than price to the extent provided in section 4.3 below) as the issuance of the dilutive securities that gave rise to the right to purchase such maintenance securities 4.2 dilutive securities. "dilutive securities" means any common stock, voting preferred stock or other voting capital stock of the company, whether now authorized or not; provided, however, that the term "dilutive securities" does not include: 15 (a) any securities other than common stock, voting preferred stock or other voting capital stock (e.g., warrants or options to purchase common stock, preferred stock or other capital stock); (b) any shares of common stock issued under the purchase agreement, as such agreement may be amended; (c) the warrant or any shares of common stock issuable upon any exercise thereof; (d) any securities issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or similar event in which all participation rights holders are entitled to participate on a pro rata basis; (e) any securities for which the issuance gave rise to the right of participation (regardless of whether any such right was exercised); or (f) any securities issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any securities described in (d) or (e) above. 4.3 purchase price. (a) employee stock. to the extent that the right to purchase maintenance securities arises out of the issuance of dilutive securities to employees, officers, directors, contractors, advisors or consultants of the company pursuant to incentive agreements or incentive plans approved by the board ("employee stock"), the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the average market price (as defined below) of such maintenance securities over the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities. (b) other dilutive securities. to the extent that the right to purchase maintenance securities arises out of any issuance of dilutive securities other than employee stock, the per share "purchase price" of the maintenance securities shall equal the higher of (i) the weighted average of the per share prices at which such dilutive securities were issued, and (ii) seventy-five percent (75%) of the average market price (as defined below) of such maintenance securities over the thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the date on which the participation rights holder elects to purchase such maintenance securities. for purposes hereof, in the event that the issuance of any dilutive securities occurs upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities ("exchangeable securities"), then the per share price at which such dilutive securities shall be deemed to have been issued shall be the sum of (a) the per share amount paid upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, plus (b) the per share amount previously paid for the exchangeable securities (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar events). (c) market price. for purposes of this section 4.3, "market price" means, as to any maintenance securities on a given day, the average of the closing prices of such security's sales on all domestic securities exchanges on which such security may at the time be listed, or, if 16 there have been no sales on any such exchange on such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on all such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day such security is not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices quoted in the nasdaq national market as of 4:00 p.m., new york time, on such day, or, if on any day such security is not quoted in the nasdaq national market, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices on such day in the domestic over-the- counter market as reported by the national quotation bureau, incorporated, or any similar successor organization. if at any time the maintenance securities are not listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted in the nasdaq national market or the domestic over-the-counter market ("unlisted securities"), the "market price" shall be the fair value thereof determined jointly by the company and the holder. (d) consideration other than cash. in the event that dilutive securities or exchangeable securities were issued for consideration other than cash, the per share amounts paid for such dilutive securities or exchangeable securities shall be determined jointly by the company and the participation rights holder. (e) appraiser. if the company and the participation rights holder are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time with respect to (i) the market price of unlisted securities, or (ii) the per share amounts paid for dilutive securities or exchangeable securities issued for consideration other than cash, such market price or per share amounts paid, as the case may be, shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the company and the participation rights holder. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding on the company and the participation rights holder. the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be paid for by the company. 4.4 prior percentage interest. a participation rights holder's "prior percentage interest" for purposes of the right of maintenance is the ratio of (a) the number of registrable securities held by such participation rights holder as of the date of such maintenance notice (as defined in section 4.6) (the "notice date"), to (b) the difference between (i) the total number of shares of common stock of the company (and other voting securities of the company, if any) outstanding on the notice date, where for such purposes all warrant shares held by the investor and its majority owned subsidiaries are deemed outstanding, and (ii) the total number of dilutive securities issued since the later of the date of this agreement or the last notice date excluding any maintenance securities (defined below) issued pursuant to the last maintenance notice. 4.5 maintenance amount. a participation rights holder's "maintenance amount" with respect to any maintenance notice shall equal such number of maintenance securities as shall (upon purchase thereof in full by the participation rights holder) enable such participation rights holder to maintain its prior percentage interest on a fully-diluted basis. as an example, assume that the company had 10,000 shares outstanding, and the participation rights holder holds 20% of such shares (or 2,000 shares). the company first issues 400 shares to a third party ("issuance 1"), an amount insufficient to trigger a notice of issuance pursuant to section 4.6. the company then issues 4,600 shares to a third party ("issuance 2"), an amount sufficient to trigger a notice of issuance. the participation rights holder will have the right to maintain its 20% interest after considering issuances 1 and 2 and the new shares issued to the participation 17 rights holder. in this example, the participation rights holder will have the right to purchase an additional 1,250 shares, thereby resulting in the participation rights holder holding 20% of the securities outstanding (3,250 shares out of 16,250 shares). 4.6 notice of issuance. within fifteen (15) business days of each anniversary of this agreement, and within fifteen (15) business days of each issuance of dilutive securities which when cumulated with all prior issuances of dilutive securities since the later of (i) the date of this agreement, or (ii) the date of the last notice date (subsequent to which the participation rights holder has had an opportunity to purchase maintenance securities), results in a five percent (5%) reduction in a participation rights holders' prior percentage interest, the company shall give to each participation rights holder written notice (the "maintenance notice") describing the number of dilutive securities issued since such prior notice date and the non-price terms upon which the company issued such dilutive securities, and the maintenance amount of maintenance securities that such participation rights holder is entitled to purchase as a result of such issuances. 4.7 purchase of maintenance securities. each participation rights holder shall have sixty (60) days from the receipt of a maintenance notice to elect to purchase up to such participation rights holder's maintenance amount of such maintenance securities at the purchase price as defined in section 4.3 and upon the terms and conditions specified in the maintenance notice. the closing of such purchase shall occur within ten (10) days after such election to purchase. if any participation rights holder fails to elect to purchase such participation rights holder's full maintenance amount of maintenance securities within such sixty (60) day period, then such participation rights holder shall forfeit the right hereunder to purchase that part of its maintenance amount that it did not so elect to purchase. 4.8 termination. the provisions of sections 4.1 through 4.7 shall terminate with respect to the issuance of any dilutive securities by the company after the right of participation terminates. 5. rights in corporate events. 5.l corporate event. (a) a "corporate event" shall mean any of the following, whether accomplished through one or a series of related transactions (a) the acquisition of all or substantially all the assets of the company, (b) an acquisition of the company by consolidation, merger, share purchase or exchange, or other reorganization or transaction in which the holders of the company's outstanding voting stock immediately prior to such transaction own, immediately after such transaction, securities representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the corporation or other entity surviving such transaction, and (c) any other transaction or series of related transactions (excluding any exercise or exercises of the warrant) that would result in a greater than twenty-five percent (25%) change in the total outstanding number of shares of voting stock (as defined below) of the company (other than any such change solely as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or other recapitalization affecting holders of common stock and other classes of voting securities of the company on a pro rata basis). 18 (b) the company agrees that it will provide the investor with detailed written notice of any offer from a third party for a proposed corporate event within two (2) business days of the date the company first becomes aware of such offer or proposed corporate event. in addition, the company agrees that it will provide the investor, within two (2) business days of the company's becoming aware thereof, with detailed written notice of any offer from a third party to acquire ten percent (10%) or more of the company's outstanding voting securities. 5.2 right of first refusal the company agrees that prior to entering into any agreement for what would be considered a corporate event, the company will present to the investor in writing the final terms and conditions of the proposed corporate event, including without limitation the name of the other party or parties to the corporate event and a copy of the definitive agreements that the company is prepared to enter into (the "corporate event agreement"). the investor shall have ten (10) calendar days from the date of receipt of the corporate event agreement to deliver written notice to the company agreeing in writing to enter into an agreement with the company on substantially the same terms and conditions specified in the corporate event agreement, which agreement shall call for completion within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of delivery of the corporate event agreement (such 120-day period subject to extensions for regulatory compliance). if the investor fails to so agree in writing within such ten (10) business day period, for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, the company shall have the right to enter into the corporate event agreement with the party specified in such agreement. 5.3 termination of rights. the rights of the investor under section 5.23 shall terminate after july 13, 2000; provided, however, that the investor's rights under such sections of this section 5 shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any corporate event for which the investor has received, or been entitled to receive, notice from the company prior to july 13, 2000. 5.4 right of first negotiation. after july 13, 2000 and through july 13, 2004 (before july 13, 2000, the provisions of section 5.2 shall govern), prior to entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a corporate event, the company shall first attempt to negotiate in good faith with the investor for a period of not less than twenty (20) calendar days for the investor to acquire the company or enter into another corporate event with the company. during such 20-calendar day period, the investor shall be entitled to conduct due diligence with the reasonable cooperation of the company. to the extent that the company and the investor do not enter into an agreement with respect to such an acquisition or other corporate event with the investor during such 20-calendar day period, the company shall be free to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a corporate event with a third party and subsequently consummate such corporate event, provided that such definitive agreement is entered into within ninety (90) days following termination of such 20-calendar day period, and, provided further, that if during such 20-calendar day period, the investor shall have made a written offer for the acquisition of the company, the corporate event with such a third party shall be for at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the price offered by the investor and on other terms no less favorable to shareholders of the company than the terms of the offer proposed by the investor with respect to shareholders other than the investor. the investor shall reasonably cooperate with the company and other 19 persons to effect such corporate event with such third party and, if the investor votes in favor of such corporate event, shall comply with applicable pooling-of-interests restrictions. 6. assignment and amendment. 6.1 assignment. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (a) information rights. the rights of the investor under section 1.1 are transferable to any holder who acquires and holds at least 250,000 registrable securities (subject to appropriate adjustment for all stock splits, dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like where all holders of the company's common stock participate on a pro rata basis);

(c) rights of participation and maintenance. the rights of the investor under sections 3 and section 4 hereof may be assigned only to a subsidiary of which the investor beneficially owns, either directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the voting securities (a "majority owned subsidiary"); provided, however that no party may be assigned any of the foregoing rights unless the company is given written notice by the investor at the time of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the securities of the ;company as to which the rights in question are being assigned; and provided further that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. (d) rights on corporate events. the rights of the investor under section 5 hereof may be assigned only in whole, and not in part, and only to a majority owned subsidiary; provided, however that no party may be assigned any of the foregoing rights unless the company is given written notice by the investor at the time of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee; and provided further that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. 6.2 amendment of rights. any provision of this agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the company and investor (or, in the case of an amendment or waiver of any provision of section 2 hereof, only with the written 20 consent of the company and the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding and entitled to the registration rights set forth in section 2 hereof). any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this section 6.2 shall be binding upon the investor, each holder, each permitted successor or assignee of such investor or holder and the company. 7. confidentiality. 7.1 (a) except to the extent required by law or judicial order or except as provided herein, each party to this agreement will hold any of the other's confidential information (as defined in the next paragraph) in confidence and will: (i) use the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of the confidential information that the receiving party uses with its own information of like nature (but in no event less than reasonable care), (ii) limit disclosure of the confidential information, including any materials regarding the confidential information that the receiving party has generated, to such of its employees and contractors as have a need to know the confidential information to accomplish the purposes of this agreement, and (iii) advise its employees, agents and contractors of the confidential nature of the confidential information and of the receiving party's obligations under this agreement.

provided that nothing in this section 8 shall affect the investors rights under section 3 and section 4, and provided further that: (a) the investor may acquire voting stock without regard to the foregoing limitation, and such limitation shall be suspended, but not terminated, if and for as long as (i) a tender or exchange offer is made and is not withdrawn or terminated by another person or group to purchase or exchange for cash or other consideration any voting stock that, if accepted or if otherwise successful, would result in such person or group beneficially owning or having the right to acquire shares of voting stock with aggregate voting power of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total voting power of the company then in effect (not counting for these purposes any shares of voting stock of the company originally acquired ( where such shares or shares exchanged with the company in respect thereof, are still held) by such person or group from the investor or any majority owned subsidiary), and such offer is not withdrawn or terminated prior to the investor making an offer to acquire voting stock or acquiring voting stock; provided, however, that the foregoing standstill limitation will be reinstated once any such tender or exchange offer is withdrawn or terminated, (ii) another person or group hereafter acquires voting stock with aggregate voting power of more than ten percent (10%) of the total voting power of the company then in effect (not counting for these purposes any shares of voting stock of the company originally acquired (where such shares or shares exchanged with the company in respect thereof, are still held) by such person or group from the investor or any majority owned subsidiary), where such person or group files a schedule 13d (under the rules promulgated under section 13(d) under the securities and exchange act of 1934, as such rules and section are in 22 effect on the date hereof), or other similar or successor schedule or form, indicating that such person's or group's holdings exceed ten percent (10%); provided, however, that the foregoing standstill limitation will be reinstated once the percentage of total voting power beneficially owned by such other person or group falls below ten percent (10%); (iii) another person or group hereafter acquires voting stock that results in such person or group being required to file a schedule 13g, or other similar or successor schedule or form, indicating that such other person or group beneficially owns or has the right to acquire voting stock with aggregate voting power of more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of the company (not counting for these purposes any shares of voting stock of the company originally acquired (where such shares or shares exchanged with the company in respect thereof, are still held) by such person or group from the investor or any majority owned subsidiary);
