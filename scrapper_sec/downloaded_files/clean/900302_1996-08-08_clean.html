(a) pursuant to rule 13d-1(f)(2) promulgated under the exchange act, this schedule 13d is being filed by messrs. sillerman, ferrel and morrow (each a "reporting person" and collectively the "reporting persons"). the reporting persons are making this single joint filing because they may be deemed to constitute a "group" within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act and rule 13d-5(b) promulgated thereunder. each of the reporting persons disclaims (i) the existence of such a group and (ii) beneficial ownership of the shares of class a common stock held by the other reporting persons. (b)-(c) robert f.x. sillerman mr. sillerman is principally employed as the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of sfx broadcasting, inc. ("sfx"), a publicly-held corporation that is an owner and operator of radio stations and also serves as chairman of the board page 5 of __ pages of sillerman communications management corporation ("scmc"), a new york corporation which makes investments in and provides financial consulting services to companies engaged in the media business. mr. sillerman's business address is 150 east 58th street, 19th floor, new york, new york 10155. scmc is an advisor to the company on a fee basis. mr. sillerman holds (i) securities in his individual capacity, (ii) certain options through the sillerman companies, inc., a new york corporation ("tsc"), of which mr. sillerman is the controlling stockholder and (iii) certain escrow shares (as hereinafter defined) and series b convertible preferred stock through scmc, of which mr. sillerman is the controlling stockholder. michael g. ferrel mr. ferrel is principally employed as the president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the company. mr. ferrel's business address is one monarch place, suite 220, springfield, massachusetts 01144. mr. ferrel is, and has been since the company's inception, a director of the company. bruce morrow mr. morrow is principally employed as a radio broadcaster at wcbs-fm in new york, new york. mr. morrow's business address is 51 west 52nd street, new york, ny 10019. mr. morrow is, and has been since the company's inception, the chairman of the board of the company. each reporting person was a founder of the company.

(f) each of the reporting persons is a citizen of the united states. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the event resulting in this filing occurred on july 31, 1996 when 170,000 non-voting shares of series a convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "series a convertible preferred stock"), were issued to the reporting persons of which messrs. sillerman, ferrel and morrow received 120,000 shares (of which 40,000 page 6 of __ pages shares were issued to scmc), 40,000 shares and 10,000 shares, respectively. the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock was pursuant to a compensation plan approved by the company's stockholders. pursuant to the certificate of designation of the series a preferred stock, the series a convertible preferred stock is automatically convertible into an equal number of shares of class a common stock since the company achieved at least $5 million in broadcast cash flow (as defined in the certificate of designation of the series a convertible preferred stock) in 1995 and the closing sales price of class a common stock exceeded $7.50 per share for the thirty trading days immediately preceding such issuance. simultaneous upon the issuance of the 170,000 shares of series a convertible preferred stock such shares and the class a common stock into which such shares are convertible were placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement pursuant to which each reporting person shall be entitled to vote his shares of class a common stock and which such shares shall be released from escrow in five equal annual installments beginning april 30, 1997 (the "escrow shares"); provided that, in the case of messrs. sillerman and ferrel, they provide substantial services to the company during the preceding fiscal year and, in the case of mr. morrow, he is available to provide substantial services to, and serve as a director of, the company. reference is made to paragraph (5) of item 6 which is incorporated herein by reference. in addition to the escrow shares, messrs. sillerman, ferrel and morrow beneficially own 107,000 shares, 26,000 shares and 10,000 shares of class a common stock, respectively (of which 40,000 shares, 26,000 shares and 10,000 shares, respectively, are issuable upon the exercise of options which are currently exercisable). mr. sillerman also beneficially owns 360,000 shares of class c common stock, 133,334 shares of original preferred stock and 120,000 shares of series b convertible preferred stock (of which 40,000 shares are held by scmc). mr. sillerman acquired the 360,000 shares of class c common stock, on july 23, 1993, in connection with the formation of the company as follows: (i) 220,000 shares for $1,240,000, and (ii) 140,000 shares were issued along with $5,250,000 cash as the purchase price of two radio stations purchased by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. in connection with the formation of the company, mr. sillerman acquired 133,334 shares of original preferred stock on july 29, 1993 for $0.05 per share. mr. sillerman also has an interest in the shares of class b common stock held by mr. morrow. reference is made to paragraph (1) of item 6 of this statement which is incorporated herein by reference. mr. ferrel also beneficially owns 10,000 shares of class b common stock, 66,666 shares of original preferred stock and 40,000 shares of series b convertible preferred stock. in connection with the formation of the company, mr. ferrel acquired the shares of class b common stock on april 8, 1993 for $0.01 per share. mr. ferrel acquired the shares of original preferred stock on july 29, 1993, for $0.05 per share, in connection with his employment agreement with the company. page 7 of __ pages mr. morrow also beneficially owns 130,000 shares of class b common stock and 10,000 shares of series b convertible preferred stock. in connection with the formation of the company, mr. morrow acquired the shares of class b common stock on april 8, 1993 for $0.01 per share. mr. sillerman also has an interest in the shares of class b common stock held by mr. morrow. reference is made to paragraph (1) of item 6 of this statement which is incorporated herein by reference. all purchases of stock by the reporting person were financed with their personal funds unless otherwise noted. all shares of series b convertible preferred stock were issued to the reporting persons pursuant to a compensation plan approved by the company stockholders. item 4. purpose of transaction. as founders of the company, officers and directors of the company and as holders of all of the outstanding class b common stock, mr. morrow and mr. ferrel have controlled the company since its inception. as a founder of the company and the holder of all of the outstanding shares of class c common stock and of a majority of the original preferred stock, mr. sillerman has, since the company's inception, been in a position, under certain circumstances, to assume control of the company. the company was structured in such a manner so that mr. sillerman's other broadcasting interests, including but not limited to the radio stations owned by sfx, of which mr. sillerman holds a majority of the voting power and is chairman of the board and chief executive officer, would not be attributable to the company. at the time of the company's formation, the communications act of 1934, as amended, and the rules, regulations, orders or policies promulgated or adopted thereunder by the federal communications commission (the "communications laws") limited the number of radio stations which any entity could own to 12 fm and 12 am stations. those ownership limits were based on "attributable" interests, which for a corporation, included the interest of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, had the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation's voting securities. the company was structured in this manner in order to maximize its expansion opportunities. the voting rights and certain conversions features of the company's securities are as follows: pursuant to the company's certificate of incorporation, the holders of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the company's stockholders, with each share of class a common stock entitled to one vote and each share of class b common stock entitled to ten votes, except (i) the holders of class a common stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two directors, (ii) with respect to any "going private" transaction, described in rule 13e-3 under the exchange act, between the company and any of messrs. sillerman or morrow, scmc, and howard j. tytel, an executive officer of scmc, or any of their affiliates, the class a common stock and page 8 of __ pages class b common stock vote as a single class, with each share of class a common stock and class b common stock entitled to one vote per share and (iii) as otherwise provided by law. accordingly, upon consummation of the company's initial public offering of equity in 1993, solely by virtue of their holdings of class b common stock, mr. morrow and mr. ferrel held 54% and 4%, respectively, of the combined voting power of the company. pursuant to the company's certificate of incorporation, the holders of shares of class c common stock and original preferred stock do not have voting rights other than those required by applicable law. each share of class c common stock and original preferred stock is convertible into a share of class b common stock, subject to receipt of all necessary prior approvals from the federal communications commission, if any ("fcc approval") (a) after may 15, 1996, if the company is in default under any obligation for borrowed money or (b) on and after july 29, 1998, and (c) with respect to the original preferred stock (i) held by mr. ferrel, if mr. ferrel is employed by the company, and (ii) held by mr. sillerman, if mr. sillerman's services are available to the company through scmc. upon consummation of the company's initial public equity offering in 1993, if shares of class c common stock and original preferred stock were converted into class b common stock, mr. sillerman would have held approximately 61% of the combined voting power of the company. shares of class b common stock, class c common stock and original preferred stock are also convertible under certain circumstances into shares of class a common stock. reference is made to the second, third and fourth paragraphs of item 5 which are incorporated herein by reference. the communications laws were amended in february 1996 by the enactment of the telecommunications act of 1996 (the "recent legislation") which eliminated the limit on the number of radio stations that an entity may own nationally and generally liberalized the number of radio stations an entity may own locally and thereby essentially eliminated the concern of aggregating the radio station interests of mr. sillerman, including but not limited to the radio station interests of sfx, with the radio station interests of the company. in addition, since one of the conditions to convert class c common stock and the original preferred stock into class b common stock had occurred, i.e. the passage of time through may 15, 1996, an application for fcc approval was made and approved on july 1, 1996 which would permit mr. sillerman, subject to the expiration of any applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and certain contractual obligations, to convert his shares of class c common stock and original preferred stock into shares of class b common stock and thereby obtain approximately 50% of the combined voting power of the company, on july 29, 1998, or sooner, in the event that the company is in default under any obligation for borrowed money. page 9 of __ pages on april 15, 1996 the company, sfx and sfx merger company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of sfx ("acquisition sub"), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (as amended, the "merger agreement") pursuant to which it is contemplated that acquisition sub will merge with and into the company and the company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of sfx (the "merger"). mr. sillerman is chairman of the board and chief executive officer and controls a majority of the voting power of sfx. pursuant to the merger agreement, upon the consummation of the merger, the outstanding securities of the company will be converted into securities of sfx as follows: (1) each outstanding share of class a common stock and series b convertible preferred stock will convert into a fraction of a share of class a common stock, par value $.01 per share, of sfx (the "sfx class a common stock"), which are publicly traded on the nasdaq national market and (2) each outstanding share of class b common stock, class c common stock and original preferred stock will convert into a fraction of a share of class b common stock, par value $.01 per share, of sfx (the "sfx class b common stock"). the fraction of a share of sfx class a common stock or sfx class b common stock to be issued in respect of each outstanding security of the company will be valued at $12.00 per share determined by reference to the average trading price of the sfx class a common stock during a specified period prior to the merger, subject to adjustment in the event such trading price exceeds or is less than certain specified levels. in the event that the stockholders of the company fail to approve amendments to the certificate of incorporation of the company necessary to permit different classes of common stock to receive different consideration in the merger (with respect to voting rights) or the national association of securities dealers, inc. does not approve the issuance of additional shares of sfx class b common stock, then all stock of the company shall be converted into a fraction of a share of sfx class a common stock. the economic rights of each class of common stock of sfx are identical, but the voting rights differ. like mmr stock, the sfx class a common stock and the sfx class b common stock vote as a single class with respect to all matters, with each share of sfx class a common stock entitled to one vote and each share of sfx class b common stock entitled to ten votes, except: (i) in the election of directors, with respect to which the holders of the sfx class a common stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two-sevenths of sfx directors (or if such number is not whole number, the next highest whole number), (ii) with respect to any "going private" transaction between sfx and mr. sillerman, or any of his affiliates, in which each share of the sfx class a common stock and sfx class b common stock is entitled to one vote per share, and (iii) as otherwise provided by law. the consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including but not limited to, the approval of the holders of a majority of the company's outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock, voting together with each class entitled to one vote per share. page 10 of __ pages the merger agreement provides that mr. ferrel is to be named a director and chief executive officer of sfx at or prior to the consummation of the merger (the "effective time"). upon consummation of the merger, it is contemplated that the class a common stock will be (a) delisted from the nasdaq national market and (b) will cease to be registered under section 12 of the exchange act. the merger agreement attached hereto as exhibit 8 is incorporated herein by reference. each reporting person confirmed in writing to the company on april 11, 1996 (the "april letters") that he intends to vote in favor of the merger and against any competing transaction, should any such transaction materialize. the reporting persons collectively beneficially own approximately 13.3% of the voting power of the company considering the merger and 36.9% of the voting power of the company considering any competing transaction, including options exercisable within 60 days, the escrow shares and excluding any conversion of any class c common stock or original preferred stock in the event that the conditions to such conversion were satisfied. reference is made to the first paragraph of item 3 which is incorporated herein by reference. except as set forth above, the reporting persons have no current plans that would result in any of the actions set forth in paragraphs (a)-(j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. as of july 31, 1996 there were 3,229,890 shares of class a common stock outstanding, including the escrow shares. the percentage set forth in item 5(a) of this schedule 13d were derived using such number. as of such date, the company also had issued and outstanding the following securities: 140,000 class b common stock 360,000 class c common stock 200,000 original preferred stock 200,000 series b convertible preferred stock 1,826,110 class a warrants 1,840,000 class b warrants none of the reporting persons beneficially owns any class a warrants or class b warrants. certain of the company's stock is convertible into an equal number of shares of class a common stock pursuant to the company's certificate of incorporation as follows: each share of class b common stock and class c common stock automatically converts into class a common stock, subject to fcc approval (i) upon its sale or page 11 of __ pages other transfer to a person or entity other than an affiliate of any of mr. sillerman, mr. morrow, mr. ferrel, scmc and howard j. tytel, an executive officer of scmc, or (ii) if sold or otherwise transferred to such an affiliate, upon the death of the transferor. class c common stock is also convertible into class a common stock subject to fcc approval. the holders of class b common stock and class c common stock are contractually prohibited from transferring such shares in a manner that would result in such shares being converted into class a common stock and the holder of class c common stock is contractually prohibited from converting such stock into class a common stock prior to july 29, 1998. reference is made to paragraph (3) to item 6 which is incorporated by reference herein. pursuant to the company's certificate of incorporation, each share of original preferred stock converts into class a common stock upon transfer by mr. sillerman or mr. ferrel to an unaffiliated third party under certain circumstances. each of mr. sillerman and mr. ferrel have agreed not to transfer such shares in a manner that would cause the original preferred stock to convert into class a common stock prior to july 29, 1998. in addition, such persons are contractually prohibited from causing such shares to be converted into class a common stock. reference is made to paragraphs (2) and (3) of item 6 which is incorporated herein by reference. series b convertible preferred stock is convertible into class a common stock if the company achieves at least $10 million in broadcast cash flow in 1997 and
