third-party claim &#8221;), such indemnitee must notify the party from whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the &#8220; indemnitor &#8221;) in writing of the third-party claim no later than thirty (30) days after such claim or demand is first asserted (a &#8220; third-party claim notice &#8221;). a third-party claim notice shall state in reasonable detail the amount or estimated amount of such claim, and &#160; initials seller /s/ ag purchaser /s/ cd -17- &#160; securities purchase and sale agreement &#160; shall identify the specific basis (or bases) for such claim, including the representations, warranties or covenants in this agreement alleged to have been breached. failure to give a third-party claim notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. thereafter, the indemnitee shall deliver to the indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers received by the indemnitee) relating to the third-party claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney-client or any other privilege that may be available to the indemnitee in connection therewith. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; if a third-party claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor shall be entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof. notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) the indemnification threshold has been exceeded, (b) no claim for injunctive relief is being made against indemnitee, and (c) it is reasonably likely that the indemnitee will not suffer a loss in excess of indemnitor&#8217;s indemnification obligation hereunder, the indemnitor may elect to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnitor that is reasonably acceptable to indemnitee. if the indemnitor assumes such defense, the indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnitor, it being understood that the indemnitor shall control such defense; provided , that , indemnitee&#8217;s expenses of counsel shall be an indemnified loss for purposes of this article 9 if such counsel reasonably concludes that a conflict or potential conflict exists between indemnitee and indemnitor that would make separate representation advisable. if the indemnitor so assumes the defense of any third-party claim, all of the indemnified parties shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnitor in the defense or prosecution thereof. such cooperation shall include, at the expense of the indemnitor, the retention and (upon the indemnitor&#8217;s request) the provision to the indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. if the indemnitor has assumed the defense of a third-party claim, (x) the indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such third-party claim without the indemnitor&#8217;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (y) the indemnitee shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a third-party claim which the indemnitor may recommend and which by its terms releases the indemnitee from any liability in connection with such third-party claim without cost or expense and without any admission of violation, injunction or agreement to take or restrain from taking any action; and (z) the indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the indemnitee, enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of any judgment which imposes any expense, obligation or restriction upon the indemnitee or requires the indemnitee to admit or acknowledge to any fact or event, including any violation of law. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; other claims . in the event any indemnitee should have a claim against any indemnitor under this agreement that does not involve a third-party claim, the indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim to the indemnitor promptly following discovery of any indemnifiable loss, but in any event not later than the last date set forth in section 7.2 or 7.4, as the case may be, for making such claim (a &#8220; claim notice &#8221; and, together with the third-party claim notices, an &#8220; indemnification notice &#8221;). such claim notice shall, to the extent known by indemnitee at the time, state in reasonable detail the amount or an estimated amount of such claim, and shall specify the facts and circumstances, to the extent known by indemnitee at the time, which form the basis (or bases) for such claim, and shall further specify the representations, warranties or covenants alleged to have been breached. failure to give a claim notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. upon receipt of any a claim notice, the indemnitor shall notify the indemnitee as to whether the indemnitor accepts liability for any loss and shall make payment to the indemnitee within ten business days of receipt of such notice. if the indemnitor disputes liability and does not pay such indemnification claim within ten business days of such receipt, and indemnitor is ultimately determined to be liable for such indemnification, interest shall apply to the total amount of such claim at the highest legally permissible rate and shall be due and payable in addition to any claim for indemnification, which interest shall be calculated from the date of receipt of such claim notice by the indemnitor, and indemnitor shall furthermore be liable for any and all subsequent losses &#160;
