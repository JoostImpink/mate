------------------------- (1) the present principal occupation of all executive officers of intuit is with intuit. during the last five years, neither intuit nor, to the best of intuit's knowledge, any person named in this item 2 has been: (a) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors); or (b) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which it was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 15, 1996, as amended (the "plan") by and among the issuer, intuit, checkfree acquisition corporation ii, a delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer ("acquisition") and intuit services corporation, a delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of intuit ("isc"), intuit acquired the shares from the issuer in consideration for the merger (the "merger") of the issuer's wholly-owned subsidiary acquisition with and into intuit's wholly-owned subsidiary isc in a reverse triangular merger, pursuant to which the issuer acquired all of the outstanding stock of isc. the merger became effective on january 27, 1997 (the "effective time"). item 4. purpose of transaction the purpose of the acquisition of the issuer's shares was the merger of the issuer's wholly-owned subsidiary acquisition with and into intuit's wholly-owned subsidiary isc, in accordance with the plan. on january 27, 1997, the issuer's stockholders approved the terms of the plan. no approval of the plan was required by intuit's stockholders. on january 27, 1997, the sole stockholder of acquisition and the sole stockholder of isc each approved the terms of the plan. the merger became effective by the filing of a certificate of merger between acquisition and isc with the delaware secretary of state on january 27, 1997. prior to consummating the merger, intuit provided electronic home banking and electronic bill payment services and other related on-line services through its isc subsidiary. intuit concluded that it was in its best long-term interests to focus the efforts of its management on intuit's core business of developing and marketing "front-end" software products and services, rather than devoting substantial management time and effort to building isc's transactions processing business. accordingly, intuit elected to dispose of the isc business to checkfree in the merger in exchange for the shares in order to achieve this objective while retaining an indirect interest in isc's business through an ownership stake in checkfree common stock. (a) to account for its investment in the shares on the cost method of accounting, intuit must ultimately retain less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding -5- 6 common stock of checkfree. accordingly, intuit currently intends to meet this requirement by selling approximately 2,000,000 checkfree shares within several months following registration of the resale of the shares by checkfree under the securities act of 1933, as amended. such sales may be made through open market sales in accordance with rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, by the exercise of registration rights granted to intuit by checkfree in the merger (see item 6 below), through private sales, through broker-dealers, directly to one or more purchasers or otherwise. the exact number of shares to be sold, and the price or manner of such anticipated sales, has not been finally determined. further sales of shares may be made by intuit in the future, but no such sales are currently planned. intuit does not have any plans or proposals which would relate to or would result in the acquisition of additional securities of the issuer. (b) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries. (c) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or of any of its subsidiaries. (d) pursuant to the plan, for so long as intuit holds no less than 10% of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock, the issuer must permit one representative of intuit to attend all meetings of the board of directors of the issuer in a non-voting observer capacity. intuit has made no changes to the board of directors or management of the issuer and has no present plans or proposals to make any changes in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any changes in the number or term of directors or the filling of any existing vacancies on the board of directors. intuit may exercise its right pursuant to the plan to send its representative to meetings of the issuer's board of directors in a non-voting observer capacity. (e) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer. (f) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure. (g) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in changes in the issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person. (h) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in a class of securities of the issuer being delisted from a national securities -6- 7 exchange or ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association. (i) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in a class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). (j) intuit does not presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in an action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) as of the date of this statement, intuit beneficially owns a total of 12,600,000 shares of the issuer's common stock. the 12,600,000 shares of common stock beneficially owned by intuit on the date of this statement represent a beneficial ownership of approximately 23.3% of the issuer's outstanding shares of common stock, based upon the issuer's statement in its form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 1996, as amended december 9, 1996, that 41,450,064 shares of common stock were outstanding on november 6, 1996 (to which were added the 12,600,000 shares of common stock issued to intuit in the merger on january 27, 1997). (b) intuit has sole power to vote and to direct the vote of, and sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of, all 12,600,000 shares of the issuer's common stock which it beneficially owns on the date of this statement. (c) except as set forth herein, intuit has not effected any transaction in the issuer's common stock during the past 60 days, and, to the best of its knowledge, no person named in item 2 has effected any transactions in the issuer's common stock during the past 60 days. (d) no other person is known to intuit to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, any shares of common stock beneficially owned by intuit on the date of this statement. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer escrow agreement intuit, the issuer and key trust company of ohio, n.a., entered into the escrow agreement dated as of january 27, 1997 (the "escrow agreement"). pursuant to the plan and the escrow agreement, until the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger (i.e., january 27, 1998), ten percent (10%) of the shares (i.e., 1,260,000 shares) will be held in escrow as security for certain indemnification obligations of intuit under the plan. -7- 8 stock restriction agreement intuit and the issuer have entered into an amended and restated checkfree corporation stock restriction agreement dated as of september 15, 1996 (the "stock restriction agreement"). the stock restriction agreement restricts intuit's ability to sell and purchase the shares, solicit proxies from the issuer's stockholders and initiate or participate in any group which has the purpose of changing the control of the issuer. the stock restriction agreement will irrevocably terminate at the first time that intuit shall beneficially own less than ten percent (10%) of the issuer's outstanding common stock. under the stock restriction agreement, intuit may sell shares of the issuer's common stock: (a) to any "qualified institutional buyer" (defined as a person who, assuming such person's ownership of five percent (5%) or more of the issuer's common stock, would be eligible to file reports of beneficial ownership on schedule 13g as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") because such person fits the description in rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the exchange act (as such rule was in effect on september 15, 1996) so long as the qualified institutional buyer would own, after such purchase from intuit, not more than ten percent (10%) of the then outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock; except that, in the case of a sale in accordance with sections (c), (d) or (e) below and certain additional requirements, no restrictions under this section (a) will apply; (b) to any person who is not a qualified institutional buyer ("other buyer") so long as such other buyer would own, after such purchase from intuit, not more than five percent (5%) of the then outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock; except that, in the case of a sale in accordance with sections (c), (d) or (e) below and certain additional requirements, no restrictions under this section (b) will apply; (c) in compliance with sec rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"); (d) pursuant to underwritten public offerings of the issuer's common stock in which the parties have mutually approved the managing underwriters; (e) pursuant to offerings of the issuer's common stock that are not underwritten but are registered under the securities act pursuant to a shelf registration under rule 415 of the securities act that has been effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement described below; and (f) in any other manner that the issuer agrees to in advance in writing. pursuant to the stock restriction agreement, intuit has agreed that it may purchase shares of the issuer's common stock only where such purchase would result in intuit's -8- 9 beneficial ownership of not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the then outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock, except where intuit has received the prior written consent of the issuer's board of directors or the issuer's authorized representative; provided, however, that intuit may not hold more than the number of shares of the issuer's common stock issued to it in the merger so long as the stock restriction agreement remains in effect. under the stock restriction agreement, intuit agreed not to solicit proxies from the issuer's stockholders in opposition to any recommendation of the issuer's board of directors. further, intuit agreed not to initiate or participate in any group which proposes, without the support of the issuer's board of directors, any change in the control of the issuer, whether by tender offer, merger, or otherwise. in any event, intuit, itself, is permitted to make such an offer or proposal to the issuer's board of directors; provided, however, that any such offer or proposal by intuit shall be made on a strictly confidential basis and shall not be publicly disclosed without the prior consent of the issuer's board of directors. registration rights agreement intuit and the issuer entered into the amended and restated registration rights agreement as of september 15, 1996 (the "registration rights agreement") which provides, among other things, with respect to the shares the following (a) registration rights and (b) restrictions. as soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, the issuer is required to file a registration statement on form s-3 for a continuous registered shelf offering under rule 415 of the securities act (the "shelf registration statement") covering all of the shares. the issuer agreed to continuously maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement at all times until the second anniversary of the effective time of the merger. for as long as intuit may be an affiliate of the issuer as defined in the securities act, the amount of shares that may be sold by intuit in each sale of shares in reliance on the shelf registration statement, together with all sales of other shares of the issuer's common stock for the account of intuit within the preceding three months (excluding any sales of the issuer's common stock by intuit pursuant to demand registrations (defined below) or piggyback registrations (defined below)), shall not exceed the greater of (i) one percent (1%) of the shares of the issuer's common stock outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by the issuer, or (ii) the average weekly reported volume of trading in shares of the issuer's common stock on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through the automated quotation system of a registered securities association during the four calendar weeks preceding intuit's delivery to the issuer of the required prior written notice of a sale of shares in reliance on the shelf registration statement. shares sold by intuit in reliance on the shelf registration statement must have a minimum aggregate sale price of at least $250,000. for sales of shares in reliance on the shelf registration statement, intuit is required to bear all of its selling expenses and the fees and disbursements of counsel for intuit, while the issuer must bear all of the rest of the registration expenses. subject to certain limitations, intuit may also require the issuer to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to the shares (a "demand registration"). intuit may request only one demand registration per calendar year and must -9- 10 request that at least 20% of the shares issued to it in the merger be registered in such demand registration, except that (i) the first demand registration may be for such lesser number of shares as would reduce intuit's ownership of the issuer's common stock to less than 20% of the outstanding shares of the issuer's common stock, and (ii) if intuit is prevented by factors outside its control from registering the minimum number of shares required under the registration rights agreement, intuit may nevertheless register such lesser number of shares as it is able to register. intuit may request that the shares registered in a demand registration be offered by means of an underwriting. for an underwritten offering of the issuer's securities, the underwriters may reduce the number of shares to be included in the demand registration, but shall not limit the shares to be included by intuit unless all other securities are first entirely excluded. for sales of shares in reliance on demand registrations, intuit is required to bear all of its selling expenses and its "pro rata" share of one-half of the registration expenses. intuit's "pro rata" share is the percentage obtained by dividing the number of shares registered and sold by intuit in the offering by the total number of shares of the issuer's common stock sold in the offering by all parties other than the issuer. if the issuer proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act, it must give prior notice to intuit and permit intuit, subject to certain limitations, to include in such registration all or part of the shares (a "piggyback registration"). an underwriter may reduce the number of shares to be included in a piggyback registration, subject to certain limitations. for sales of shares in reliance on piggyback registrations, intuit is required to bear all of its selling expenses and the fees and disbursements of counsel for intuit, while the issuer must bear all of the rest of the registration expenses. for so long as it holds at least 5% of the issuer's outstanding voting equity securities and subject to certain other conditions, intuit has agreed, if requested by the issuer or the underwriters managing an underwritten offering of the issuer's securities, not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any of its shares without the prior written consent of the issuer or such underwriters for a period not to exceed 90 days from the effective date of such registration. the registration rights agreement will terminate (a) if all the shares issued to intuit in the merger have been registered and sold pursuant to registrations effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement or (b) after the fifth anniversary of the effective time of the merger (except that if the issuer deferred, pursuant to the registration rights agreement, a demand registration, then this date shall be extended by one calendar year for each such deferral). item 7. material to be filed as exhibits the following documents are filed as exhibits

however, that the surviving corporation shall have no rights under this section 1.06 in connection with any of holdings' assets, properties, services, businesses or properties. article ii conversion of securities section 2.01 conversion of securities of the company. by virtue of the merger and without the need for any action on the part of the holders of the capital stock of the company, at the effective time, all outstanding shares of the capital stock of the company (excluding shares held in the treasury of the company, which shall be canceled as provided in paragraph (c) below, and subject to section 2.05(c) hereof) shall be converted into the right to receive fully paid and nonassessable shares of parent common stock on the following basis: (a) merger consideration. the shares of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the company (the "company common stock") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into the right to receive 12,600,000 shares of parent common stock, subject to the potential adjustment set forth in section 2.02 hereof, as follows (the "merger consideration"): (i) 11,340,000 shares of parent common stock shall be issued to the sole stockholder of the company common stock at closing (as hereinafter defined); and (ii) 1,260,000 shares of parent common stock (the "escrow shares") shall be issued to the sole stockholder of the company common stock subject to section 2.03 below. upon any adjustment of the merger consideration pursuant to section 2.02, the number of shares of parent common stock that are escrow shares shall be reduced in proportion to such merger consideration adjustment (as hereinafter defined). if, prior to the effective time, parent recapitalizes through a subdivision of its outstanding shares into a greater number of shares, or a combination of its outstanding shares into a lesser number of shares, or reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of shares of other classes or series, or declares a dividend on its outstanding shares payable in shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into shares of its capital stock (a "capital change"), then the number of shares of parent common stock constituting the merger consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect each such capital change. 11 (b) company common stock. at the effective time, each share of company common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive that number of shares of parent common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the merger consideration by the number of shares of company common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. (c) treasury stock. at the effective time, each share of capital stock of the company that is then held in the treasury of the company (if any) shall be canceled and retired and no capital stock of parent and no cash or other consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor. section 2.02 merger consideration adjustment. in the event that, after the date of this agreement and prior to the closing, the company incurs, realizes, or otherwise experiences a material adverse change (as hereinafter defined) in its financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business (as defined herein), operations, or results of operations, then at or prior to the effective time, the merger consideration shall be adjusted as follows: (a) change notice. if parent believes that the company has incurred, realized, or otherwise experienced a material adverse change in its financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business (as defined herein), operations, or results of operations and parent desires a merger consideration adjustment (as defined below), then parent must prior to closing give holdings and the company written notice of parent's claim that such a material adverse change has occurred (the "change notice"), which change notice shall state with specificity the grounds on which parent contends that such material adverse change has occurred and parent's proposal for a merger consideration adjustment. parent may only make one (1) request for a merger consideration adjustment. (b) attempt to agree. following their receipt of the change notice, parent, holdings and the company will in good faith consider parent's assertions set forth in the change notice and will use their best efforts to in good faith reach a mutual agreement, as promptly as practicable, as to the amount by which the merger consideration shall be reduced by reason of the material adverse change described in the change notice (the "merger consideration adjustment"). in attempting to reach an agreement as to the merger consideration adjustment, the parties will consider, among other things, the extent (if any) to which the fair market value of the company has been diminished by the material adverse change described in the change notice. if parent, holdings and the company agree to a merger consideration adjustment, then they shall execute a written agreement to such effect (the "merger consideration agreement") setting forth the amount of the merger consideration adjustment they have agreed to. (c) dispute resolution procedure. (i) agreement on material adverse change. if parent, holdings and the company agree that a material adverse change in the company's financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations, or results of operations occurred after the effective date of this agreement and prior to the closing date (as hereinafter defined), but are unable to mutually agree in writing on the amount of a merger consideration adjustment within 12 ten (10) days after the date on which holdings and the company receive the change notice (the "receipt date"), then the amount of the merger consideration adjustment (if any) shall be determined in accordance with the appraisal procedure set forth in section 2.02(c)(iii) below. (ii) no agreement on material adverse change. if holdings and the company do not agree with parent's assertion in the change notice that a material adverse change in the company's financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations, or results of operations occurred after the effective date of this agreement and prior to the closing date, and parent, holdings and the company have not agreed in writing on the amount of a merger consideration adjustment within ten (10) days after the receipt date, then, within twenty (20) days after the receipt date, the parties shall submit to mandatory binding arbitration the sole issue of whether or not such a material adverse change occurred. such arbitration shall be conducted in chicago, illinois in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association then in effect, and shall be concluded within thirty (30) days to the extent reasonably practicable. the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, mutually selected by the parties, who shall decide only the issue of whether or not a material adverse change in the company's financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations, or results of operations occurred after the effective date of this agreement and prior to the closing date in the manner set forth in the change notice. the arbitrator's determination as to whether or not such a material adverse change occurred after the effective date of this agreement and prior to the closing date shall be conclusive, final, non-appealable and binding upon each of the parties to this agreement and judgment may be entered upon the arbitrator's determination in accordance with applicable law in any court having competent jurisdiction over the matter. in connection with the arbitration proceedings, the parties will be entitled to conduct discovery in scope, timing, types, and under such procedures as such parties would otherwise be afforded had the dispute or controversy hereunder been subject to the federal rules of civil procedure. if the arbitrator determines that no material adverse change occurred after the effective date of this agreement, then no merger consideration adjustment shall be made; and if the arbitrator determines that a material adverse change has occurred after the effective date of this agreement, then the amount of the merger consideration adjustment shall be determined by the appraisal procedure set forth in section 2.02(c)(iii) below (unless the parties otherwise agree in writing). the foregoing agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law. (iii) appraisal procedure. when the appraisal procedure set forth in this subparagraph is required to be used by the provisions of subparagraph 2.02(c)(i) or (ii), then the amount of the merger consideration adjustment shall be determined as follows. within twenty (20) days after the receipt date (or within ten (10) days after the completion of the arbitration referred to in section 2.02(c)(ii) if such arbitration occurs) (a) parent, on the one hand, and holdings and the company, on the other hand, shall each select one qualified appraiser (as defined below) (the "selected appraiser") to determine the amount of the merger consideration adjustment (if any) arising from the material adverse change set forth in the change notice; and (b) parent, on the one hand, and holdings and the company, on the other hand, shall each give the other written notice (the "appraiser notice") of the identity of their respective selected appraiser. parent's selected appraiser is sometimes hereinafter called the "parent appraiser" and the selected appraiser of holdings and the company is sometimes hereinafter called the "holdings appraiser." the company shall provide each side's selected 13 appraiser with full access during normal business hours to the company's facilities, products, personnel, books, records and financial statements (subject to the execution of reasonable confidentiality agreements by such selected appraisers) solely for purposes of assisting the selected appraisers in determining the amount of the merger consideration adjustment. each selected appraiser shall attempt to determine the amount of the merger consideration adjustment, which, for purposes of such appraisal, shall be the number of shares of the parent's common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount (if any) by which the fair market value of the company was diminished from the effective date of this agreement to the closing date as a result of the material adverse change described in the change notice, by (ii) the average closing price per share of the parent's common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market (the "nasdaq nm") for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the effective date of this agreement. within ten (10) days after a selected appraiser has been selected, the parent appraiser and the holdings appraiser shall each deliver to parent and holdings a brief written report (the "appraisal report") setting forth such selected appraiser's appraisal and determination of the amount of the merger consideration adjustment and, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to the amount of the merger consideration adjustment, the parent appraiser and the holdings appraiser shall select a third appraiser (the "determining appraiser") which shall also be a qualified appraiser. the determining appraiser will review the appraisal reports and the amount of the merger adjustment will be the amount set forth in the appraisal report which is, in the judgment of the determining appraiser, the most nearly correct; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is only one selected appraiser because parent, on the one hand, or holdings or the company, on the other hand, fail to select its selected appraiser, then unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to the amount of the merger consideration adjustment, the amount of the merger consideration adjustment shall conclusively be deemed to be the amount thereof determined by such selected appraiser in its appraisal report. parent, on the one hand, and holdings, on the other hand, shall pay the fees and expenses charged by such party's selected appraiser and shall share equally the fees and expenses charged by the determining appraiser. as used herein, the term "qualified appraiser" means an investment banking firm of national or regional reputation that is substantially experienced in representing and valuing software companies in underwritten public offerings and/or merger and acquisition transactions, provided that such investment banking firm and its affiliates do not have a family relationship, or a then-currently active significant business relationship with the party who selected such appraiser, or advised or represented any of the parties in connection with this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder. (iv) efforts to agree. nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the parties from further efforts to reach a mutual agreement on the amount of the merger consideration adjustment (if any) while the arbitration procedure and/or the appraisal procedure described in sections 2.02(c)(ii) and (iii) above is pending and any mutual written agreement reached by parent, holdings and the company regarding the amount of the merger consideration adjustment shall be the conclusive, final, non-appealable and determinative resolution of the amount of the merger consideration adjustment, binding upon each of the parties hereto. (d) material adverse change. as used herein, "material adverse change" means a material adverse change other than a change arising or resulting, directly or indirectly, from industry conditions or the public announcement of, or the response or reaction of customers, vendors, licensors, investors, company employees or others to, this agreement, the 14 merger, or any of the agreements or transactions contemplated by this agreement or entered into in connection with this agreement or the merger. (e) meaning of merger consideration. from and after the effectiveness of any merger consideration adjustment in accordance with this section 2.02, the term "merger consideration" as used in this agreement, shall mean the reduced amount of merger consideration to be paid to holdings as the sole stockholder of the company pursuant to section 2 of this agreement, as modified by the merger consideration adjustment. section 2.03 release of escrow shares. the escrow shares shall be released from escrow and delivered to holdings one (1) year after the closing date, subject to the terms of the escrow agreement (as hereinafter defined) and the provisions of article vii. the rights of parent and acquisition under article vii shall not be in any manner limited to the escrow shares, but shall be subject to the limitations set forth in article vii. section 2.04 conversion of acquisition common stock. at the effective time, each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of acquisition that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall remain outstanding and, by virtue of the merger, automatically and without the need for any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation. section 2.05 surrender and exchange of shares. (a) at the effective time, each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior thereto represented shares of the capital stock of the company shall surrender the same to parent or its agent, and each such holder shall be entitled upon such surrender to receive in exchange therefor, without cost to it, the number of shares of parent common stock into which the shares theretofore represented by the certificate so surrendered shall have been converted as provided in section 2.01 hereof, and the certificate or certificates so surrendered in exchange for such consideration shall forthwith be canceled by parent. (b) if a certificate representing shares of the capital stock of the company has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such certificate shall submit an affidavit describing the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the number of shares evidenced thereby and affirming the status of that certificate in lieu of surrendering such certificate to parent, which shall deem such certificate canceled; provided that parent may require the holder of such certificate to provide parent with a bond in such amount as parent may direct as a condition to paying any consideration hereunder. until so surrendered, the outstanding certificates that, prior to the effective time, represented shares of the capital stock of the company that shall have been converted as aforesaid shall be deemed for all corporate purposes, except as hereinafter provided, to evidence the ownership of the merger consideration into which such shares have been so converted. (c) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of parent common stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates held by stockholders of the company, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any 15 rights of a stockholder of parent. each holder of shares of the capital stock of the company who would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the merger a fraction of a share of parent common stock (after taking into account all certificates surrendered by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from parent at the effective time, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of parent common stock multiplied by the average of the per share closing prices on the nasdaq nm of shares of parent common stock during the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of this agreement. it is understood (i) that the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration; and (ii) that no holder of shares of company capital stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of parent common stock in an amount greater than the value of one full share of parent common stock. section 2.06 closing of stock transfer books. on and after the effective time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the company or parent of shares of capital stock of the company that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. section 2.07 closing. the closing (the "closing") shall be scheduled to occur at the offices of porter, wright, morris & arthur, columbus, ohio at 10:00 a.m. local time, on a date as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than the third business day, unless otherwise agreed) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to effect the merger set forth herein. the closing, and all transactions to occur at the closing, shall be deemed to have taken place at, and shall be effective as of, the close of business on the date of closing (the "closing date"). section 2.08 tax-free reorganization. the parties intend to adopt this agreement as a tax-free plan of reorganization and to consummate the merger in accordance with the provisions of section 368(a)(1)(a) of the internal revenue code by virtue of the provisions of section 368(a)(2)(e) of the internal revenue code. the parties believe that the value of the parent common stock to be issued to holdings as the sole stockholder of the company in the merger is equal to the value of the company common stock to be surrendered in exchange therefor. the parent common stock issued in the merger will be issued solely in exchange for the company's outstanding common stock, and no other transaction other than the merger represents, provides for or is intended to be an adjustment to, the consideration paid for the company's common stock. except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, no consideration that could constitute "other property" within the meaning of section 356 of the internal revenue code is being paid by parent for the company common stock in the merger. the parties will not take a position on any tax returns that is inconsistent with the provisions of this section. in addition, parent represents now, and as of the effective time, that it intends to continue the company's historic business or use a significant portion of the company's business assets in a business. concurrently herewith, and again at the closing, parent shall execute and deliver to holdings a certificate substantially in the form of exhibit a. the provisions and representations contained or referred to in this section 2.08 and in exhibit a shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. article iii 16 representations and warranties section 3.01 representations and warranties of holdings and the company. holdings and the company, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to parent and acquisition, except as set forth in the holdings/company disclosure letter dated of even date herewith that is being delivered to parent concurrently herewith (the "holdings/company disclosure letter"), as follows: (a) organization and qualification. the company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. the company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a company material adverse effect (as hereinafter defined). as used in this agreement, the term "company material adverse effect" shall mean a material adverse effect on the properties, assets, financial condition, operating results or business of the company, taken as a whole; provided, however, that the term "company material adverse effect" shall not include any such material adverse effect arising or resulting, directly or indirectly, from industry conditions or the public announcement of, or the response or reaction of customers, vendors, licensors, investors, company employees or others to, this agreement, the merger, or any of the agreements or transactions contemplated by this agreement or entered into in connection with this agreement or the merger.

(c) conditions to release of escrow shares. subject to the provisions of section 2(d) of this escrow agreement, in the event that intuit shall notify the escrow agent of its objection to the delivery of escrow shares to checkfree as provided herein, the escrow agent shall continue to hold such escrow shares until the earlier of: (i) the date escrow agent receives written instructions signed by both checkfree and intuit to deliver to checkfree or intuit, as applicable, a specified number of escrow shares (the "agreed shares"), upon receipt of which instructions the escrow agent shall deliver the agreed shares to checkfree or intuit, as provided in such written instructions; (ii) the date the escrow agent receives a copy of the award of the arbitrator as to the disposition of a contested claim as a result of an arbitration pursuant to section 3 of this escrow agreement; or (iii) the date escrow agent receives instructions pursuant to a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the disposition of such escrow shares; provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the provisions of section 2(d) below)), upon the first anniversary of the effective date of this agreement (the "release date"), the escrow agent will release from escrow to intuit the stock certificates for all of the escrow shares then held in escrow hereunder less (i) any escrow shares previously delivered to checkfree or awarded (but not yet delivered) to checkfree in satisfaction of a contested claim pursuant to an award of an arbitrator rendered in an arbitration pursuant to section 3 of this escrow agreement; and (ii) any escrow shares that are potentially subject to delivery to checkfree as a result of any then pending but unresolved arbitration of a contested claim pursuant to section 3 of this escrow agreement. any escrow shares held as a result of clause (ii) of this sentence will be released to checkfree or intuit, as applicable, in accordance with the resolution of such contested claim or claims by (i) an arbitration award of an arbitrator 4 in accordance with section 3 hereof; or (ii) a written settlement agreement executed by checkfree and intuit regarding the disposition of such shares as provided in section 3(l) of this escrow agreement. (d) intuit option to pay claims in cash. notwithstanding any provision of this agreement requiring or permitting checkfree to satisfy claims by obtaining the cancellation of escrow shares, if checkfree for any reason becomes entitled under this agreement to receive and cancel any escrow shares in satisfaction of a claim, then intuit, at its sole option and discretion, may instead elect to satisfy all or any portion of such claim with a cash payment to checkfree in lieu of such forfeiture of escrow shares (a "cash payment election"), in which case intuit shall, at least one (1) day prior to the date the escrow agent releases and delivers escrow shares to checkfree: (i) deliver to checkfree a check for the amount of cash equal to the number of escrow shares which checkfree is entitled to cancel to satisfy its claim times the average share price pursuant to such cash payment election, and upon receipt thereof, checkfree shall execute and deliver to intuit a written receipt for such cash payment signed by checkfree (the "receipt") and (ii) give written notice to the escrow agent of intuit's cash payment election and a copy of the receipt. upon receipt of the cash payment election and the receipt, the escrow agent shall retain, and not release to checkfree on account of such claim, a number of claimed escrow shares equal to the amount of the cash payment evidenced by the receipt divided by the average share price. checkfree shall cooperate with intuit and the escrow agent to facilitate intuit's exercise of the cash payment election. (e) recourse to escrow shares not required. nothing contained in this escrow agreement or in the plan shall be construed to require checkfree to seek recovery of a claim, in whole or in part, from escrow shares. checkfree shall have the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to pursue its rights under article vii of the plan without reference to such rights as it may have under this escrow agreement, as it may elect; provided, that (unless intuit consents otherwise), any claim by checkfree to recover escrow shares must be resolved by arbitration pursuant to section 3 of this escrow agreement or by a written settlement agreement executed by checkfree and intuit. 3. arbitration of contested claims. (a) contested claims. each contested claim for which checkfree seeks recovery from the escrow shares shall be promptly settled by mandatory binding arbitration as provided herein. the final decision of the arbitrator will be furnished to the escrow agent, checkfree and intuit in writing and will constitute a conclusive determination of the issues in question, binding upon checkfree and intuit. the escrow agent shall have no responsibility or obligation to participate in any such arbitration as a party thereto. (b) arbitration. each arbitration conducted pursuant hereto shall be conducted in chicago, illinois in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association ("aaa rules") then in effect. however, in all events, these arbitration provisions will govern and supersede any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the aaa rules. any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. 5 (c) compensation of arbitrator. any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will be compensated at a rate to be determined by checkfree and intuit or by the american arbitration association ("aaa"), but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon the rate of compensation. (d) selection of arbitrator. the aaa will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who are lawyers experienced in the representation of software companies; provided, however, that such arbitrator cannot be the legal counsel to checkfree or intuit and checkfree and intuit will each have the opportunity to make such reasonable objection to any of the arbitrators proposed by the aaa as such party may wish and that the aaa will select the arbitrator from the list of arbitrators as to whom neither party makes any such reasonable objection. in the event that the foregoing procedure is not followed, checkfree, on the one hand, and intuit, on the other hand, will choose one person from the list of arbitrators provided by the aaa (provided that such person does not have a conflict of interest), and the two persons so selected will select the arbitrator from the list provided by the aaa. (e) payment of costs. checkfree and intuit will bear the expense of deposits and advances required by the arbitrator in equal proportions, subject to recovery as an addition or offset to any award. (f) burden of proof. for any claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding. (g) award. upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a written opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached and will deliver such documents to each party to this agreement along with a signed copy of the award. (h) timing. checkfree and intuit will use their best efforts to conclude each arbitration pursuant to this section 3 within 120 days after the date of the giving of the claim notice giving rise to such arbitration. (i) terms of arbitration. the arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this escrow agreement or the plan. (j) exclusive remedy. except as specifically otherwise provided in this escrow agreement or the plan, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any contested claim that seeks recovery of escrow shares. (k) release of escrow shares pursuant to arbitration award. upon the arbitrator's issuance of a final award in such arbitration, the arbitrator will immediately deliver a copy of such final award to the escrow agent, checkfree and intuit. upon its receipt of a copy of the final arbitration award, the escrow agent will immediately release from escrow and transfer to checkfree for cancellation that number of escrow shares equal to the amount of 6 losses (as defined in article vii of the plan), if any, awarded by such final arbitration award, divided by the average share price. (l) settled claims. if a contested claim is settled by a written settlement agreement executed by checkfree and intuit, then checkfree and intuit will promptly deliver such executed settlement agreement to the escrow agent with written instructions signed by checkfree and intuit to release to checkfree for cancellation the number of escrow shares stipulated in such settlement agreement, and upon its receipt of such written instructions, the escrow agent will immediately release from escrow and transfer to checkfree for cancellation and/or transfer to intuit (as applicable under the provisions of such settlement agreement) that stipulated number of escrow shares. 4. termination; release of escrow shares to seller. this escrow agreement shall terminate upon delivery of all of the escrow shares to checkfree pursuant to section 2(b) or shall terminate and the escrow shares, or any balance of the escrow shares remaining after delivery of escrow shares to checkfree pursuant to section 2(b), shall be released and delivered to intuit promptly upon the later of (1) one year from the date of this escrow agreement, and (2) notification to escrow agent of final resolution of any dispute regarding delivery of escrow shares to checkfree pursuant to section 2(b). 5. liability of escrow agent. escrow agent shall not be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness or the validity of the subject matter of this escrow agreement of any part thereof, or for the identity or authority of any person executing any document in connection herewith. escrow agent shall not be liable to checkfree or intuit for any loss or damage if escrow agent acts upon any written notice or other written document which escrow agent, in good faith, believes to be genuine. the other parties hereto shall indemnify and hold escrow agent harmless against any claims, liabilities, or expenses arising in connection with the performance by escrow agent of its services under this escrow agreement, other than any grossly negligent or intentional breach of the terms of this escrow agreement by escrow agent. escrow agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the other parties hereto against any claims, liabilities or expenses arising in connection with the grossly negligent performance, or intentional breach, by the escrow agent of its obligations hereunder. 6. disputes. in the event of any disagreement between the parties to this escrow agreement resulting in conflicting claims or demands being made upon the escrow agent, escrow agent shall not be or become liable in any way or to any person for its failure or refusal to act, unless such failure constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct of escrow agent, and escrow agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from acting until (a) the earlier to occur of (i) the full and final adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of the rights of all interested parties, or (ii) final agreement among all of the interested parties which resolves all questions regarding any controversy among them with respect to their rights or obligations hereunder, and (b) escrow agent shall have been notified thereof in writing signed by all such parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction. 7. compensation. escrow agent shall perform the services required hereunder in consideration of its selection by the other parties hereto to hold the escrow shares and the stock 7 powers, and escrow agent shall receive compensation for its services from checkfree in accordance with the following: (a) an initial fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), which shall be due and payable upon execution of this plan, and a fee of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00), which shall be due and payable on each anniversary date of the effective date thereafter;

(b) underwriting. the registrable securities covered by the request may be offered by means of an underwriting if intuit so requests, and intuit shall so advise the company as a part of its request. if an underwriting is requested by intuit in its request, then intuit and the company shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the mutual agreement of the company and intuit; provided, that neither the company nor intuit shall unreasonably refuse to agree to a managing underwriter selected by the other, but shall in good faith attempt to select 4 mutually agreeable managing underwriters. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 1.2, if the underwriters advise the company in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten, then the company shall so advise intuit, and the number of registrable securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be reduced as required by the underwriters; provided, however, that the number of shares of registrable securities to be included in such underwriting and registration shall not be reduced unless all other securities of the company and any other selling securityholder are first entirely excluded from the underwriting and registration. any registrable securities excluded and withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the registration.

(ii) if the company, within ten (10) days of the receipt of a registration request of intuit under section 1.2, gives written notice to intuit of the company's bona fide intention to effect the filing, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request, of a registration statement with the commission for the sale of securities by the company (other than with respect to a registration statement relating to a rule 145 transaction, an offering solely to employees or any other registration which is not appropriate for the registration of registrable securities), in which event, (x) intuit shall be entitled to exercise its piggyback registration rights under section 1.3 hereof with respect to such registration, (y) the company shall be required in good faith to employ all reasonable efforts to cause its registration statement to become effective and to give prompt written notice to intuit if the company abandons its effort to file or causes its registration statement to become effective, and (z) in the event the company gives notice that it 5 has abandoned its registration statement efforts, the company shall promptly renew its best efforts to register the registrable securities that were the subject of intuit's demand registration request if so requested in writing by intuit within ten (10) days after intuit's receipt of notice that the company has abandoned its registration efforts; (iii) during the period starting with the filing of and ending on the date ninety (90) days immediately following the effective date of any registration statement pertaining to securities of the company (other than a registration of securities in a rule 145 transaction or with respect to an employee benefit plan), provided that the company is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective;

provided that the company may not exercise this right with respect to the registration requested by the first request if such first request is received by the company on or before march 1, 1997; or (v) unless at least one hundred and eighty (180) days shall have expired from the effectiveness of a previous registration of registrable securities pursuant to this section 1.2, or pursuant to a previous registration under section 1.3 below in which intuit was given the opportunity to include in such registration at least the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) of the registrable securities issued to intuit in the merger, or (ii) all registrable securities then owned by intuit. subject to the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), the company shall file a registration statement covering the registrable securities so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the request or requests of intuit. 1.3 piggyback registrations. the company shall notify intuit in writing at least twenty (20) days prior to filing any registration statement under the securities act for purposes of effecting a public offering of securities of the company (including, but not limited to, registration statements relating to secondary offerings of securities of the company, but excluding registration statements relating solely to any registration under section 1.2 of this agreement or any employee benefit plan or a rule 145 transaction) and will afford intuit, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, an opportunity to include in such registration statement all or any part of the registrable securities then held by intuit. intuit shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of the above-described notice from the company, so notify the company in writing, and in such notice shall inform the company of the number of registrable securities intuit wishes to include in such registration statement. if intuit decides not to include all of its registrable securities in any registration statement thereafter filed by the company, 6 intuit shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any registrable securities not included in such registration statement in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by the company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. if intuit is given the opportunity to include in any registration statement filed under this section 1.3 at least the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) of the registrable securities issued to intuit in the merger, or (ii) all registrable securities then owned by intuit, then intuit shall not make a request for registration under section 1.2 hereof for at least one hundred and eighty (180) days after the earlier of the termination of such offering or the effectiveness of such registration statement.

(b) by intuit. to the extent permitted by law, intuit will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, and any underwriter, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person or underwriter may become subject under the securities act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by intuit expressly for use in connection with such registration; and intuit will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of intuit, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that the total amounts payable in indemnity by intuit under this 12 section 1.7(b) in respect of any violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by intuit in the registered offering out of which such violation arises. (c) notice. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.7, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement of such an action and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.7, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.7. (d) defect eliminated in final prospectus. the foregoing indemnity agreements of the company and intuit are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any violation made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement in question becomes effective or in the amended prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to sec rule 424(b) (the "final prospectus"), such indemnity agreements shall not inure to the benefit of any person if a copy of the final prospectus was furnished to the indemnified party and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the securities act. (e) contribution. in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the securities act in any case in which either (i) intuit (and/or any officer, director, underwriter or controlling person who may be indemnified under section 1.7(a)), makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section 1.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section 1.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the securities act may be required on the part of intuit (and/or any officer, director, underwriter or controlling person who may be indemnified under section 1.7(a)) in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 1.7; then, and in each such case, the company and intuit (and/or such other person) will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in proportion to their relative fault as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that in no event (i) shall intuit be responsible 13 for more than the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of the registrable securities offered and sold by intuit under the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered and sold under such registration statement and (ii) shall intuit be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such registrable securities offered and sold by intuit pursuant to such registration statement; and in any event, no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) survival. the obligations of the company and intuit under this section 1.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement, and otherwise. 1.8 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, for so long as intuit owns any registrable securities, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act, at all times; (b) file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the 1934 act; and (c) so long as intuit owns any registrable securities, to furnish to intuit forthwith upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents of the company as intuit may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing a holder to sell any such securities without registration. 1.9 termination of the company's obligations. the company shall have no obligations to register registrable securities held by intuit (i) if all registrable securities have been registered and sold pursuant to registrations effected pursuant to this agreement, or (ii) after the fifth anniversary of the effective time of the merger; provided, however, that if the company defers a demand registration pursuant to section 1.2(e)(iv), then the expiration date under this clause (ii) shall be extended for one year for each occasion on which the company has exercised such rights. 1.10 preference to outstanding registration rights. the company has previously entered into agreements dated as of may 6, 1996 granting to certain holders of common stock of the company issued in connection with the acquisition of security apl, inc. registration rights with respect to such securities that provides, that until may 9, 1998, the company shall not enter into any agreement granting any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company registration rights with respect to such securities unless such new 14 agreement specifies that the rights of such holders under the may 6, 1996 agreements shall have preference to the holders of such new registration rights. accordingly, intuit acknowledges that its registration rights under this agreement are subordinate to the registration rights granted under the may 6, 1996 agreements. 1.11 limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of intuit, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company which would allow such holder or prospective holder (a) to include such securities in any registration filed under section 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 hereof, unless under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of his securities will not reduce the amount of the registrable securities of intuit which is included, or (b) to make a demand registration which could result in such registration statement being declared effective (i) during the effectiveness of any registration statement effected pursuant to section 1.2, or (ii) within one hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of any registration effected pursuant to section 1.2. 2. assignment. 2.1 assignment. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the registration rights of intuit under section 1 hereof may be assigned only to (a) a party who acquires a number of shares of company common stock equal to at least fifty percent (50%) of the shares of common stock that constituted the original number of registrable securities (as such number may be adjusted to reflect subdivisions, combinations and stock dividends of the company's common stock) or (b) any party who acquires ownership or control of intuit through a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or similar business combination; provided, however that no party may be assigned any of the foregoing rights until the company is given written notice by the assigning party at the time of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the securities of the company as to which the rights in question are being assigned; and provided further, that any such assignee shall receive such assigned rights subject to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, including without limitation the provisions of this section 2. 3. general provisions. 3.1 standoff agreement. intuit agrees, so long as it holds at least five percent (5%) of the company's outstanding voting equity securities, that, upon request of the company or the underwriters managing an underwritten offering of the company's securities, intuit will not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities (other than those included in the registration) without the prior written consent of the company or such underwriters, as the case may be, for such period of time (not to exceed ninety (90) days) from the effective date of such registration as may be requested by the underwriters;
