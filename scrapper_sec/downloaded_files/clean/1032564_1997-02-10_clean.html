(c) this statement is being filed by progressive food concepts, inc., a delaware corporation formerly known as hfmi acquisition corporation ("pfci"), scott a. beck and saad j. nadhir (pfci, mr. beck and mr. nadhir are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "reporting persons"). messrs. beck and nadhir each own on the date of this statement 48.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of pfci (the "pfci common stock). by reason thereof and, in the case of mr. nadhir, his position with pfci, each of mr. beck and mr. nadhir may be deemed a "controlling person" of pfci, and to have or share the power to vote and dispose of the class a common stock beneficially owned by pfci. mr. beck and mr. nadhir each expressly disclaim that they have formed a "group," as determined pursuant to section 13(d)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the securities and exchange commission thereunder, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of class a common stock beneficially owned by pfci. messrs. beck and nadhir have expressed their intention to transfer a portion of their shares of pfci common stock to other persons, who may include management and employees of pfci, employees of boston chicken, inc. ("bci") or its subsidiaries who become involved with pfci's business through arrangements between pfci and bci, area developers of bci, and other private equity investors in pfci. the identity of such transferees of pfci common stock and the amount to be transferred will be developed as the business of pfci and the nature of the involvement of specific individuals and entities evolve over the next twelve to eighteen months. messrs. beck and nadhir expect that such transfers will be at sale prices approximating their purchase price for such pfci common stock. pfci was incorporated in january 1997 for the purpose of engaging in the transactions described in this statement and has not engaged in any business since its incorporation other than that incident to its organization and such transactions. scott a. beck is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of bci, which operates and franchises retail food stores under the boston market(r) brand name. saad j. nadhir is the chairman, president and chief executive officer and a director of pfci. the principal business address of each reporting person is 14103 denver west parkway, golden, colorado 80401. appendix a attached to this statement and incorporated by reference herein sets forth with respect to each director and executive officer of pfci (except mr. nadhir), his or her: (a) name; (b) business address; and (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business, and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted. 5 (d) during the last five years, none of the reporting persons nor (to the knowledge of the reporting persons) any executive officer or director of pfci has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors). (e) during the last five years, none of the reporting persons nor (to the knowledge of the reporting persons) any executive officer or director of pfci has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction which resulted in a judgment, decree or final order (i) enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or (ii) finding a violation with respect to such laws. (f) mr. beck is a citizen of the united states. mr. nadhir and all other executive officers and directors of pfci are citizens of the united states. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration ------------------------------------------------- as more fully described in items 4 and 6 hereto, on january 31, 1997, pfci purchased from the issuer a warrant (the "warrant") to purchase 2,000,000 shares of class a common stock of the issuer. the purchase price paid by pfci for the warrant was $1,000,000 in cash. the principal terms of the warrant are described under item 6 below. the purchase price for the warrant was paid by pfci from the proceeds received by pfci from subscriptions by scott a. beck and saad j. nadhir for shares of pfci common stock. mr. beck and mr. nadhir each subscribed for shares of pfci common stock equal to 48.75% of the outstanding shares of pfci common stock (giving effect to the issuance of pfci common stock to the issuer as described under item 4 hereof), although messrs. beck and nadhir have expressed their intention to transfer a portion of their shares of pfci common stock to other persons, who may include management and employees of pfci, employees of bci or its subsidiaries who become involved with pfci's business through arrangements between pfci and bci, area developers of bci, and other private equity investors in pfci. the identity of such transferees of pfci common stock and the amount to be transferred will be developed as the business of pfci and the nature of the involvement of specific individuals and entities evolve over the next twelve to eighteen months. messrs. beck and nadhir expect that such transfers will be at sale prices approximating their purchase price for such pfci common stock. item 4. purpose of transaction ---------------------- on january 31, 1997, pfci entered into a series of agreements with the issuer that, among other things, (i) permit pfci to develop a business model based on the businesses of the issuer, including its harry's farmers market(r) and harry's in a hurry(r) retail concepts, outside of the states of georgia and alabama, (ii) provide for a five-year mutual consulting arrangement between the two companies, (iii) include an investment by pfci in the issuer in the form of a $20 million dollar loan described under item 6 hereof and the warrants, and (iv) include an investment by the issuer in pfci common stock. to effectuate the foregoing, the issuer transferred to a newly organized business trust (the "trust") certain federal and state registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, 6 registered and unregistered service marks, service mark applications, trade names, trade name rights, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary information of the issuer. the trust issued to the issuer two ownership certificates, one of which entitles the holder thereof to beneficial ownership of, and a license to use, the aforementioned intellectual property in the states of georgia and alabama and one of which (the "worldwide ownership certificate") entitles the holder thereof to beneficial ownership of, and a license to use, the aforementioned intellectual property throughout the rest of the world. the issuer then sold the worldwide ownership certificate to pfci for $1.5 million in cash and a number of shares of pfci common stock equal to 2.5% of the pfci common stock on a fully diluted basis, taking into account (i) all shares of outstanding pfci common stock, (ii) all shares of pfci common stock issuable upon the exchange or conversion of outstanding debt, stock or other securities of pfci and (iii) all shares of pfci common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options (other than unvested employee options), warrants or similar rights to acquire pfci common stock. the issuer also obtained certain anti-dilution rights with respect to the issuance in the future of additional pfci common stock. pfci, the issuer and harry a. blazer, the issuer's chairman, president and chief executive officer, entered into a consulting services agreement (the "consulting agreement") pursuant to which the issuer agreed to provide, for the period beginning january 31, 1997 and ending on january 31, 2002, certain consulting services and access to personnel, information and facilities of the issuer for the purpose of developing a business model based on the current businesses (and certain businesses related to the current businesses) of the issuer, including the creation of new organizational, systems, human resources, accounting and financial structures and models. a portion of the expenses of such development by issuer will be funded by the issuer through the development loan from pfci described below. in addition, pfci has agreed to make available its general business know-how and the information and know-how it acquires under the consulting agreement to the issuer during the term of the consulting agreement. pfci has paid the issuer a consulting services fee of $500,000 in connection with the consulting agreement. pfci and the issuer also entered into a secured loan agreement, described more fully under item 6 hereof, pursuant to which pfci has extended a loan to the issuer (the "refinancing loan") in the principal amount of $12 million, which loan was used by the issuer to repay certain indebtedness of the issuer, and committed to extend an $8 million loan (the "development loan") to be used for general corporate purposes and to fund development costs relating to the development of the issuer's business as contemplated by the consulting agreement. the purpose of the acquisition of the warrant was to permit pfci to obtain a substantial equity interest in the issuer in connection with the foregoing arrangements between pfci and the issuer. the warrant is being held by pfci for investment purposes, and pfci has no present plan to exercise such warrant (but reserves the right to do so at any time). except as set forth in this item 4, none of the reporting persons nor (to the reporting persons' knowledge and subject to the qualification set forth in the next paragraph) any of the executive officers or directors of pfci has any current plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d, 7 although each of the reporting persons and such executive officers and directors reserves the right to effect or seek to effect any such actions in the future. harry a. blazer, the issuer's chairman, president and chief executive officer, is a director of pfci. mr. blazer and an entity of which mr. blazer is the sole director and stockholder own shares of the class b common stock, no par value (the "class b common stock"), of the issuer constituting approximately 33% of the issuer's issued and outstanding common stock of both classes as of january 31, 1997 and possessing approximately 79% of the total voting power of the issuer as of such date. as a consequence, mr. blazer is required to file reports with the securities and exchange commission with respect to his beneficial ownership of class a common stock and certain other matters set forth in this statement, including in certain circumstances any current plans or proposals of mr. blazer which relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. insofar as this statement is required to contain information concerning mr. blazer, including any such plans or proposals of mr. blazer, the reporting persons have relied, and will in the future rely, on the information contained in such reports filed by mr. blazer with the securities and exchange commission, to which reference is made for a complete statement thereof. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer ------------------------------------ (a) the issuer has represented to pfci that there were 4,159,253 issued and outstanding shares of class a common stock as of january 31, 1997. pfci was the beneficial owner on such date of 2,000,000 shares of class a common stock (all of which are shares of class a common stock which pfci has the right to acquire within 60 days of such date). such shares represent approximately 32.47% of the issued and outstanding number of shares of class a common stock (including for this purpose shares of class a common stock for which the warrant is currently exercisable). such shares represent approximately 24.36% of the total issued and outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock of the issuer (also including for this purpose shares of class a common stock for which the warrant is currently exercisable). messrs. beck and nadhir each own on the date of this statement 48.75% of the outstanding shares of pfci common stock. by reason thereof and, in the case of mr. nadhir, his position with pfci, each of mr. beck and mr. nadhir may be deemed a "controlling person" of pfci, and to have or share the power to vote and dispose of the class a common stock beneficially owned by pfci. neither mr. beck nor mr. nadhir otherwise beneficially owns any class a common stock as of february 10, 1997. mr. beck and mr. nadhir each expressly disclaim that they have formed a "group," as determined pursuant to section 13(d)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the securities and exchange commission thereunder, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of class a common stock beneficially owned by pfci. messrs. beck and nadhir have expressed their intention to transfer a portion of their shares of pfci common stock to other persons, who may include management and employees of pfci, employees of bci or its subsidiaries who become involved with pfci's business through arrangements between pfci and bci, area developers of bci, and other private equity investors in pfci. the identity of such transferees of pfci common stock and the amount to be transferred will be developed as the business of pfci and 8 the nature of the involvement of specific individuals and entities evolve over the next twelve to eighteen months. messrs. beck and nadhir expect that such transfers will be at sale prices approximating their purchase price for such pfci common stock. as of february 10, 1997, mr. harry a. blazer, a director of pfci, beneficially owns 2,050,071 shares of class b common stock which are immediately convertible on a one-for-one basis into class a common stock, and mr. blazer's wife owns 31,000 shares of class a common stock, of which mr. blazer disclaims beneficial ownership. (b) pfci will have the sole power to vote, and to direct the vote of, and the sole power to dispose of, and direct the disposition of, any shares of class a common stock that may be acquired by it upon the exercise of the warrant. (c) during the past 60 days, the reporting persons effected only the transactions described in item 3 with respect to the class a common stock. to the knowledge of the reporting persons, no executive officer or director of pfci effected any transactions in the class a common stock in the past 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer ------------------------------------------------------ pfci and the issuer have entered into the following agreements with respect to securities of the issuer. warrant. the issuer has issued to pfci the warrant, which entitles pfci to purchase from the issuer at any time prior to january 31, 2001 up to 2,000,000 shares of class a common stock at the following exercise prices per share: (a) if the warrant is exercised in whole or in part prior to january 31, 1998, the exercise price shall be (i) $4.00 per share for the first 500,000 shares, (ii) $4.50 per share for the next 500,000 shares, (iii) $5.00 per share for the next 500,000 shares, and (iv) $5.50 per share for the next 500,000 shares. (b) if the warrant is exercised in whole or in part on or after january 31, 1998 and prior to january 31, 1999, the exercise price shall be (i) $4.50 per share for the first 1,000,000 shares, (ii) $5.00 per share for the next 500,000 shares, and (iii) $5.50 per share for the next 500,000 shares; provided that the number of shares purchased prior to january 31, 1998 shall (x) reduce the number of shares purchasable at $4.50 per share, and if greater than 1,000,000, (y) reduce the number of shares purchasable at $5.00 per share. (c) if the warrant is exercised in whole or in part on or after january 31, 1999 and prior to january 31, 2000, the exercise price shall be (i) $5.00 per share for the first 1,500,000 shares, and (ii) $5.50 per share for the next 500,000 shares; provided that the number of shares 9 purchased prior to january 31, 1999 shall reduce the number of shares purchasable at $5.00 per share. (d) if the warrant is exercised in whole or in part on or after january 31, 2000 and prior to january 31, 2001, the exercise price shall be $5.50 per share. the exercise price and/or the number of shares of class a common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant are subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments to the then applicable exercise price in the event the issuer issues class a common stock (or options to purchase, rights to subscribe for, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, class a common stock) for no consideration or for consideration per share (determined as provided in the warrant) less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance of class a common stock. loan agreement. the issuer and pfci are also parties to a secured loan agreement dated as of january 31, 1997 (the "loan agreement"), pursuant to which pfci has agreed to provide the following two credit facilities (the "loans") to the issuer: (i) the refinancing loan and (ii) the development loan. under the refinancing loan, pfci advanced on january 31, 1997 the aggregate principal amount of $12 million to the issuer, which amount was used by the issuer to repay indebtedness. the development loan obligates pfci, subject to certain conditions, to advance from time to time commencing on january 31, 1997 and ending on january 31, 2002, amounts requested by the issuer in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $8 million. proceeds of the development loan are to be used by the issuer for general corporate purposes and to fund expenditures in connection with the development of a business model for the improvement and expansion of the issuer's business and facilities. the loans are subordinated in right of payment to certain indebtedness of the issuer and are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the issuer and its subsidiaries. pfci has the option (the "option"), at any time after the earlier of (i) the acceleration of either of the loans or (ii) july 30, 1998 and up to the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the issuer commencing after january 31, 2002, to purchase that number of shares of series b preferred stock of the issuer at a purchase price equal to $40.00 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time to reflect any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of the issuer or in the case of certain mergers involving the issuer or the sale or conveyance of the issuer as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the "option price") equal to (a) $20 million divided by (b) the option price; provided, however, pfci shall be permitted to exercise the option to purchase shares of series b preferred stock of the issuer in excess of 300,000 shares only to the extent that pfci has initially funded the development loan (at a rate of one share becoming exercisable for each $40 of funding), unless such development loan was not funded due to a material breach of the issuer thereunder or under certain other agreements between the issuer and pfci. pfci is required to exercise the option for that number of shares of series b preferred stock equal to (a) $12 million divided by (b) the option price, not later than january 31, 2002, provided that at such time there exists no uncured event of default under the refinancing loan. the purchase price payable upon any exercise of the option will be paid by a contribution to the issuer of a principal amount of the loans equal to the purchase price, or 10 to the extent the principal amount of the loans is insufficient for this purpose, by delivery of cash. the series b preferred stock, stated value of $40.00 per share, ranks (i) senior to all classes of common stock of the issuer and to any other class or series of capital stock that does not expressly provide that it ranks senior to or on a parity with the series b preferred stock with respect to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively, "junior securities"), (ii) on parity with the issuer's series aa preferred stock, stated value $9.00 per share, and with each other class or series of the issuer's capital stock that expressly provides that it ranks on a parity with the series b preferred stock with respect to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively, "parity securities"), and (iii) junior to each class or series of capital stock that expressly provides that it ranks senior to the series b preferred stock with respect to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively, "senior securities"). the terms of the series b preferred stock provide that the issuer shall not (a) create, authorize or issue any senior securities or parity securities, (b) reclassify any class or series of its capital stock into senior securities or parity securities, (c) increase the number of series b preferred stock authorized for issuance, or (d) amend, modify or repeal its articles of incorporation, articles of amendment to the articles of incorporation, by-laws or any other specified designation, right, preference or power of the series b preferred stock in a manner adverse to holders of series b preferred stock without the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding series b preferred stock. the holders of the series b preferred stock will be entitled, at any time the issuer shall declare and pay a dividend or distribution with respect to any class of the issuer's common stock, to receive with respect to each share of series b preferred stock held, a dividend or distribution that is the same dividend or distribution that would be received by a holder of the number of shares of class a common stock into which such share of series b preferred stock is convertible on the record date for such dividend or distribution. in the event of certain defaults with respect to the issuer's series aa preferred stock, the series b preferred stock will become entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the issuer's board of directors out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends at an annual rate of 15% of the liquidation preference to which each share of series b preferred stock is entitled. each share of series b preferred stock will be convertible at any time into that number of shares of class a common stock obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate liquidation preference (as defined) of the shares to be converted by (ii) the then applicable conversion price (as defined). the initial conversion price is $4.00 per share and shall be subject to adjustment with respect to transactions occurring after january 31, 1997 (regardless of whether any shares of series b preferred stock are then outstanding) pursuant to customary anti- dilution provisions, including provisions that require adjustment to the conversion price in the event the issuer issues class a common stock (or options to the purchase, rights to subscribe for, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, class a common stock) for no consideration or for consideration per share (determined as provided in the series b preferred stock) less than either the conversion price or the market price (as defined) in effect immediately prior to such issuance of class a common stock; provided, however, no adjustment shall be made to the conversion price in the case of the issuance of (i) the warrant and certain other warrants issued 11 by the issuer, and the class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrant and such other warrants, (ii) the option, the series b preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the option and the class a common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion of all or any portion of such series b preferred stock, (iii) class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock originally issued to nationsbank, n.a. (south) and creditanstalt bankverein, and (iv) the series aa preferred stock of the issuer and class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such series aa preferred stock. the holders of series b preferred stock will vote with the holders of the class a common stock, the holders of the class b common stock, and the holders of the series aa preferred stock, voting together as a single voting group, on any matter required or permitted to be voted upon by the holders of the issuer's common stock. each share of series b preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof the right to such number of votes per share in each such matter as shall equal the number of shares of class a common stock into which such share of series b preferred stock is convertible as of the record date for the determination of holders entitled to vote on such matters. transaction agreement. the issuer and pfci are parties to a transaction agreement dated january 31, 1997 (the "transaction agreement"), pursuant to which the issuer has agreed that at any time the issuer desires to seek additional financing (whether debt or equity financing), the issuer agrees to negotiate in good faith with pfci for a period of 20 days with regard to any portion of the entire amount (at the option of pfci) of such financing prior to negotiating with any other entity with regard thereto. in the event the issuer has engaged in good faith negotiations with pfci and such negotiations have been unsuccessful, the issuer shall notify pfci of the existence of any other financing arrangement it proposes to consummate and the terms and conditions thereof and shall grant pfci a right of first refusal with respect to such proposed financing on the same terms and subject to the same conditions contained therein, in which event pfci shall have 30 days thereafter in which to agree to provide all of the financing on the same terms and conditions of such proposed financing. in addition, in the event pfci does not provide the financing as proposed by the issuer and the issuer enters into any financing other than a pure debt financing in which the debt instrument proposed to be offered has no equity-type features, the issuer shall grant to pfci a right to participate therein, on such basis as will permit pfci to maintain the same percentage equity interest in the issuer, on a fully-diluted basis, after such financing is completed as pfci had prior to such financing. the transaction agreement also provides that if at any time the issuer desires to sell substantially all of its assets, merge, consolidate or engage in any other business combination transaction (a "transaction"), the issuer agrees to negotiate in good faith with pfci for a period of 20 days with regard to any such transaction prior to negotiating with any other entity with regard thereto. in the event the issuer has engaged in good faith negotiations with pfci and such negotiations have been unsuccessful, the issuer shall make a final offer to pfci (the "final issuer offer") prior to engaging in negotiations with, soliciting offers from or accepting any offer of, any third party with respect to a transaction. in the event pfci does not accept the final issuer offer within 20 days after the date it is received by pfci, the issuer shall thereupon have the right, during the six-month period following the expiration of such 20- day period, to enter into an 12 agreement relating to a transaction (which transaction shall be consummated within the nine-month period following the expiration of such 20-day period) with any third party at a price and on terms no less favorable to the company than the final issuer offer. in the event the issuer does not enter into a transaction within such six-month period or consummate the transaction within such nine-month period, as the case may be, pfci shall again have the rights described above with respect to a proposed transaction. registration agreement. the issuer and pfci are parties to a registration rights agreement dated january 31, 1997 (the "registration agreement"), pursuant to which the issuer granted to pfci unlimited piggyback registration rights under the securities act with respect to the shares of class a common stock now owned or hereafter acquired by pfci or which are issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of any security of the issuer now owned or hereafter acquired by pfci or which pfci has the right to acquire, including preferred stock, notes or other evidences of indebtedness convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, class a common stock, and class a common stock issuable upon exercise of any warrant, and all other securities issued with respect thereto by reason of dividends, stock splits, combinations or similar transactions ("registrable securities"). in addition, the issuer is obligated to file, within 18 months after january 31, 1997, a registration statement under the securities act (the "resale registration") in which pfci will be entitled to include the registrable securities then held by pfci and that will permit pfci to make public resales of the registrable securities. the aforementioned 18-month period may be extended for an additional 12-months if the issuer has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm that, in such firm's opinion, the filing of such resale registration statement immediately prior to the end of the 18-month period might materially and adversely affect the issuer (including the price of the class a common stock). upon the effectiveness of the resale registration and for a period of two years thereafter, pfci has agreed not to effect the sale of more than 25% of the registrable securities beneficially owned by it on the effective date of the resale registration during any period of six consecutive months. the issuer will bear substantially all of the expenses in connection with any registrations under the registration agreement (other than underwriting discounts or commissions). mr. harry a. blazer is a party to an amended and restated stockholders' agreement dated january 31, 1997 among the issuer, mr. blazer and robert fleming nominees, ltd. and an amended and restated investors' agreement dated january 31, 1997 among the issuer, mr. blazer, axa equity & law life assurance society, orbis pension trustees ltd., ashford capital partners, l.p. and theodore h. ashford, each providing, among other things, that in the event mr. blazer sells or otherwise disposes of more than an aggregate of 10% of the class b common stock beneficially owned by mr. blazer, the other stockholders of the issuer that are parties to such agreement will have the right to include certain securities of the issuer owned by such stockholders in such sale or other disposition. none of reporting persons is a party to such agreements. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits

agreement"), between newco and creditanstalt-bankverein, as the agent (in such capacity and together with any successor agents, the "agent") for the lenders party to the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of december 30, 1994, or any agreement governing such refinancing indebtedness (such agreement as amended, supplemented or refinanced, the "bank credit agreement"), among the company, such lenders and the agent. any instrument, document or agreement evidencing or securing the loans, including, but not limited to, the notes, will on the date hereof or on the date of execution thereof, whichever is later, shall either provide by its terms, or 4 shall be inscribed with a legend indicating, that such instrument, document or agreement has been subordinated pursuant

shares of series b preferred stock of the company equal to (a) the maximum principal balance, divided by (b) the option price, provided, however, that newco shall be permitted to exercise the option to purchase the shares of series b preferred stock in excess of 3,000,0000 shares (adjusted in the same manner as provided in section 3.9(e)) only to the extent it has initially funded the development loan (at a rate of one share becoming exercisable for each $40 of funding) unless such development loan was not funded due to a material breach of any of the company's obligations to newco under the agreements entered into between the company and newco on january 31, 1997 (which breach was not cured pursuant to any applicable right to notice and cure). (b) newco shall be required to exercise the option and thereby purchase from the company, and the company shall be required to sell to newco, that number of shares of series b preferred stock equal to (a) $12,000,000, divided by (b) the option price, not later than the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, provided that newco shall not be required to consummate such purchase if on such date there exists any refinancing default unless such refinancing default is cured in accordance with the provisions of section 10.2 hereof, in which event newco shall be required to consummate such purchase upon such cure. (c) newco shall pay the purchase price upon any exercise of the option by the contribution to the company of a principal amount of the loans equal to the purchase price, and, to the extent the principal amount of outstanding loans is insufficient for this purpose, by delivery of cash. (d) upon exercise of any portion of the option under this section 3.9, newco's obligations to make additional advances to company under this agreement shall be reduced by an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid upon such option exercise. 5 (e) in case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of the company or in case of any consolidation or merger of company with or into any partnership, corporation, or other entity (other than a merger in which company is the surviving entity and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of the company, other than a change in number of shares of series b preferred stock of the company issuable upon exercise of the option) or in case of any sale or conveyance to any partnership, corporation, or other entity of the property of company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, then the holder of the notes shall have the right thereafter to exercise the option for the kind and amount of units and other securities and property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of series b preferred stock of company issuable upon exercise of the option immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale, or conveyance, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for herein. 3.10 obligations. subject to section 10.2 hereof, all advances made ----------- hereunder, and all interest accrued thereon, shall constitute one obligation of company with regard to enforcing the security interests granted by this agreement and by all other security interests, liens, claims, and encumbrances from time to time hereafter granted to newco by company. for all other purposes, the development loan and the refinancing loan shall be separate obligations. in the event newco makes one or more payments to a senior lender to the company to cure any payment default by the company, such amounts shall be considered advances hereunder, shall bear interest

credit resources sufficient to permit newco to necessarily make all requested advances under this agreement while maintaining sufficient working capital for newco's operating needs. company agrees that in the event newco shall fail to fund the loans as and to the extent required hereby solely as a result of the unavailability to newco of cash and/or credit resources to fund the loans and not as a result of any failure of company to satisfy the conditions precedent to advances or of the occurrence of a development default or event of default hereunder (a "funding default"), such funding default shall not (a) constitute fraud (by any person or entity, including newco and its successors and assignees) or (b) give rise to any liability of any person or entity (other than newco and its successors and assignees) in any other tort, and company further agrees that it shall be limited to its remedies in contract and in a non-fraud tort action against newco. newco and company agree that this section 3.11 shall not diminish or otherwise affect in any way the amount of damages for which newco may be liable to company in a contract or non-fraud tort action for a funding default. 6 3.12 payment method. all payments to be made by company hereunder shall be -------------- made in lawful money of the united states, in immediately available funds, without set off, counterclaims,

consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof; (b) when class a common stock is issued for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof as determined by the board of directors of the company (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), irrespective of any accounting treatment; provided, however, that such fair market value determined by the board of directors shall not exceed the aggregate current market price of the shares of class a common stock being issued; (c) in the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for class a common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for class a common stock, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities (other than in all cases, excluded securities): -4- (1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of class a common stock deliverable upon exercise of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for class a common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in section 2.5.1(iii)(a) and (b) above with the proviso in section 2.5.1(iii)(b) above being applied to the number of shares of class a common stock deliverable upon such exercise) received by the company upon the issuance of such options or rights, plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options

exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversions or exchanges thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration received by the company for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in section 2.5.1(iii)(a) and (b) above with the proviso in section 2.5.1(iii)(b) above being applied to the number of shares of class a common stock deliverable upon such conversion, exchange or exercise); (3) on any change in the number of shares of class a common stock deliverable upon exercise of any such options or rights or conversion of or exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, other than a change resulting from any anti-dilution provisions thereof, the exercise price shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price as would have obtained had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights or securities not converted prior to such change or options or rights related to such securities not converted prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change; and (4) on the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the exercise price shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price as would have obtained had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such options, rights, securities or options or rights related to such securities been made upon the basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of class a -5- common stock actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities. 2.5.2 adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, and stock dividends. in the event that the outstanding shares of class a common stock shall be subdivided (split), combined (reverse split), by reclassification or otherwise, or in the event of any dividend payable on the class a common stock in shares of class a common stock, the applicable exercise price and the number of shares of class a common stock available for purchase in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination, or divided shall be proportionately adjusted. 2.5.3 other distributions. if the company shall distribute to holders of the class a common stock shares of its capital stock other than class a common stock, stock or other securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends and distributions) or options or rights (excluding options to purchase and rights to subscribe for class a common stock or other securities of the company convertible into or exchangeable for class a common stock), then, in each such case, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such dividend or distribution shall be adjusted as follows. immediately following the record date fixed for the determination of holders of class a common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, the exercise price in effect thereafter shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be an amount equal to (i) the current market price of one share of class a common stock less (ii) the fair market value (as determined by the board of directors of the company, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) of the stock, securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, options or rights so distributed in respect of one share of class a common stock, and of which the denominator shall be the current market price. 2.5.4 adjustment for capital reorganizations. in the case of any proposed consolidation or merger of the company with another corporation, or the proposed sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets or any proposed reorganization or reclassification of the securities of the company, then, as a condition of such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holder shall thereafter have the right to receive upon the terms and conditions specified herein, in lieu of the warrant shares immediately theretofore purchasable hereunder, such shares of stock or securities or assets (including cash) as may by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the warrant shares purchasable hereunder immediately before such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification as if this warrant had theretofore been exercised. the company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor corporation or purchaser shall assume by written instrument the obligation to deliver to the holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as the holder is entitled to receive hereunder. 2.5.5 certificate as to adjustments. whenever the exercise price shall be adjusted as provided in this section 2.5, the company shall prepare a

date such dividend, subdivision, split, combination or distribution is made, and shall become effective at the opening of business on the business day next following the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such dividend, subdivision, split, combination or distribution. 2.5.7 notice of certain proposed actions. in the event the company shall propose to take any action of the types described in sections 2.5.2 or 2.5.3 the company shall forward, at the same time and in the same manner, to the holder such notice, if any, that the company shall give to the holders of capital stock of the company. failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action. 2.5.8 exercise after record date. whenever the provisions of this section 2.5 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for an event and the holder exercises its warrant after such record date and before the occurrence of such event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder the additional shares of class a common stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of class a common stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment; provided, however, that the company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. 2.5.9 treasury shares. the sale or other disposition of any class a common stock theretofore held in the treasury of the company shall be deemed to be an issuance thereof. section 3.

directors in accordance with (s) 14-2-602 of the georgia business corporation code. 3. on january 30, 1997, the board of directors of the company duly adopted an amendment to the company's articles of incorporation designating a series of preferred stock as the series b preferred stock, and determining the terms of such series. 4. the text of the amendment so adopted, which amends article ii by adding a new section g, is as follows. g. series b preferred stock 1. general. there is designated herein a single series of preferred stock having the preferences, limitations, and relative rights set forth below. the series b preferred stock shall be issuable upon the exercise of certain option rights issued by the company on january 31, 1997 (the "option issuance date"). capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned by section 10. 2. designation. the series of preferred stock shall be designated as the "series b preferred stock." the number of shares constituting such series shall be 500,000, having a stated value of $40.00 per share. all shares of series b preferred stock shall be identical with each other in all respects. 3. rank. the series b preferred stock shall rank, with respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, dissolution and winding-up of the affairs of the company: 1 (i) senior to all classes or series of common stock of the company and to any other class or series of capital stock that does not expressly provide that it ranks senior to or on a parity with the series b preferred stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively referred to as "junior securities"); (ii) on parity with the series aa preferred stock, stated value $9.00 (the "series aa preferred stock"), of the company, and with each other class or series of capital stock that expressly provides that it ranks on a parity with the series b preferred stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively referred to as "parity securities"); and (iii) junior to each class or series of capital stock which expressly provides that it ranks senior to the series b preferred stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up (collectively referred to as "senior securities"). the company shall not create, authorize or issue any senior securities or parity securities or reclassify any class or series of capital stock into senior securities or parity securities, without the approvals required by section 8 hereof. 4. dividends. 4.1 amount and payment. if the company shall at any time or from time to time declare, order, pay, or make a dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, securities, rights to purchase securities, or other property) with respect to its common stock, the holders of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of series b preferred stock held, a dividend or distribution that is the same dividend or distribution that would be received by a holder of the number of shares of class a common stock into which such share of series b preferred stock is convertible under section 9 on the record date for such dividend or distribution. any such dividend or distribution shall be declared, ordered, paid, or made on the series b preferred stock at the same time such dividend or distribution is declared, ordered, paid, or made on the common stock. 4.2 cumulative default dividends. beginning on the date of any redemption default applicable to the series aa preferred stock, and until such redemption default has been cured in full by the company and all dividends provided by this section 4.2 have been paid in full, the holders of outstanding shares of series b preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cash dividends at the annual rate equal to fifteen percent of the liquidation preference. all dividends shall be cumulative and shall be payable in equal quarterly installments in arrears on each dividend payment date commencing on the first dividend payment date for which the dividend record date occurs after the redemption default date, in preference to and with priority over dividends on junior securities. the dividend payable on any 2 share of series b preferred stock on any dividend payment date in respect of the quarterly dividend period then ended shall be calculated by multiplying the liquidation preference of such share on the immediately preceding dividend payment date (after giving effect to any dividend payment actually made on such preceding dividend payment date, if any) by 3.75 percent. dividends per share of series b preferred stock payable in respect of the initial dividend period shall be equal to the product of the liquidation preference and 3.75 percent times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the initial dividend period and denominator of which is 90. the amount of dividends accrued on the series b preferred stock for any period less than a full quarterly dividend period shall be equal to a pro rata portion of the total dividend payable for the quarterly dividend period during which such period occurs, based on the actual number of days elapsed in such period for which payable and the total number of days in the applicable quarterly dividend period. dividends shall accrue on a daily basis during each dividend period as provided above, and the liquidation preference of each outstanding share of series b preferred stock shall be correspondingly increased on a daily basis. each such dividend shall be payable to holders of record as their names shall appear on the stock books of the company on the dividend record date for such dividends, except that dividends in arrears for any past payment date may be declared and paid at any time without reference to such regular dividend payment date to holders of record on such date not more than 60 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of payment as shall be determined by the board of directors. 4.3 limitation on dividends, repurchases and redemptions. so long as any shares of series b preferred stock shall be outstanding, the company shall not declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions on any junior securities, whether in cash, property or otherwise (other than dividends or distributions payable in shares of the class or series upon which such dividends or distributions are declared or paid), nor shall the company or any of its subsidiaries purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for any consideration or make payment on account of the purchase, redemption, or other retirement of any parity securities or junior securities, nor shall any monies be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of any parity securities or junior securities, unless with respect to all of the foregoing all dividends or other distributions to which the holders of series b preferred stock shall have been entitled, pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof, shall have been paid or declared and a sum of money has been set apart for the full payment thereof. 4.4 pro rata payments. all dividends paid with respect to shares of the series b preferred stock shall be paid pro rata to the holders entitled thereto. 5. liquidation preference. 5.1 amount. upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the company, the holders of series b preferred stock will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the company available for distribution to the holders of its capital stock, whether such assets are capital or surplus, an amount in cash equal to the liquidation preference determined as of the date of such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or 3 winding-up, before any payment or other distribution is made on any junior securities, including common stock of the company. holders of series b preferred stock shall not be entitled to any other distribution in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the company. 5.2 proration. if upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the company, the assets of the company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference payable to the holders of outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock and all parity securities, then the holders of all such shares shall share equally and ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidation preference determined as of the date of such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, to which they are entitled. 5.3 sale not liquidation. for the purposes of this section 5 only, neither the sale, lease, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property or assets of the company nor the consolidation or merger of the company with or into one or more corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the company. 6. [reserved.] 7. certain repurchases 7.1 repurchase of series b preferred stock by the company. neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries shall repurchase any outstanding shares of series b preferred stock unless the company on the same terms either (i) offers to purchase all of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred stock or (ii) offers to purchase shares of series b preferred stock from the holders in proportion to the respective number of shares of series b preferred stock held by each holder. in any such repurchase by the company, if all shares of series b preferred stock are not being repurchased, then the number of shares of series b preferred stock to be repurchased shall be allocated among all shares of series b preferred stock held by holders which accept the company's repurchase offer so that the shares of series b preferred stock are repurchased from such holders in proportion to the respective number of shares of series b preferred held by each such holder which accepts the company's offer (or in such other proportion as agreed by all such holders who accept the company's offer). nothing in this section 7 shall obligate a holder of shares of series b preferred stock to accept the company's repurchase offer. 4 8. voting rights 8.1 general. 8.1.1 holders of series b preferred stock shall be permitted to vote with the holders of common stock and the holders of the series aa preferred stock, voting together as a single voting group, on any matter required or permitted to be voted upon by the holders of common stock. each share of series b preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to such number of votes per share in each such matter as shall equal the number of shares of class a common stock (including fractions of a share) into which each share of series b preferred stock is convertible as of the record date for the determination of holders entitled to vote on such matters. 8.1.2 notwithstanding the foregoing, without the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of series b preferred stock then outstanding, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as a single voting group, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at an annual or special meeting called for the purpose, the company will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to: a. issue any

purposes of exercising any vote, election or consent hereunder or under applicable law, shares of series b preferred stock held by the company or any of its subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be outstanding and shall not be counted in determining the outcome of any such vote, election or consent solicitation. 9. conversion. 9.1 conversion ratio. the shares of series b preferred stock shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of class a common stock obtained by 5 dividing (i) the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares to be converted, by (ii) the conversion price, subject to adjustment of such number of shares as provided herein. the initial conversion price shall be $4.00 per share, adjusted as provided in this section 9 for events occurring from and after the option issuance date. 9.2 reserved shares. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of class a common stock for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of shares of series b preferred stock, a sufficient number of such shares and shall take all action necessary so that shares of class a common stock so issued will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 9.3 changes in common stock. upon any change in the class a common stock after the option issuance date by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, stock splits, reverse stock splits, recapitalization, exchanges of shares or the like, the number of shares of class a common stock that a holder of series b preferred stock is entitled to receive upon conversion shall be adjusted proportionately. 9.4 recapitalizations, reorganizations, etc. if the company shall effect any capital reorganization or reclassification of its class a common stock (other than changes in par value or as a result of a change described in section 9.3 above) or shall consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation (other than where the company is the surviving corporation and each share of class a common stock outstanding immediately prior to such consolidation or merger is to remain outstanding immediately after such consolidation or merger) or shall sell or transfer all or substantially all its assets to any other corporation for a consideration consisting in whole or in part of equity securities of such other corporation, lawful provision shall be made as a part of the terms of such transaction whereby the holders of shares of the series b preferred stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in lieu of each share of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares immediately prior to such consummation, the same kind and amount of stock (or other securities, cash or property, if any) as may be issuable or distributable in connection with such transaction with respect to each outstanding share of class a common stock subject to adjustments for subsequent stock dividends and distributions, subdivisions or combinations of shares, capital reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations or mergers as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this section 9, as would have been distributed to a holder of series b preferred stock upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger had such holder converted such series b preferred stock immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger. 9.5 mechanics of conversion. each holder of series b preferred stock that desires to convert the same into shares of class a common stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the principal office of the company or of any transfer agent for the series b preferred stock or class a common stock, accompanied by written notice to the company that such holder elects to convert the same and stating therein the number of shares of series b preferred stock being converted and setting forth the name or names in which 6 such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of class a common stock to be issued if such name or names shall be different than that of such holder. in case such notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance and delivery of shares of class a common stock in such name or names. thereupon, the company shall issue and deliver at such office on the fifth (5th) succeeding business day (unless such conversion is in connection with an underwritten public offering of class a common stock, in which event concurrently with such conversion) to such holder or on such holder's written order, (i) a certificate or certificates for the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of class a common stock to which such holder is entitled and (ii) if less than the full number of shares of series b preferred stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate of certificates are being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares converted. each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares to be converted (except that if such conversion is in connection with an underwritten public offering of class a common stock, then such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected upon such surrender) so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease at such time except for the right to receive shares of class a common stock and accrued but unpaid dividends in accordance herewith, and the person entitled to receive the shares of class a common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of class a common stock at such time. 9.6 conditional conversion. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if conversion of any shares of series b preferred stock is to be made in connection with a public offering of class a common stock or any transaction described in section 9.4 hereof, the conversion of any shares of series b preferred stock may, at the election of the holder thereof, be conditioned upon the consummation of the public offering or such transaction, in which case such conversion shall not be deemed to be effective until the consummation of such public offering or transaction. 9.7 adjustment of the conversion price. the conversion price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: 9.7.1 pre-issuance adjustment. adjustments to the conversion price will be made for the events described in this section 9.7 occurring after the option issuance date, even if such events occur prior to the issuance of any series b preferred stock pursuant to the option (as defined in section 9.7.8 herein). 9.7.2 issuance of additional shares of stock. if at any time the company shall (except as hereinafter provided) issue or sell any additional shares of stock either (a) in exchange for consideration in an amount per additional share of stock less than the conversion 7 price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock or (b) in exchange for consideration in an amount per additional share of stock less than the market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock, then the conversion price as to the class a common stock into which the series b preferred stock is convertible immediately prior to such adjustment shall be adjusted to equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction, of which (x) the numerator shall be (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock plus (2) the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate amount of consideration, if any, received by the company for the total number of such additional shares of stock so issued or sold would purchase at the greater of (i) the market price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock or (ii) the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock, and (y) the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale of additional shares of stock; provided, however, that such adjustment shall be made only if the conversion price determined from such adjustment shall be less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares of stock. the provisions of this section 9.7.2 shall not apply to any issuance of additional shares of stock for which an adjustment is provided under section 9.7.2 or which are dividends or distributions received by the holders of the series b preferred stock pursuant to section 4.1 hereof. 9.7.3 issuance of warrants or other rights. if at any time the company shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of stock or any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the consideration received for such warrants or other rights or such convertible securities shall be less than the conversion price or the market price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in section 9.7.2. no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon such conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. 9.7.4 issuance of convertible securities. if at any time the company shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the consideration received for such stock shall be less than the conversion price or the market price in effect immediately prior to the time 8 of such issue or sale, then the conversion price shall be adjusted as provided in section 9.7.2. no adjustment of the conversion price shall be made under this section 9.7.4 upon the issuance of any convertible securities which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights therefor, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights pursuant to section 9.7.3. no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion of such convertible securities and, if any issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any warrant or other right to subscribe for or to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the conversion price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 9, no further adjustments of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 9.7.5 superseding adjustments. if, at any time after any adjustment of the conversion price which the series b preferred stock is convertible shall have been made pursuant to section 9.7.3 or section 9.7.4 as the result of any issuance of warrants, rights or convertible securities, (i) such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange in such other convertible securities, shall expire, and all or a portion of such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange with respect to all or a portion of such other convertible securities, as the case may be, shall not have been exercised, or (ii) the consideration per share for which shares of common stock are issuable pursuant to such warrants or rights, or the terms of such other convertible securities, shall be increased solely by virtue of provisions therein contained for an automatic increase in such consideration per share upon the occurrence of a specified date or event, then such previous adjustment shall be rescinded and annulled and the additional shares of stock which were deemed to have been issued by virtue of the computation made in connection with the adjustment so rescinded and annulled shall no longer be deemed to have been issued by virtue of such computation. thereupon, a recomputation shall be made of the effect of such rights or options or other convertible securities on the basis of (iii) treating the number of additional shares of stock or other property, if any, theretofore actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of any such warrants or rights or any such right of conversion or exchange, as having been issued on the date or dates of any such exercise and for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor, and (iv) treating any such warrants or rights of any such other convertible securities which then remain outstanding as having been granted or issued 9 immediately after the time of such increase of the consideration per share for which shares of common stock or other property are issuable under such warrants or rights or other convertible securities; whereupon a new adjustment of the conversion price at which the series b preferred stock is convertible shall be made, which new adjustment shall supersede the previous adjustment so rescinded and annulled. 9.7.6 antidilution adjustments under other securities. without limiting any other rights available hereunder to the holders of the series b preferred stock, if there is an antidilution adjustment (i) under any convertible securities, whether issued prior to or after the issue date or (ii) under any rights, options or warrants to purchase additional shares of stock, whether issued prior to or after the issue date which, in either case, results in a reduction in the exercise or purchase price with respect to such security or rights or results in an increase in the number of additional shares of stock obtainable under such convertible security, right, option or warrant, then an adjustment shall be made to the conversion price hereunder. any such adjustment pursuant to this section 9.7.6 shall be whichever of the following results in a lower conversion price: (a) a reduction in the conversion price equal to the percentage reduction in such exercise or purchase price with respect to such convertible security, right, option or warrant or (b) a reduction in the conversion price which will result in the same percentage increase in the number of shares of class a common stock available hereunder as the percentage increase in the number of additional shares of stock available under such convertible security, right, option or warrant. any such adjustment under this section 9.7.6 shall only be made if it would result in a lower conversion price than that which would be determined pursuant to any other antidilution adjustment otherwise required hereunder as a result of the event or circumstance which triggered the adjustment to such convertible security, right, option or warrant, and if an adjustment is made pursuant to this section 9.7.6, such other antidilution adjustment otherwise required hereunder shall not be made as a result of such event or circumstance. 9.7.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the shares of class a common stock into which the series b preferred stock is convertible and the conversion price at which the series b preferred stock is convertible provided for in this section 9: a. computation of consideration. to the extent that any additional shares of stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of stock or any convertible securities shall be issued for cash consideration, the consideration received by the corporation therefor shall be the amount of the cash received by the company therefor, or, if such additional shares of stock or convertible securities are offered by the company for subscription, the subscription price, or, if such additional shares of stock or convertible securities are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering, the initial public offering price (in any such case subtracting any amounts paid or receivable for accrued interest or accrued dividends and any 10 compensation, discounts or expenses paid or incurred by the company for and in the underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with, the issuance thereof). to the extent that such issuance shall be for a consideration other than cash, then except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the amount of such consideration shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration at the time of such issuance as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. in case any additional shares of stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such additional shares of stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger in which the company issues any securities, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company, of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving company as such board in good faith shall determine to be attributable to such additional shares of stock, convertible securities, warrants or other rights, as the case may be. the consideration for any additional shares of stock issuable pursuant to any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase the same shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing such warrants or other rights plus the additional consideration payable to the company upon exercise of such warrants or other rights. the consideration for any additional shares of stock issuable pursuant to the terms of any convertible securities shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such convertible securities, plus the consideration paid or payable to the company in respect of the subscription for or purchase of such convertible securities, plus the additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the exercise of the right of conversion or exchange in such convertible securities. in case of the issuance at any time of any additional shares of stock or convertible securities in payment or satisfaction of any dividends upon any class of stock other than common stock, the company shall be deemed to have received for such additional shares of stock or convertible securities a consideration equal to the amount of such dividend so paid or satisfied. b. when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 9 shall be made whenever and as often as any event requiring an adjustment shall occur, except that any adjustment of the conversion price that would otherwise be required may be postponed (except in the case of a subdivision or combination of shares of the common stock, as provided for in section 9.3) up to, but not beyond the date of exercise if such adjustment either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made amount to a change in the conversion price of less than $.05. any adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount (except as aforesaid) which is postponed shall be carried forward and made as soon as such adjustment, together with other adjustments required by this section 9 and not previously made, would result in a minimum adjustment or on the date of conversion. for the purpose of any adjustment, any event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. c. fractional interests. in computing adjustments under this section 9, fractional interests in the common stock shall be taken into account to the nearest 1/10th of a share. 11 d. challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company shall be required to make a determination in good faith of the fair value of any item under this section 9, such determination may be challenged in good faith by a holder of series b preferred stock and any dispute shall be resolved by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the company and acceptable to such holder. the fees of such investment banker shall be borne by such holder if the company's calculation is determined to be correct and otherwise by the company. 9.7.8 exceptions to adjustment of conversion price. anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the company shall not make any adjustment of the conversion price in the case of (i) the issuance of the warrants or the issuance of shares of class a common stock upon exercise of the warrants, (ii) the issuance of shares of class a common stock to holders of the series b preferred stock upon conversion of all or any portion of their shares of series b preferred stock, (iii) the issuance of the bank warrants or the issuance of shares of class a common stock upon exercise of the bank warrants, (iv) the issuance of the series aa preferred stock, (v) the issuance of class a common stock upon conversion of the series aa preferred stock, (vi) the issuance of the option (the "option") to purchase series b preferred stock, contemplated by the transaction agreement dated january 31, 1997, between the company and hfmi acquisition corporation, a delaware corporation (the "transaction agreement"), (vii) the issuance of the series b preferred stock pursuant to the option, (viii) the issuance of the warrants (as such term is defined in the transaction agreement) (the "new warrants"), and (ix) the issuance of class a common stock upon exercise of the new warrants. 9.7.9 chief financial officer's opinion. upon each adjustment of the conversion price, and in the event of any change in the rights of a holder of series b preferred stock by reason of other events herein set forth, then and in each such case, the company will promptly obtain an opinion of the chief financial officer of the company, stating the adjusted conversion price, or specifying the other shares of the common stock, securities or assets and the amount thereof receivable as a result of such change in rights, and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. the company will promptly mail a copy of such opinion to the holders of series b preferred stock. if a holder disagrees with such calculation, the company agrees to obtain within thirty (30) business days an opinion of a firm of independent certified public accountants selected by the company's board of directors and acceptable to such holder to review such calculation and the opinion of such firm of independent certified public accountants shall be final and binding on the parties and shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the computation with respect to any such adjustment of the conversion price. the fees of such accountants shall be borne by such holder if the company's calculation is determined by such accountants to be correct and otherwise by the company. 9.7.10 company to prevent dilution. in case at any time or from time to time conditions arise by reason of action taken by the company, which in the good faith opinion of its board of directors or a majority of the holders of the series b preferred stock are not adequately 12 covered by the provisions of this section 9, and which might materially and adversely affect the exercise rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock, the board of directors of the company shall appoint such firm of independent certified public accountants acceptable to a majority of the holders of the series b preferred stock, which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the standards established in the other provisions of this section 9, necessary with respect to the conversion price, so as to preserve, without dilution (other than as specifically contemplated by the articles of incorporation), the exercise rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock. upon receipt of such opinion, the board of directors of the company shall forthwith make the adjustments described therein. 9.8 no impairment. the company will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of section 9 hereof and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock against impairment. 9.9 no fractional shares adjustments. no fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock. if more than one share of the series b preferred stock is to be converted at one time by the same stockholder, the number of full shares issuable upon such conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate amount of the shares to be converted. instead of any fractional shares of class a common stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of series b preferred stock, the company will pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the same fraction of the market price per share of class a common stock at the close of business on the day of conversion which such fractional share of series b preferred stock would be convertible into on such date. 9.10 shares to be reserved. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the series b preferred stock, such number of shares of class a common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all of the series b preferred stock from time to time outstanding. the company shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of the state of georgia, increase the authorized number of shares of class a common stock if at any time the number of shares of authorized but unissued class a common stock shall be insufficient to permit the conversion in full of the series b preferred stock. 9.11 taxes and charges. the company will pay any and all issue or other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of class a common stock on conversion of the series b preferred stock. the company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of 13 class a common stock in a name other than that of the series b preferred stock, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issuance has paid to the company the amount of such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the company, that such tax has been paid. 9.12 accrued dividends. upon conversion of any shares of series b preferred stock, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of the shares of series b preferred stock so converted to the date of such conversion. 9.13 closing of books. the company will at no time close its transfer books against the transfer of any shares of series b preferred stock or of any shares of class a common stock issued or issuable upon

a stockholder delivered to the company within ten (10) business days after the giving of any such notice by the company (which request shall specify the number of eligible securities intended to be disposed of by the selling stockholder and the intended method of disposition thereof) the company will use all reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the registration of its common stock in such eligible piggyback registration, the registration under the securities act of all eligible securities in which the company has been so requested to register by the selling stockholders, to the extent required to permit the public sale (in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof as aforesaid) of eligible securities so to be registered, provided that: (a) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its intention to register any common stock, the company shall determine for any reason not to register the common stock or to terminate or withdraw such registration, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the selling stockholders and thereupon the company shall be relieved of its obligation to register (or continue the

registration has been requested does not justify the effort and/or expense to the company of effecting such registration. 2.2 reduction of offering. if the offering is an underwritten offering, the right of holders of eligible securities to registration pursuant to this article 2 shall be conditioned on such holders' participation in such underwritten offering and the inclusion of such holders' eligible securities in such underwritten offering to the extent provided below. in the case of any offering made pursuant to an eligible piggyback registration, if the board of directors of the company (if the offering is not underwritten) or the managing underwriter (if the offering is underwritten) determines in good faith that inclusion of all of the eligible securities requested to be registered in such offering would jeopardize the success of such offering, the board of directors or the managing underwriter, as the case may be, may limit the eligible securities to be included in

eligible securities for which the company has received notice of intent to register by selling stockholders pursuant to this article 3, whether in connection with a primary registration of its common stock or otherwise ("resale registration"). the company shall have the right to select the timing of the resale registration within the resale registration period. the resale registration period shall be extended for a period of 12 additional months if the company shall have been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm that, in such firm's opinion, the filing of a registration statement for the resale registration immediately prior to the end of the original resale registration period might materially and adversely affect the company (including the price of the company's common stock). when the company proposes to file a registration statement for the resale registration, it will give written notice to the stockholders of its intention to do so. each stockholder shall have ten (10) business days from the giving of such notice to notify the company in writing of such stockholder's intention to have the company include in the resale registration such stockholder's eligible securities (which notice shall specify the number of eligible securities (including shares of common stock issuable in the future upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of preferred stock, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, the timing of which conversion, exercise or exchange thereof shall be determined in the sole discretion of the stockholder

registration. the company shall not be obligated to effect the resale registration (i) in the event that the aggregate offering value of the eligible securities to be registered in the resale

selling stockholders selling thereon were able to sell at least 80% of the eligible securities they had requested to sell on such eligible piggyback registration. in the event that the company does not effect a resale registration because (x) the value of the eligible securities to be registered in the resale registration does not equal or exceed $3,000,000, the company's obligation to file a registration statement for a resale registration shall be terminated, and (y) the circumstances set forth in subsection (ii) above apply, the company's obligation to effect such resale registration shall continue and the company shall effect such resale registration pursuant to the terms of this article 3 upon the 5 expiration of the three-month period referred to in subsection (ii) hereof, notwithstanding the expiration of the resale registration period. in addition, the company may postpone for up to three months the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a resale registration if the company believes that such resale registration would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any proposal or plan by the company or any of its subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any merger, consolidation, tender offer or similar transaction; provided, however, that immediately following such postponement, the company shall file or request effectiveness of the resale registration notwithstanding the expiration of the resale registration period. 3.3 registration expenses. the company (as between the company and the selling stockholders) shall be responsible for the payment of all registration expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to this article 3. 3.4 holdback

consecutive months following such effective date. this holdback agreement will terminate on the second anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement for the resale registration. 3.5 black-out period. the company may, by notice given to all selling stockholders under the resale registration, require such selling stockholders not to make any sale of eligible securities pursuant to

non-public information ("non-public information") and (y) the disclosure of such non-public information would adversely affect the company or (ii) such sale would occur during the measurement period (a "measurement period") for determining the amount of common stock, or the amount of any other consideration the amount of which will be based on the price of the common stock, in connection with the acquisition of a business or assets by the company. in the event the sales under the resale registration are deferred because of the existence of non-public information, the company will notify the selling stockholders promptly upon such non-public information being included by the company in a filing with the sec, being otherwise disclosed to the public (other than through the actions of a selling stockholder) or ceasing to be material to the company, and upon such notice being given by the company, the selling stockholders shall again be entitled to sell eligible securities pursuant to the resale registration. in the event such sales are deferred because it is proposed to be made during a measurement period, the company shall specify, in notifying the selling stockholders of the deferral of its sale, when the measurement period will end, at which time the selling stockholders shall again be entitled to sell eligible securities pursuant to the resale registration. if the measurement period is thereafter changed, the company will promptly notify the selling stockholders of such change and upon the end of the measurement period as so changed, the 6 selling stockholders will again be entitled to sell eligible securities pursuant to the resale registration. if the acquisition agreement to which such measurement period relates is terminated prior to the end of the measurement period, the deferral period hereunder shall end immediately and the company will notify the selling stockholders of the end of the deferral period. the company may defer proposed sales of

(b) the indemnifying party may elect to undertake the defense of any claim with respect to which indemnification is sought by the indemnified party by representatives chosen by it reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such asserted liability, it shall within 30 days from delivery of the notice pursuant to section 10.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted liability so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so and the indemnified party shall cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against, any such asserted liability. in such case, the indemnified party may participate in such defense at its own expense. if the indemnifying party, within such 30-day period after notice of any such claim, fails to so defend, the indemnified party will have the right to assume the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof. if, in the opinion of counsel to an indemnified party, the interests of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party with respect to any claim are conflicting, the indemnified party shall be entitled to undertake the defense of such claim at the expense of the indemnifying party. 41 (c) the notice referred to in section 10.5(a) hereof shall set forth the details of the claim (including the amount, estimated, if necessary, of the asserted damages) and the specific provisions of this agreement relating thereto. (d) anything in this section 10.5 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect the indemnified party other than solely as a result of money damages or other money payments, the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to defend, compromise or settle such claim, and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim. section 10.6. limitation on indemnification. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, no indemnification payment for any damages shall be made by hfmi or newco, as the case may be, pursuant to section 10.3(a)(ii) or 10.4 hereof, respectively, except to the extent that the amounts which would otherwise be payable pursuant to either such section relating to such damages aggregate at least $50,000 (the "minimum amount"), and such minimum amount shall be deducted from the aggregate amount payable under section 10.3(a)(ii) or 10.4, as the case may be, with respect to damages payable
