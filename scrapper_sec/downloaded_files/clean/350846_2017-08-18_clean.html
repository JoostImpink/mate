(d) neither the reporting persons nor, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, any person identified on schedule a attached hereto during the last five years has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).

(&ldquo; mssf &rdquo;), wells fargo bank, national association (&ldquo; wfb &rdquo;), wells fargo securities, llc (&ldquo; wfs &rdquo;) and wells fargo capital finance, llc (&ldquo; wfcf &rdquo;; and together with mssf, wfb and wfs, the &ldquo; commitment parities &rdquo;) pursuant to a bridge facility commitment letter (the &ldquo; commitment letter &rdquo;) entered into by and between wabash and the commitment parties on august 8, 2017 (the &ldquo; bridge facility &rdquo;) which facility will mature 364 days after the closing of the offer and merger. it is expected that in lieu of borrowing all or a portion of the bridge facility, wabash will issue and sell senior unsecured high yield notes or enter into another similar long-term debt financing prior to consummation of the offer and merger. the commitment letter also provides for the commitment of the commitment parties to provide wabash with (i) a new asset-based revolving credit facility in the event that wabash is unable to amend its existing asset-based credit facility to permit the offer and the merger by the closing of the offer and merger, and (ii) an additional $188.5 million under the bridge facility to pay off wabash&rsquo;s existing term loan facility in the event that it is unable to amend its existing term loan facility to permit the offer and the merger by the closing of the offer and merger. the commitment of the lenders (as defined in the commitment letter) to provide the debt financings under the commitment letter is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of a material adverse effect on supreme (as defined in the commitment letter) having occurred, the execution of satisfactory documentation and other customary closing conditions. the foregoing description of the commitment letter and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the commitment letter, which is filed as exhibit 10.2 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference. the information set forth or incorporated by reference in item 4 is incorporated by reference in this item 3. item 4. purpose of transaction. (a) &ndash; (b) on august 8, 2017, wabash, supreme, and acquisition sub, entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &ldquo; merger agreement &rdquo;), for the acquisition of supreme by wabash. pursuant to the merger agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, acquisition sub will commence a tender offer (the &ldquo; offer &rdquo;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares at a purchase price of $21.00 per share in cash (the &ldquo; offer price &rdquo;), without interest. the offer will initially expire at 12:01 a.m. (new york city time) on the date that is twenty-six business days following the commencement of the offer. under certain circumstances, acquisition sub may be required to extend the offer on one or more occasions in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the sec. acquisition sub will not be required to extend the offer beyond the end date (as defined below), and may not extend the offer beyond the end date without the prior written consent of supreme. the obligation of acquisition sub to purchase shares tendered in the offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including that the number of shares validly tendered in the offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer, together with the number of shares, if any, then owned by wabash, acquisition sub and any subsidiary or affiliate of wabash or acquisition sub, taken as a whole (but excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been &ldquo;received&rdquo; as defined in section 251(h) of the delaware generation corporation law (the &ldquo; dgcl &rdquo;) by the depositary for the offer pursuant to such procedures), constitutes at least one share more than one-half of all shares outstanding as of the consummation of the offer (the &ldquo; minimum tender condition &rdquo;). 4 as soon as practicable following the completion of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement, acquisition sub will merge with and into supreme (the &ldquo; merger &rdquo;), with supreme surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of wabash (the &ldquo; surviving corporation &rdquo;). acquisition sub will effect the merger after consummation of the offer pursuant to section 251(h) of the dgcl. at the effective time of the merger, the shares not purchased pursuant to the offer (other than shares held by wabash, supreme, acquisition sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries or by stockholders of supreme who have perfected their statutory rights of appraisal under delaware law) will each be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the offer price, without interest, subject to any required withholding of taxes. the merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties of supreme, wabash and acquisition sub. additionally, the merger agreement contains customary pre-closing covenants, including covenants requiring supreme to (i) conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve its assets, relationships, and to retain the services of its key officers and employees, and (iii) take no action that would adversely affect or materially delay regulatory approval. the merger agreement provides that each party will use reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the offer and merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. supreme has also agreed, subject to applicable law, not to take certain actions during the period prior to closing without wabash&rsquo;s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, including entry into certain agreements, certain capital expenditures and making of certain payments. in addition the merger agreement requires that supreme covenant to not solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions, waive any standstill agreement or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning or provide non-public information in connection with alternative transactions. however, supreme may seek clarification of any of the terms and conditions of an acquisition proposal it receives and, if the board of directors of supreme (the &ldquo; board &rdquo;) determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) and, after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors&rsquo; fiduciary duties to the stockholders of supreme under applicable law, may provide information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties with respect to such unsolicited acquisition proposal. the merger agreement also provides that the board may not withdraw or change its recommendation of the offer, approve or recommend any alternative acquisition proposal or enter into any agreement with respect to any alternative acquisition proposal unless the board determines in good faith (after consultation with legal and financial advisors) that an alternative acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal, or that certain material events or circumstances relating to the business prospects of supreme have occurred, but only if (a) the board determines in good faith (after consultation with legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders under applicable law, (b) the board provides wabash with at least four business days&rsquo; advance written notice (provided however, that during the five business days prior to the initial expiration date of the offer, the period for notice shall be reduced to two business days), and (c) during such four business day period (or, where applicable, such two business day period) the board negotiates in good faith with wabash on an amendment to the merger agreement so as to enable the board to proceed with its recommendation of the merger agreement. consummation of the offer is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, the minimum tender condition, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the &ldquo; hsr act &rdquo;), the completion of a marketing period for wabash&rsquo;s financing, the absence of a company material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) or governmental order delaying or preventing the acceptance of the shares or otherwise prohibiting the transaction, performance by supreme of its covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards. consummation of the offer and merger are not subject to a financing condition. the merger agreement also provides for certain mutual termination rights of wabash and supreme, including the right of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the offer is not consummated by november 6, 2017 (the &ldquo; end date &rdquo;), subject to extension for thirty days if all conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the expiration of the offer, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied) other than the applicable waiting period under the hsr act having expired or been terminated. either party may also terminate the merger agreement if there shall be any applicable law that makes consummation of the offer or merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or a final non-appealable order of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction restraining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement. 5 in addition, wabash may terminate the merger agreement if the board withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of the offer or merger in a manner adverse to wabash or acquisition sub, or supreme breaches its nonsolicitation obligations in any material respect. if the merger agreement is terminated by wabash under these circumstances, then supreme shall be obligated to pay wabash a fee equal to $12,751,000 (the &ldquo; supreme termination fee &rdquo;). supreme may also terminate the merger agreement prior to consummation of the offer if the board decides to do so in order to enter into an agreement to effect a transaction it deems to be superior proposal, subject to payment of the supreme termination fee. further, if a third party has made certain proposals to acquire supreme and the merger agreement is terminated (i) by wabash or supreme if the merger has not been consummated by the end date or (ii) by wabash due to an incurable material breach by supreme, and within 12 months of such termination, supreme consummates an acquisition proposal, then supreme shall be obligated to pay the supreme termination fee. if supreme terminates the merger agreement due to an incurable material breach by wabash, or if the acquisition sub fails to consummate the offer when all conditions thereto are met, then wabash may be liable to pay supreme a fee of $20,037,000 as liquidated damages (or supreme may seek other damages or specific performance in lieu thereof). the foregoing description of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the merger agreement, which is filed as exhibit 2.1 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference. information with respect to the tender and support agreements is set forth in item 3 above and is incorporated herein by reference. (c) not applicable. (d) subject to applicable law, supreme shall take all requisite action so that the directors and officers of acquisition sub immediately prior to the effective time (as defined in the merger agreement) shall be, from and after the effective time, the directors and officers of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the surviving corporation&rsquo;s charter and bylaws and the dgcl. (e) under the terms of the merger agreement, supreme may not (i) declare, set aside or pay any dividend on, or make any other distribution in respect of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities; (ii) directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or offer to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities, or effect any reorganization or recapitalization or split, combine or reclassify any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities or issue or authorize or propose the issuance of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for, such shares of capital stock or other securities; or (iii) issue, deliver, grant or sell, or authorize or propose the issuance, delivery, grant or sale of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities the effect of which will be to make such terms more favorable to the holders thereof or enter into or announce any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to the sale, voting, registration or repurchase of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities, in each case except under limited circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement. (f) if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, the surviving corporation in the merger will become a wholly owned subsidiary of wabash. (g) the merger agreement contains provisions that limit the ability of supreme and specified representatives of supreme to engage in a transaction that would entail a change of control of supreme (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. (h) pursuant to the merger agreement, supreme will apply for delisting of its shares from the nyse mkt promptly after the consummation of the merger. 6 (i) upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the shares may become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the act. (j) other than as described above, wabash currently has no plan or proposal which relates to, or may result in, any of the matters described in item 4(a) &ndash; (i) of this schedule 13d (although wabash reserves the right to develop such plans). supreme&rsquo;s stockholders are advised to read the schedule to and the schedule 14d-9, as each may be amended or supplemented from time to time, and any other relevant documents filed with the sec when they become available before they make any decision with respect to the offer, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties thereto. item 5. interest in the securities of the issuer.
