their reasonable satisfaction the documents and information listed on schedule 4.2 (the "data room documentation" (copies of which are attached to such schedule except to the extent appearing at other schedules)), and in entering into this agreement, have taken into account their own review and analysis of the data room documentation (it being understood that in relation to any matter covered by a representation -26- or warranty of cgg expressly set forth in this agreement, the purchasers shall be entitled to rely solely upon such representation or warranty). article v covenants of cgg 5.1 geovecteur accounts receivable ------------------------------ cgg shall, and shall procure that its affiliates shall, promptly upon their receipt from third parties of payment of amounts due to them under accounts receivable outstanding on september 30, 2000 and related to the geovecteur business, pay the amount thereof to flagship on account of the corresponding geovecteur account receivable. on december 29, 2000 (or if such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business day), cgg will pay to the companies, without any set-off or reduction, the unpaid balance of the geovecteur accounts receivable (net of reserves for doubtful accounts included in the final closing balance sheet), whereupon the purchasers shall cause the companies to assign all such unpaid geovecteur accounts receivable to cgg. 5.2 cgg flagship accounts receivable -------------------------------- cgg shall, and shall procure that its affiliates shall, promptly upon their receipt from third parties of payment of amounts due to them under accounts receivable outstanding on september 30, 2000 and related to the flagship business, pay the amount thereof to flagship on account of the corresponding cgg flagship account receivable. on march 31, 2001 (or if such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business day), cgg will pay to the companies, without any set-off or reduction, the unpaid balance of the cgg flagship accounts receivable (net of reserves for doubtful accounts included in the final closing balance sheet). 5.3 covenant not to compete ----------------------- except as contemplated by the umbrella services agreement or the support agreement: (i) for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the date hereof, cgg shall not, and shall procure that all of its affiliates which it controls do not, directly or indirectly, engage in the commercial sale (i.e., through the granting of licensee) anywhere in the world of any products the same or similar to those currently included in the flagship business; and (ii) cgg shall not, and shall procure that all of its affiliates which it controls do not, use commercially the names "flagship", "petrosystems", "stratimagic", "seisfacies", "gem", "integral plus", "nexmodel" and "stratqc" or otherwise simulate any of the foregoing names. cgg and the purchasers acknowledge the fact that a part of stratimagic (the "propagator") is included in some of the tools used by cgg or its affiliates centers in the course of their service activity to the clients. should any of the tools making use of the "propagator" be sold to a client (commercial sale through the granting of license) by cgg or any of its affiliates, a -27- royalty of u.s.$ 12,000 shall be paid to the purchasers by cgg. it is specified that the use of the "propagator" by cgg or its affiliates is made on an "as is" basis and that neither cgg nor any of its affiliates will be entitled to claim support or the supply of updates to such products. cgg further undertakes to pay all third party royalties payments if and when due upon written notification by the purchasers or the companies. furthermore, cgg and the purchasers (for themselves and on behalf of the companies) recognize that a "software development toolbox" (i.e., a set of software components; libraries, re-usables and modules which are not applications) related to and derived from gem exists within the cgg or its affiliates software development teams and that this software development toolbox has independently evolved during the past two years and is now significantly different. the parties nevertheless acknowledge that some similarities still exist at the level of the non-geoscience common tools (particularly drag and drop and base map). the parties expressly agree that cgg and its affiliates will retain the entire and non restricted ownership of this software development toolbox and will therefore be entitled to further use, develop and maintain such tool box. cgg agrees not to, and shall procure that its affiliates do not use the name "gem" any longer in any external communication. in consequence therefore, the parties agree that any amount that may be due to the fsh will be shared equally between cgg and flagship sa and therefore cgg will reimburse as promptly as practicable, upon presentation of appropriate documentation, half of any amount paid by flagship s.a. to the fsh with respect to the gem project. 5.4 lock-up ------- during the twelve-month period commencing on the date hereof, cgg and its affiliates shall not sell or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any agreement to sell or dispose of, any of the paradigm shares without the authorization of the paradigm board, except for (i)

----------------------------- in the event that an third party which is not an affiliate of paradigm (a "third party") makes an offer to purchase all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of paradigm (the "third party offer"), which third party offer has been approved and recommended by the board of directors of paradigm (the "paradigm board"), and shareholders holding at least 75% of the outstanding ordinary shares of paradigm have accepted the third party offer, cgg irrevocably agrees, on behalf of itself and all of its affiliates which it controls, to sell their ordinary shares to the third party on the terms of the third party offer, provided that: (i) pursuant to the terms of the third party offer, cgg and its selling affiliates will receive cash or securities traded on a major internationally recognized stock exchange or regulated electronic trading market which are of a number and character such that they may be disposed of by cgg and its selling affiliates on such stock exchange or regulated electronic trading market without any legal or contractual limitations within twelve (12) months of the date of receipt; and -28- (ii) the sale of any such ordinary shares and/or the acceptance or receipt of any such securities would not violate any laws or any material contracts to which cgg or any of its selling affiliates is subject. 5.6 retention of records -------------------- cgg agrees that for a period of not less than four (4) years following the date hereof, it shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the companies existing as of the date hereof except with the prior written consent of purchasers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. cgg agrees that it shall make available to purchasers and their representatives and agents all such books and records, and permit purchasers and their representatives and agents to examine, make extracts from and, at their expense, copy such books and records at any time during normal business hours for any proper business purpose. article vi covenants of paradigm 6.1 guaranteed obligations ---------------------- the purchasers shall cause the companies fully to perform and observe all the obligations required to be performed and observed by the companies under each agreement or other obligation of either of them identified on schedule 6.1 and with respect to which cgg or any of its affiliates is obligated as a guarantor or assignor or identified as a party thereto, and shall promptly reimburse cgg and its affiliates for any payments made or other liabilities incurred by any of them in respect of any such obligations; provided, however, that the purchasers shall use their best efforts to obtain the complete release and discharge of the cgg and such affiliates from such obligations by duly executed instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the cgg within sixty (60) days of the date hereof and, if after using such best efforts, the purchasers are unable to obtain such release and discharge with respect to any of such obligations, the purchasers shall thereafter cause the companies to take all action necessary to terminate such obligation as soon as possible, including but not limited to exercising any option to prepay or purchase contained therein. pending such complete release and discharge or termination, the purchasers shall not permit the companies or any of their successors to default under or amend or modify the terms of any such obligation for which cgg or any of its affiliates could still be liable, directly or indirectly, or exercise any right to, or agree to, extend the terms of such obligation or assign or subcontract any agreement or arrangement containing any such obligation to any party. 6.2 retention of records -------------------- the purchasers agree that for a period of not less than four (4) years following the date hereof, they shall not, and shall not permit any of the companies to, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the companies existing as of the date hereof except with the prior written consent of cgg, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the purchasers agree that they shall, and they shall cause the companies to, make available to cgg and its representatives and agents all such books and records, and permit cgg and its representatives and agents to examine, make extracts from and, at their expense, copy such books and records at any time during normal business hours for any proper business purpose. -29- 6.3 paradigm board representation ----------------------------- 6.3.1 as long as cgg and its affiliates hold in the aggregate more than 5% of the outstanding ordinary shares of paradigm, paradigm will recommend to the shareholders of paradigm prior to any general meeting of shareholders of paradigm, at which directors may be proposed to be elected, to elect a representative of cgg (the "cgg representative") to the board of directors of paradigm (the "paradigm board"), and will take all lawful actions to solicit such election provided that: (i) the cgg representative is not directly involved in any business in competition with any material businesses of paradigm viz.: geoscience software and data processing and interpretation; and (ii) prior to the third anniversary date of this agreement, without the approval of the paradigm board, cgg and its affiliates have not acquired additional ordinary shares causing them to then hold in the aggregate a percentage of the outstanding ordinary shares in excess of the percentage held by cgg immediately after issuance of the paradigm shares. 6.3.2 paradigm will give cgg written notice reasonably in advance of the preparation of proxy materials for each shareholders meeting at which directors are proposed to be elected to permit cgg to designate a cgg representative to be included therein as a nominee for election as a director. 6.3.3 paradigm agrees, both for the benefit of cgg and the benefit of any cgg representative elected to the paradigm board (as an express third party beneficiary of this undertaking): (i) to ensure that any cgg representative elected to the paradigm board is covered by and benefits from directors and officers insurance to the fullest extent then applicable to any other member of the paradigm board; (ii) to use its best efforts to comply with the requirements of the israeli companies law, 1999 with respect to the election of external directors and the appointment of a qualifying audit committee by no later than the shareholders' meeting at which the cgg representative is nominated for election; (iii) to use its best efforts to amend its articles of association by no later than the shareholders' meeting at which the cgg representative is nominated for election, to authorize exculpation, indemnification and insurance of its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the israeli companies law, 1999; and (iv) to in all cases ensure that any cgg representative elected to the paradigm board is indemnified by paradigm for his acts or omissions as a director to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (it being understood that if paradigm enters into any indemnification arrangements with any of its officers or directors, it shall be required to enter into indemnification arrangements with the cgg representative equivalent to the most favorable treatment accorded any of its officers or directors). paradigm shall indemnify each of cgg and any cgg representatives for and against any damages suffered or incurred by -30- cgg and/or the cgg representative as a result of any breach of paradigm's undertakings in this section without reference to any of the limitations set

7.4.2 shall be cgg's exclusive remedy for monetary damages for any such non-fulfillment of a covenant or inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty, and cgg waives any other remedies that it may have (excluding specific performance). 7.5 procedure for indemnification ----------------------------- the party making a claim for indemnification under this article vii shall, for the purposes of this agreement, be referred to as the "indemnified party" and the party or parties against whom such claims are asserted under this article vii shall, for the purposes of this agreement, be referred to as the "indemnifying party". all claims by any indemnified party under this article vii shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 7.5.1 claim notices in the event that (a) any claim, demand or proceeding is asserted or instituted by any person other than the parties hereto and their respective affiliates (a "third party") which, if successful, could give rise to damages for which an indemnifying party would be liable to an indemnified party hereunder (any such claim, demand or proceeding, a "third party claim"), or -32- (b) any indemnified party hereunder shall have a claim to be indemnified by any indemnifying party hereunder which does not involve a third party claim (any such claim, a "direct claim"), the indemnified party shall send to the indemnifying party a written notice (a "claim notice") specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of such claim or demand and the amount or a good faith estimated amount of related damages (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) and such available supporting evidence as may reasonably be required by the indemnifying party to assess the merits of the claim and the computation or estimate of damages. 7.5.2 time for claim notice the indemnified party shall send a claim notice (x) in the case of a third party claim, within thirty (30) days of receipt of actual notice of such third party claim (or such shorter period as may be warranted under the circumstances); and (y) in the case of a direct claim, with reasonable promptness in view of the circumstances (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the indemnified party (including the companies in the case of the purchasers) first becomes aware of the facts upon which the direct claim is based). 7.5.3 direct claims in the event of a direct claim, the indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) days following its receipt of the relevant claim notice (or if the amount of the claim was not determined at the time of the claim notice, the date on which amount of the claim has been notified by the indemnified party) (the "direct claim review period") to make such investigation of the claim as reasonably necessary to determine the validity of the claim. for the purpose of such investigation, the indemnified party shall make available to the indemnifying party the information relied upon by the indemnified party to substantiate the claim. if the indemnified party and the indemnifying party agree at or prior to the expiration of the direct claim review period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of the claim, the indemnifying party shall immediately pay to the indemnified party the full agreed upon amount of the claim, in the event that only part of the amount of the claim is in dispute, the indemnifying party shall immediately pay the full amount which is not in dispute. if the indemnified party and the indemnifying party do not reach agreement on or prior to the date of the expiration of the direct claim review period or if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party during the direct claim review period that it disputes its liability to the indemnified party in respect of the underlying claim, setting forth the reasons for such objection, the indemnified party shall have one hundred eighty (180) days after the first to occur of (x) the expiration of the direct claim review period, and (y) the date it receives any such notification from the indemnifying party, to commence arbitration proceedings against the indemnifying party as provided by section 8.7 of this agreement. if the indemnified party fails for any reason (other than impossibility at law) to so commence arbitration proceedings within such one hundred eighty (180) day period, such direct claim will be barred and the indemnified party shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its rights to pursue any other claim against the indemnifying party based on the same facts, events or circumstances. -33- 7.5.4 third party claims (a) third party claim review period. in the event of a third party claim, the indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) days following its receipt of the relevant claim notice (the "third party claim review period") to make such investigation of the underlying claim as it considers necessary or desirable and to notify the indemnified party whether or not it disputes its liability to the indemnified party in respect of such third party claim. if the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party during the third party claim review period that it disputes its liability to the indemnified party in respect of the relevant third party claim, the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have acknowledged its liability to the indemnified party in respect of such third party claim. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party during the third party claim review period that it disputes its liability to the indemnified party in respect of the relevant third party claim, setting forth the reasons for such objection, the indemnified party shall have one hundred eighty (180) days after the date it receives any such notification from the indemnifying party to commence arbitration proceedings against the indemnifying party as provided by section 8.7 of this agreement. if the indemnified party fails for any reason (other than impossibility at law) to commence arbitration proceedings within such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the indemnified party's claim in respect of such third party claim shall be barred and the indemnified party shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any rights to pursue any other claims against the indemnifying party in respect of such third party claim. (b) defense of third party claim. until such time, if any, as it is determined or agreed that the indemnifying party has no liability to the indemnified party in respect of a particular third party claim, the indemnifying party shall have the right to elect, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party within fifteen (15) business days of receipt by the indemnifying party of the claim notice from the indemnified party in respect of the relevant third party claim, at the sole expense of the indemnifying party, to participate in or assume control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of the third party claim, provided that: (i) such will be done at all times in a diligent and bona fide matter; (ii) the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party (upon any eventual determination of its liability) in accordance with, and subject to, the terms contained in this agreement in respect of that third party claim; and (iii) the indemnifying party shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the indemnified party as a result of such participation or assumption. if the indemnifying party elects to assume such control, the indemnified party shall co-operate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in the defense of such third party claim and shall refrain from taking any actions which might jeopardize or interfere with its defense. the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the negotiation, settlement or defense of any such third party claim at its own expense. if the indemnifying party does not so elect or, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to proceed with the settlement or defense of any such third party claim, the indemnified party shall be entitled to assume such control. in such case, the indemnifying party shall co-operate where necessary with the indemnified party and its counsel in connection with such third party -34- claim and, subject to subsection (d) below, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the results obtained by the indemnified party with respect to such third party claim. (c) counterclaim and cross-claim. if so requested by an indemnifying party and related to the claim in question, the indemnified party shall make (or in the case of the purchasers, shall cause the relevant companies to make) any counterclaim against any person asserting such third party claim or any cross-claim against any other person which may be liable. the indemnifying party shall bear the cost of any such counterclaim or cross-claim, which shall not be settled without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party. (d) settlement of third party claims. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any third party claim which is settled or otherwise compromised or in respect of which any admission of liability is made without its prior written consent. in such connection, if the indemnified party shall receive from a third party or if the indemnified party shall propose to make to a third party an offer of settlement of such third party claim (a "settlement offer"), the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of such settlement offer promptly upon receipt thereof from the third party and reasonably in advance of responding thereto, or reasonably in advance of making such settlement offer, and shall provide with such notice all related supporting documentation reasonably required to enable the indemnifying party to assess the relative merits of the settlement offer. at the reasonable request of either of the parties, the parties will consult in good faith with respect to any such settlement offer. the indemnifying party shall then determine in the exercise of its own reasonable business judgment whether or not to consent to the settlement offer. if a settlement offer is received, which the indemnifying party, but not the indemnified party, is willing to accept, the indemnified party may elect to continue the defense of such claim at its own expense, in which case the liability of the indemnifying party shall be limited to the lesser of: (i) damages calculated as if the third party claim were settled in accordance with the proposed settlement offer, and (ii) the damages actually suffered by the indemnified party taking into account the final determination of the third party claim. the failure by the indemnifying party to respond in writing to a written request for consent to a settlement offer for a period of more than ten (10) business days after receipt of such request by the indemnifying party shall be deemed a consent by the indemnifying party to such request. 7.5.5 cooperation from and after the delivery of a claim notice hereunder, at the reasonable request of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall grant the indemnifying party and its representatives (including professional advisors) reasonable access to the books, records, computerized systems, employees and properties of the indemnified party (or of the companies, if cgg is the indemnifying party) to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which the claim notice relates. 7.5.6 mitigation the indemnified party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (and if the purchasers are the indemnified party, they shall cause the companies to use their commercially reasonable efforts) to mitigate any damages resulting from any matters giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this article vii. -35- 7.5.7 payment no amount shall become due and payable by an indemnifying party to an indemnified party in respect of any third party claim unless and to the extent that the indemnified party is under the obligation to immediately pay the relevant damages to the relevant third party as a result of a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a final non-appealable decision of an arbitral tribunal or a binding settlement or other agreement among the relevant parties. 7.5.8 subrogation no amount shall become due and payable by an indemnifying party to an indemnified party in respect of any claim unless the indemnified party shall have effectively subrogated the indemnifying party in all its (and the companies', if the purchasers are the indemnified party) rights against third parties in respect of such claim. 7.6 calculation of damages ---------------------- 7.6.1 in calculating the amount of any damages claimed by the purchasers under section 7.4.1, there shall be deducted: (i) the amount of any indemnification or other recoveries (including insurance proceeds) payable to the purchasers or any of the companies by any third party with respect to such damages payment of which is not disputed by such third party, (ii) the amount of any reserve or provision included in the final closing balance sheet for damages to which such claim relates, and (iii) the amount of any corresponding tax savings or benefit (including any tax reduction, credit, or loss carry-back or carry-forward) (a "tax benefit") which is or will be available to the purchasers or any of the companies in respect of any taxable period. 7.6.2 for purposes of computing the amount of any damages which an indemnifying party may be required to pay hereunder, only the damages actually sustained by cgg, the purchasers or the relevant company shall be taken into account, to the exclusion of any price/earnings or similar multiplier implicit in the purchase price. 7.6.3 if at the time that a claim is made by a purchaser or a payment is required to be made by cgg in respect of any damages suffered or incurred by the companies, the availability or the amount of any corresponding tax benefit cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, the potential tax benefit shall not then be taken into account in the computation of the amount of damages payable by cgg and any required payment shall not be delayed. thereafter, the purchasers shall cause the companies to notify cgg with reasonable promptness whenever a tax benefit is claimed by or on behalf of the companies (or their tax group) or its availability becomes reasonably certain as a result of the damages suffered or incurred by the companies relating to such claim, which notice shall indicate the amount of such tax benefit. cgg shall also have the right, at any time after a claim is made in respect of which the availability of the tax benefit of the corresponding damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, to require that its auditors be given reasonable access to the relevant accounting and tax records of the companies to determine the availability and amount of any such tax benefit. 7.6.4 in the event that the amount of any deduction referred to in this section 7.6 is determined only after payment by cgg of the amount otherwise required pursuant to this -36- article vii, paradigm shall repay to cgg promptly after such determination any such payments that cgg would not have had to make pursuant to this article vii had such determination been made at or prior to the time of such payment. 7.6.5 in calculating the amount of damages claimed by cgg under section 7.4.2, there shall be deducted therefrom the amount of any tax benefit which is or will be available to cgg in respect of any taxable period (following the same principles and procedures set forth in section 7.6.3 as if cgg were the purchaser and the purchaser were cgg), provided that the payment made in respect of the corresponding claim is not taxable to cgg. 7.7 additional rules and procedures ------------------------------- the obligations of cgg and the purchasers to indemnify each other pursuant to this article vii shall also be subject to the following limitations and exclusions: 7.7.1 an indemnified party shall only be entitled to make a claim pursuant to this article vii in respect of a representation or warranty contained in this agreement if a claim notice is properly given within the time periods provided for in sections 7.1 and 7.2, as the case may be; 7.7.2 no claim may be made by the purchasers or cgg, and no amount shall be due by cgg or the purchasers in respect of any such claim, unless and only to the extent that after application of the provisions of this article vii: (a) the amount of damages in respect of which the relevant party is entitled to be indemnified as a result of any individual claim exceeds $50,000; and (b) the cumulative and aggregate amount of all damages in respect of which the relevant party is obligated to indemnify the other party under the preceding clause (a) exceeds $250,000. notwithstanding the foregoing, as between the parties, the foregoing limitations constitute deductibles and cgg, on the one hand, and the purchasers, on the other hand, shall be liable to indemnify each other only for damages in excess of such amounts. 7.7.3 (a) except for those circumstances where cgg has made any fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation or breach with respect to any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this agreement, and notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of damages for which the purchasers (collectively) may claim hereunder, and for which cgg may be liable, exceed seven million us dollars (us$7,000,000). (b) except for those circumstances where any of the purchasers has made any fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation or breach with respect to any of its respective representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this agreement, and notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of damages for which cgg may claim hereunder, and for which the purchasers (collectively) may be liable, exceed five million us dollars (us$5,000,000). -37- 7.7.4 no claim in respect of taxes shall entitle the purchasers to indemnification if it corresponds to a mere change in the time when a tax should have been paid or if such tax can effectively be deducted or recovered by the relevant company (except that the purchasers shall be entitled to be indemnified in accordance herewith for any resulting interest charges or penalties for late payment). 7.7.5 cgg shall have no liability to the purchasers for damages which arise as a direct result of: (w) any act or omission of the purchasers or the companies having as its purpose the precipitation of a claim for indemnification hereunder, (x) any changes in accounting methods or policies, (y) the granting of any extensions or waivers with respect to any statute of limitations applicable to claims which might be made against the purchasers or the companies, or (z) the passing of, or any change in, after the closing, any law or administrative practice of any governmental authority in any such case not actually in force at the date of this agreement (even if retroactive in effect), including, but not limited, to any increase in the tax rates in effect on the date hereof or imposition of any tax not in effect on the date hereof. 7.7.6 notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, a claim for damages resulting from an inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties of cgg set forth in sections 3.1.14 and 3.1.17 (even if such inaccuracy or breach could also constitute an inaccuracy or breach of any other representations and warranties of cgg set forth in this agreement) shall give rise to an indemnification obligation under this article vii only if it is based on a successful third party claim duly and timely notified to cgg. 7.7.7 neither cgg, on the one hand, nor the purchasers, on the other hand, shall be required to indemnify any other more than once on account of the same facts, matters or circumstances, and neither cgg, on the one hand, nor the purchasers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to make any claim for indemnification in connection with damages arising out of or resulting from facts or circumstances of which it was aware at the time of closing. 7.8 treatment of cgg's indemnification payments. notwithstanding the use of the term "indemnification" herein with respect to cgg's obligations under this article vii, the parties agree that any payments made by cgg or received by the purchasers pursuant to this article vii shall be deemed to constitute a partial repayment and adjustment of the purchase price, and agree to treat (and to cause their affiliates to treat) any such payments as a partial repayment of the purchase price for all tax, accounting and financial reporting purposes. article viii general 8.1 brokers and finders ------------------- 8.1.1 cgg represents and warrants to

(d) contribution. if for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. notwithstanding the foregoing, no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount such holder would have been required to pay to an indemnified party if the indemnity under section 6(b) hereof was available. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11 of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) timing of payments. an indemnifying party shall make payments of all amounts required to be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section 6 to or for the account of the indemnified party from time to time promptly upon receipt of bills or invoices relating thereto or when otherwise due or payable. -9- (f) survival. the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this section 6 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any holder, its officers, directors, partners, attorneys, agents or any person, if any, who controls such holder as aforesaid, and shall survive the transfer of such registrable securities by such holder. 7. preparation;

and (b) the company shall give each holder, its underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and accountants such reasonable access to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the business of the company with its officers and the independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such holder or such underwriters, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of section 11(b)(3) of the securities act. 8. rule 144. at all times during which the company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act, the company covenants that it will file, on a timely basis, the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the sec thereunder, and it will take such further action as any holder may reasonably request (including, without limitation, compliance with the current public information requirements of rule 144(c) and rule 144a under the securities act), all to the extent required from time to time to enable the holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the conditions provided by (a) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, (b) rule 144a under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (c) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the sec. upon the request of any holder, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement verifying that it has complied with such information requirements. 9. assignment of rights. each holder may assign its rights under the agreement to (a) any transferee of the registrable securities, if such transferee has executed this agreement and agreed to be bound by the terms hereof (it being understood, however, that such holder shall retain all of its rights hereunder with respect to all registrable securities not so transferred thereby) or (b) any shareholder, subsidiary, partner, nominee or affiliate of such holder or any such transferee. the transferor shall, within twenty (20) days after such transfer, furnish the -10- company with written notice of the name and address of such transferee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned. 10. specific performance. each holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 11. no senior registration rights. the company will not enter into any agreement providing "senior registration rights" to any person other than "eligible beneficiaries", without at the same time providing the same rights to cgg on a pro rata basis (determined by reference to the number of ordinary shares then held by cgg and such person). for the purposes of this section 11: (x) "senior registration rights" shall mean any registration rights of any kind which are senior in priority to, or in any respect more favorable to the beneficiary than, the registration rights granted to cgg hereunder; and (y) "eligible beneficiaries" shall mean any persons investing cash in the company and who may be granted demand or f-3 registration rights without the consent of the "holders" under the terms of the registration rights agreement, entered into in may 1999, by the company, shamrock holdings inc., eastgate fund l.p. and certain other parties, as such agreement is in effect as of the date hereof. the company shall promptly notify cgg of the granting of any registration rights after the date hereof and provide copies of the relevant documentation. 12. notices. all notices required or permitted under the terms of this agreement shall be delivered in the manner called for in the purchase agreement. 13. successors and assigns. subject to section 9, this agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of each holder, such that the rights under this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon subsequent holders of registrable securities without the need for an express assignment. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the company and any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation of the company with or into such corporation (in which the company is not the surviving corporation) or any corporation whose securities are issued in exchange for ordinary shares. 14. severability. in the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. 15. entire agreement. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede and preempt any prior understandings, agreements or representations, written or oral, by or among the parties hereto. -11- 16. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. 17. amendment. any provision of this agreement may be amended, waived or modified only by a writing signed by the company and holders then holding a majority of the registrable securities. 18. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york (without giving effect to the conflict-of-laws principles thereof). in witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this registration rights agreement as of the day and year first above written. paradigm geophysical ltd. by: /s/ eldad weiss ------------------------------ name: eldad weiss title: chief executive officer compagnie generale de geophysique by: /s/ robert brunck ------------------------------ name: robert brunck title: chief executive officer -12- -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
