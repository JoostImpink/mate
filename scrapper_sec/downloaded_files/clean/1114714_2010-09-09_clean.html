&#160; the foregoing discussion does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of credit agreement, a copy of which is referenced as exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; item 4. purpose of the transaction. &#160; (a)-(b) on august 31, 2010, kenexa, salary.com and merger sub entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which (i) merger sub has commenced a cash tender offer (the &#8220;offer&#8221;) to purchase all of the shares at a price per share equal to $4.07, net to the sellers in cash without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes (the &#8220;offer price&#8221;), and (ii) following consummation of the offer, merger sub will merge with and into salary.com (the &#8220;merger&#8221;), with salary.com as the surviving corporation, pursuant to which each outstanding share will be converted into the right to receive the offer price, except for those shares held by salary.com, kenexa or merger sub, and other than those shares with respect to which statutory rights of appraisal und er section 262 of the delaware general corporation law have been perfected. &#160; in connection with the merger agreement, on august 31, 2010, contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, bryce chicoyne, g. kent plunkett, yong zhang, paul daoust, john gregg, edward mccauley, john sumser, terry temescu, robert trevisani, william martin, teresa shipp, brent kleiman, judy duff and nicholas camelio and certain of their affiliates (together, the &#8220;significant stockholders&#8221;) entered into a tender and support agreement with and in favor of kenexa and merger sub (the &#8220;tender agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things, each significant stockholder has agreed to tender in the offer, and not withdraw, all of the shares beneficially owned by the significant stockholder, as well as any other shares acquired by the significant stockholder after the date of the tender agreement. each s ignificant stockholder is required to tender their shares not later than the tenth business day after commencement of the offer, or with respect to any shares acquired after the date of the tender agreement, prior to the expiration of the offer. &#160; (c) not applicable. &#160; (d) under the merger agreement, after merger sub accepts for payment shares validly tendered in the offer, merger sub is entitled to designate a number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to the board of directors of salary.com and its subsidiaries that is equal to the total number of directors on salary.com&#8217;s board of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the shares beneficially owned by merger sub and its subsidiaries (including shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer) bears to the total number of shares then outstanding; provided that the number of merger sub designees constitute a majority of the salary.com board of directors. &#160; (e) unless kenexa has given its prior written consent, the merger agreement prohibits salary.com from (i) issuing, delivering, selling, pledging, transferring, disposing of or encumbering any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of salary.com or its subsidiaries or any securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise receive any such shares or interests or any stock appreciation rights, &#8220;phantom&#8221; stock rights, performance units, rights to receive shares of capital stock or other rights that are linked to the value of salary.com common stock or the value of salary.com or its subsidiaries or any part thereof; (ii) effecting any stock split, stock combination, stock reclassification, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapital ization or other similar transaction; or (iii) granting, conferring or awarding any option, right, warrant, deferred stock unit, conversion right or other right not existing on the date of the merger agreement to acquire any of its shares of capital stock or shares of deferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, &#8220;phantom&#8221; stock awards or other similar rights that are linked to the value of shares or the value of salary.com or its subsidiaries or any part thereof (whether or not pursuant to existing salary.com stock plans). &#160; (f) upon consummation of the merger, salary.com will become a wholly owned subsidiary of kenexa. &#160; (g) the merger agreement contains provisions that limit the ability of salary.com to engage in a transaction that would involve a change of control of salary.com during the pendency of the merger agreement. following consummation of the offer, merger sub will own no less than a majority of salary.com&#8217;s issued and outstanding capital stock and will therefore be able to block any acquisition of control of salary.com by any other person. &#160; (h) upon consummation of the merger, the shares will cease to be quoted on any quotation system or exchange. &#160; (i) upon consummation of the merger, the shares will become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act. &#160; (j) other than as described above, kenexa currently has no plan or proposal which relates to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a)-(i) of this schedule 13d (although kenexa reserves the right to develop such plans). &#160;

to kenexa&#8217;s and merger sub&#8217;s knowledge, after due inquiry, no shares are beneficially owned by any of the persons named in schedule i to this schedule 13d, except for such beneficial ownership, if any, arising solely from the tender agreement. &#160; neither the filing of this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission by kenexa or merger sub that it is the beneficial owner of any of the shares referred to herein for purposes of the exchange act, or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. &#160; (c) neither kenexa nor merger sub nor, to the knowledge of kenexa and merger sub, after due inquiry, any director or executive officer of kenexa or merger sub named in schedule i to this schedule 13d, has effected any transaction in the shares during the past 60 days, except as disclosed herein. &#160;

(c) &#160; notwithstanding section 7.2(b) , from the date hereof and prior to the acceptance date, if seller or its representatives receive an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal which did not result from a breach of this section 7.2 , and the seller board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that (i) such acquisition proposal constitutes, or is reasonably like ly to lead to, a superior proposal, and (ii) the failure to so respond to such acquisition proposal would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the seller stockholders under applicable law, seller may take the following actions: (a)&#160;furnish information to the third party making such acquisition proposal (a &#8220; qualified bidder &#8221;), provided seller receives from the qualified bidder an executed confidentiality agreement (the terms of which are no less favorable to seller than those contained in the confidentiality agreements); and (b) engage in discussions or negotiations with the qualified bidder and its representatives with respect to the acquisition proposal; provided, that the seller shall concurrently provide or make available to parent any information concerning the seller or its subsidiaries provided to such third party which was n ot previously provided to parent. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this section 7.2(c ) by any representatives of the seller shall be deemed to be a breach by the seller of this section 7.2(c) . &#160;

(e) &#160; notwithstanding section 7.2(d) , at any time prior to the acceptance date, the seller board may in response to a superior proposal that did not result from a breach by seller of this section 7.2 , (i) effect an adverse recommendation change, and/or (ii) enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior proposal (an &#8220; acquisition agreement &#8221;) and simultaneo usly terminate this agreement in accordance with section 9.1(d)(ii) if the seller board determines in good faith, after consultation with seller&#8217;s outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law; provided , however , that such actions may only be taken at a time that is (a) after the third (3rd) business day following parent&#8217;s receipt of written notice from seller that the seller board is prepared to take such action (the &#8220; subsequent determination notice &#8221; and such period, the &#8220; notice period &#8221;), which notice will specify the material terms of the applicable acquis ition proposal and identify the person making such superior proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to such superior proposal, including the financial terms of such superior proposal, shall require the delivery of a new subsequent determination notice and the commencement of a new three (3) business-day period), and (b) at the end of such period, the seller board determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or revisions irrevocably committed to by parent and after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal remains a superior proposal.&#160;&#160;during any such three (3) business-day period, parent shall be entitled to deliver to seller one or more counterproposals to such acquisition proposal, and seller shall give parent the opportunity to meet and negotiate with seller and its representatives.&#160;&#160;if parent has proposed to seller revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this agre ement during the notice period prior to seller effecting an adverse recommendation change or terminating this agreement pursuant to this section 7.2 , seller agrees that seller and its representatives shall, during the notice period and if requested by parent in writing, negotiate in good faith with parent and its representatives (so long as parent and its representatives are negotiating in good faith) regarding any such revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this agreement proposed by parent. &#160; (f) &#160; in addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the acceptance date, the seller board may, in response to an intervening event, effect an adverse recommendation change if, and only if, the seller board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that it is necessary to take such action in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law; provided that, the seller board shall not be entitled to take such action pursuant to this sentence unless seller has (x) provided to parent at least three (3) business days&#8217; prior written notice advising parent that the seller board intends to take such action and describing such intervening event in reasonable detail and (y)&#160;during such three business day period, if requested by parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with parent to amend this agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for taking such action as a result of the intervening event. any adverse recommendation change shall not change the approval of this agreement or any other approval of the seller board, nor shall any adverse recommendation change have the effect of causing any state (including delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the offer and the merger. &#160; (g) &#160; from and after the execution of this agreement, seller shall notify parent promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the receipt of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, proposals or expressions of interest with respect to an acquisition proposal (including a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof).&#160;&#160;the seller shall (i) keep parent reasonably informed of the status (including any material change to the financial terms, conditions, or other material terms) of any such inquiries, discussions, negotiations, proposals or expr essions of interest with respect to an acquisition proposal, on a reasonably current basis (and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material change, development, discussion or negotiations) and (ii) provide to parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any acquisition proposal or, where no such written materials are available, a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof).&#160;&#160;the seller shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this agreement, and neither the seller nor any of its subsidiaries is party to any agreement, in each case that prohibits the seller from providing such information to parent. &#160; (h) &#160; nothing in this section&#160;7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit seller from complying with rule 14e-2 or item 1012(a) of regulation m-a promulgated under the exchange act with regard to an acquisition proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the seller board or a committee of the seller board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law (it being understood that any such compliance with rule 14e-2 or item 101 2(a) may constitute an adverse recommendation change).&#160;&#160;in addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this agreement, a factually accurate public statement by seller that describes seller's receipt of an acquisition proposal and the operation of this agreement with respect thereto, or any &#8220;stop, look and listen&#8221; communication by the seller board pursuant to rule 14d-9(f) of the exchange act or any similar communication to the stockholders of seller, shall not constitute an adverse recommendation change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any acquisition proposal. &#160; (i) &#160; for purposes of this agreement, &#8220; superior proposal &#8221; shall mean any written bona fide acquisition proposal (with all references to 15% in the definition of acquisition proposal being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) made by a third party that the seller board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, (i) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed w ithout unreasonable delay, and (ii) if consummated would provide greater value from a financial point of view to all of the seller stockholders than the consideration payable in the offer and the merger (taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other terms and conditions of such proposal and this agreement (including any changes to the terms of the offer or this agreement proposed by parent in response to such superior proposal or otherwise)). &#160; (j) &#160; for purposes of this agreement, &#8220; acquisition proposal &#8221; means any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer for any transaction or series of related transactions, whether or not in writing, involving (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving seller, (ii) a sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition of assets that constitute at l east 15% of the assets of seller and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) a purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term &#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221; for purposes of this agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in section&#160;13(d) of the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of seller or any of its subsidiaries, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing; provided , however , that the term &#8220; acquisition proposal &#8221; shall not include the offer and the merger or the other transactions contemplated by this agreement. &#160; 29 &#160; 7.3 &#160;

work papers.&#160;&#160;seller also shall provide parent with such access to the appropriate individuals (including management personnel, attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of seller&#8217;s business, properties, prospects and personnel as parent or purchaser may reasonably request.&#160;&#160;neither seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege.&#160;&#160;the parties heret o will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.&#160;&#160;in furtherance of the foregoing, no information identifying individual employees or consultants of seller or any subsidiary of seller or protected personal information regarding such employees or consultants will be disclosed under this agreement (including in the seller disclosure schedule) in respect of employees or consultants that are employed (or were employed and remain domiciled) in any country that has enacted legislation implementing the eu personal data privacy directive or similar legislation, except to the extent permitted by a contractual undertaking entered into by seller and parent regarding maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect compliance with such legislation. &#160; (b) &#160; with respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party or its representatives under this agreement, the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the confidentiality agreements. &#160;

provided, however, that parent shall continue to maintain such employee benefit plans and programs of seller (other than stock based plans) until the seller employees are permitted to participate in the plans and programs of parent or the surviving corporation in accordance with section 7.4(a) . &#160; (c) &#160; except as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement, parent shall, and shall cause the surviving corporation to, continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former employees of seller, or obligations of seller under any severance or change-in-control policy maintained by seller, existing as of the date of this agreement and disclosed in section 7.4 (c) of th e seller disclosure schedule (the &#8220; change-in-control arrangements &#8221;).&#160;&#160;for purposes of the change-in-control arrangements, parent acknowledges that the occurrence of the acceptance date will constitute a &#8220;change-in-control&#8221;
