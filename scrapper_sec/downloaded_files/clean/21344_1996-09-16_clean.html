12 - generally will not survive the closing date, subject to certain limited exceptions. in certain circumstances, indemnification payments owed to ko, interamerican, cc argentina, citicorp or spc under the stock purchase agreements shall be satisfied by the transfer by the majority shareholders to the party to whom indemnification payments are owed of shares of common stock (or, after the reclassification, class a stock and class b stock) equal in value to the amount of any indemnification payment which is owed to such person. pursuant to the terms of the spc purchase agreement, from and after the date of the spc purchase agreement, unless the spc purchase agreement is terminated, andina and atlantico shall be fully responsible for the supervision, management and operation of the businesses of inti and cipet. in addition to any other remedies available to ko, interamerican, or cc argentina under the spc purchase agreement or otherwise, if the spc purchase agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated therein are not consummated, andina and atlantico shall take all actions necessary to effect the orderly return of the supervision, management and operation of the businesses of inti and cipet to interamerican and cc argentina, respectively, so that the businesses of inti and cipet are in all material respects in the same condition as when the supervision, management and operation of such businesses were transferred to andina and atlantico, after taking into account changes reasonably attributable to seasonality and the operation of such business in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practices. in light of the transfer on the signing date to andina and atlantico of the management responsibilities for inti and cipet, the closing conditions under the stock purchase agreements are very limited and include only the receipt of andina shareholder approval, the absence of governmental restraints, the continuing accuracy of certain fundamental representations and warranties and similar matters. subject to the receipt of the approval of the amendments by the shareholders of andina, it is presently anticipated that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreements will occur in december 1996. shareholders' agreement on september 5, 1996, the shareholders' agreement, which will become effective as of the closing date, was signed by ko, interamerican, cc argentina, spc and the majority shareholders (collectively, the "shareholders") and andina. certain of the terms of the shareholders' agreement are described below. board representation. pursuant to the shareholders' agreement, after giving effect to the amendments, the board of directors of andina shall at all times consist of not more than twelve incumbent members and twelve alternate members. the ko shareholders shall be entitled to nominate one incumbent member and one alternate member to the board of directors of andina. at every annual meeting and at any special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors to the board of directors of andina, the ko shareholders have agreed to vote all of their shares in favor of the election of the nominee for director -

("cican") prior to january 1, 1997 which would result in certain bottlers (including andina's bottling subsidiaries) in ko's river plate division participating in the ownership of cican. if a definitive agreement relating to a reorganization of cican involving such - 29 - bottlers is not entered into by january 1, 1997, then subject to the approval of the boards of directors of ko and tccc argentina, tccc argentina will enter into an agreement with andina by means of which (i) tccc argentina will sell to andina's current bottling subsidiaries in the river plate division (the "bottling subsidiaries") at a value equal to cican's net worth, a percentage equity interest in cican which is proportionate to the percentage of the unit can volume of coca-cola products in the river plate division represented by sales of the bottling subsidiaries during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of such agreement (for purposes of reference, the parties acknowledge that, based upon unit can volume in the river plate division during the preceding twelve months, the bottling subsidiaries would purchase approximately 14% of cican); (ii) cican will enter, upon such investment by the bottling subsidiaries, into a supply agreement effective january 1, 1997 pursuant to which it will agree to supply cans to the bottling subsidiaries at cican's cost (plus any excise taxes, value added taxes or other applicable taxes pursuant to argentine tax law). for this purpose, cost is defined as the total cash and non cash expenses incurred by cican in a given month (plus any excise taxes, value added taxes or other applicable taxes pursuant to argentine tax law) plus the interest expenses, if any; and (iii) andina will receive as its sole return for the equity investment referred to in (i) the right to be supplied by cican on the terms and conditions of the supply agreement referred to in (ii) without being entitled to profits, dividends or any other return derived from cican's ongoing operations. if arriving to a structure which accomplishes (i), (ii) and (iii) proves not to be feasible, then the parties will work together towards finding an alternative mechanism which delivers the economic objectives sought by andina, ko and tccc argentina. tccc argentina's undertaking to sell cican cans to the bottling subsidiaries at cost, as described above, is limited to 14% of cican sales (assuming andina acquires 14% of cican's net worth). in the event that the bottling subsidiaries' needs exceed, at a given time, 14% of cican sales (or whatever is the applicable percentage), tccc argentina and andina will agree to adjust to the new business reality through a mechanism with the same economic objectives as the one described above. nothing in this agreement or in any subsequent agreements between ko or tccc argentina and andina affects or will affect the right of tccc argentina to establish the pricing formula of the concentrate and beverage bases for the products packaged by cican in cans. the pricing formulae of the concentrate and beverage bases sold to cican will be the same that tccc argentina currently applies or may apply in the future to the bottling subsidiaries. 6.6 spirit of the transactions. (a) the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the other operative agreements, which will result in an equity investment by ko in andina through tccc argentina and interamerican (after their acquisition of spc), are intended to establish a new and expanded relationship that both ko and andina believe has the potential to enhance the growth and profitability of andina as well as the potential to afford ko and the majority shareholders the opportunity to participate in the future growth in the region through andina. in light of this new and expanded relationship, ko will give full consideration to the possibility of financing future growth through increased equity participation, to the extent that - 30 - reinvestment of andina's profits and prudent incurrence of debt prove insufficient to satisfy the capital expenditure needs of andina, and andina and the majority shareholders will look favorably upon ko's desire to have an investment not significantly in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the equity of andina. (b) ko views the current control of the management of andina by the majority shareholders as an important factor in ko's willingness to enter into the transactions contemplated by this agreement, and the parties understand the importance to ko, the majority shareholders and andina of the control by the majority shareholders of the management of andina. accordingly, to the extent practicable and appropriate at such time and under the circumstances, if ko increases its participation in andina capital stock in the future, the parties intend to structure such increased investment in a manner that maintains the majority shareholders' current ability to elect a majority of the andina board of directors. the parties recognize that the structure of any transaction is necessarily dependent on the facts and circumstances that may exist at such time and that the foregoing sentence is not intended to be a commitment on the part of any party. 6.7 accounting for operating results. from and after august 28, 1996, andina agrees that it will for all purposes record on its financial statements the operating results of inti or cipet. 6.8 spc covenants. citicorp and spc agree that, prior to the closing, except as otherwise specifically contemplated by this agreement, spc will not engage in any activity, conduct any business, enter into any agreement or otherwise incur any liabilities or obligations. 6.9 covenants in andina purchase agreement. the covenants and agreements set forth in article 4 of the andina purchase agreement are incorporated herein by reference with the same effect as if fully set forth herein (and any reference to citicorp or spc in such incorporated covenants and agreements shall also for purposes of this agreement be deemed to be a reference to ko, tccc argentina and interamerican), and ko, interamerican and tccc argentina are entitled to rely on such covenants and agreements as if fully set forth herein. 6.10 rights of citicorp and spc under andina purchase agreement. citicorp and spc agree with ko, interamerican and tccc argentina that citicorp and spc: (a) will not amend, modify or terminate the andina purchase agreement or exercise any right under the andina purchase agreement without the written consent of ko; (b) will follow the instructions of ko with respect to the exercise of any right or waiver of rights or conditions under the andina purchase agreement; and (c) at the closing will assign all of their rights under the andina purchase agreement to ko, interamerican and tccc argentina. - 31 - 6.11 andina board of directors. andina shall take all necessary actions to effect the election to the board of directors at or prior to closing of one incumbent member and one alternate member, each of whom is a nominee of the ko parties. article 7 management of inti and cipet by andina and atlantico 7.1 management authority and responsibility.

(iii) the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of andina; or (iv) the occurrence of any event that enables the coca-cola company to terminate in advance one or more of the bottling agreements of andina (including those in which one or more of its affiliates are parties) that represent at least 30% - 3 - of the total unit case volume of "coca-cola" products of andina (including its affiliates) during the twelve preceding months, because of a breach by andina or its affiliates or a change of control pursuant to the bottling agreements, without regard to whether the coca-cola company decides to exercise its right to terminate one or more of such bottling agreements. once any of the exercise conditions occurs the grantors will send the beneficiaries a written notice and the beneficiaries shall decide if they wish to initiate the "option exercise process" within 180 consecutive days from the date of receipt of the notice given by the grantors. the absence of such notice will not constitute a breach by the grantors, but instead the purpose of such notice is to establish the starting point for such 180 day period. the absence of such notice will not prevent the beneficiaries from initiating the option exercise process if they become aware of an event giving rise to an exercise condition through other means. if one or more exercise conditions occurs on one or more occasions, and the beneficiaries have decided not to exercise the option with respect to such exercise conditions, the failure to so exercise shall not prevent the beneficiaries from initiating the option exercise process with respect to a subsequent exercise condition. for purposes of this agreement, the term "controllers of the grantors" means the persons mentioned in appendix a to this contract, and that as of this date appear as "beneficial owners" in the schedule 13g filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) in accordance with the securities regulations of such country. such appendix is understood to form a part of this contract for all legal purposes. "group of controllers of the grantors" shall mean: (a) any of the controllers of the grantors; (b) any of the spouses of the controllers of the grantors; (c) any of the lineal descendants of any of the controllers of the grantors; (d) any person who, in circumstances where the transferor at the time of his death did not have a spouse or any lineal descendants, receives shares or ownership rights of the grantors, as successors by intestacy of any of the persons referred to in (a) and (c) or a person that previously has received shares of the grantors by intestacy in the manner described in this clause (d); (e) any of the wholly owned subsidiaries of one or more of any of the persons previously indicated, and (f) any trust formed for the benefit of any of the persons indicated in the preceding (a), (b), (c) and (d), if one or more of such persons has total control over the voting rights and investment decisions for the funds of said trust. - 4 - "wholly owned subsidiary" of a person shall mean an entity whose rights, interests and shares or other participation in the capital (with the exception of any minority holding of not more than 1%, should this minority holding be necessary according to the law applicable to the relevant entity) are under the complete ownership, directly or indirectly, of said person. the period to exercise the option provided for in this agreement is considered by the parties to be the best suited in view of the reasons which cause them to undertake this option contract, bearing in mind that it is agreed in accordance with the agreements reached by the parties in the mentioned "shareholders agreement", whose effect is not limited in duration; that andina as a corporation has an unlimited duration; and considering, among other things, that the scheduled duration of the future series a and b shares of andina ends on december 31, 2130. the controllers of the grantors shall include in the by-laws of each of the grantors (that, is, freire and freire dos) a provision regarding the existence of this agreement and the option contained herein. sixth: the exercise price of the option will be determined in accordance with the following procedure ("exercise option procedure"): (a) the price shall be determined by mutual agreement of the parties and in the case of disagreement, the price shall be the valuation price of said shares in accordance with the proceeding referred to under the following paragraph (b). (b) for the purposes of this sixth clause, the "valuation price" of the shares of andina owned by the grantors will be the sum in us dollars that the grantors would receive for the sale of their shares of andina in a transaction under market conditions between a willing seller and a willing buyer, as of the date of the notification of the determination of the valuation price. the valuation price shall first be mutually agreed between the parties, or, if the parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 consecutive days, may be determined by the same parties considering the determinations made by two internationally recognized investment banking firms selected one by each party. each of the parties shall select an internationally recognized investment banking firm with experience in the valuation of soft drinks businesses. each of the investment banking institutions selected in this manner shall prepare an appraisal setting forth their determination of the valuation price. the cost of the investment banking institutions shall be at the expense of the grantors and the beneficiaries in equal parts. the grantors shall cooperate fully both in the selection of an investment banking institution and in the determination of the valuation price. if any of the parties does not - 5 - cooperate in the manner described in this document, after ten consecutive days following the receipt of the notification of lack of cooperation by any party, the diligent party will cooperate in good faith with the investment bank(s) already engaged according to the terms of this provision, or, if a bank that should have been selected by one of the parties has not yet been chosen, the diligent party shall have the right to choose an investment banking firm. the investment banking firms that are finally engaged shall be instructed to deliver to the parties, in writing, their valuations within 60 consecutive days from the date of their engagement. the grantors as majority shareholders of andina, will take all steps necessary to obtain the cooperation of andina with the investment banks, and, in general, with the aforementioned valuation process. if the parties do not agree on price within 10 consecutive days from the expiration of the 60 consecutive day term, the investment banks at the request of any of the parties will designate a third investment bank that has the same requisites of reputation and experience and they will ask on behalf of the parties that within 45 consecutive days it make a determination of the valuation price. the investment bank will deliver to the parties a written report with respect to its determination of the valuation price. the costs and the cooperation required in connection with the analysis of the third investment bank will be governed by the terms already mentioned in this paragraph. in the analysis of the three investment banks, they shall always consider the bottling agreements of andina with the franchises granted in such contracts as in effect (even though one or more of the bottling agreements were terminated in the circumstances mentioned in clause fifth, (iv) of this document). the valuation price mutually agreed by the parties, or established by the written opinion of the third investment bank, is hereinafter referred to as the "valuation opinion". (c) the grantors may, within the first ten days following the notification of the determination of the valuation price by the third investment bank, notify each of the beneficiaries that they have terminated the event giving rise to the exercise condition and that they have reversed all of its effects and consequences, returning all things to the prior state existing before the occurrence provided that this paragraph (c) shall not apply if the exercise condition is an event of clause fifth which results in the termination of the bottling agreements already mentioned in this clause, because the termination of such agreements may not be reversed by the grantors. if such termination and reversal takes place, the beneficiaries will terminate the option exercise process (with all costs of the investment banks to be paid by the grantors). if the grantors cannot comply with the 10 day period mentioned in this paragraph, but intend to terminate and reverse the effects of the event giving rise to the exercise condition, they shall notify the beneficiaries in writing of their decision and, in an extraordinary manner they shall effect the termination (with all the effects already mentioned) within the term that ends upon the last of the following events: (i) 50 consecutive days after the notice of the determination of the valuation price from the third investment bank; or (ii) 10 days after the written notice from the beneficiaries regarding their decision to exercise the option. if the option exercise - 6 - process is not interrupted in such manner within a term of 120 consecutive days from the date of the notice of the determination of the valuation price by the third investment bank, the beneficiaries may exercise the option. if the beneficiaries do not exercise the option within such 120 day term their right to exercise the option in connection with such particular option exercise process will terminate. the formalities for the exercise of the option are set forth in the next clause. seventh: the option shares may be acquired by any of the coca-cola company, coca-cola interamerican corporation or coca-cola de argentina s.a., or by any two or by all of them together, or by any wholly owned subsidiary of any of the beneficiaries (hereinafter "authorized successors") in proportions which any of them may freely indicate. for the purposes of the exercise of the option, any of the beneficiaries or their authorized successors, or any two or all of them together, must send the representative of the grantors a written statement in which they express their decision to exercise the option, by a representative with sufficient powers, to the grantors' domicile indicated in the introductory part of this contract. said statement shall be accompanied by the contract in which the stock sale shall be evidenced, which must be signed by the grantors' respective legal representative and sent within 5 days from the date in which it was received by the respective representative of the grantors to the person representing the beneficiaries or authorized successors who sent such written statement to the grantor. together with the return of the contract evidencing the stock sale, (i) the grantors shall deliver to the respective beneficiaries the documents or contracts required by the beneficiaries' attorney in order to effect the purchase of the option shares, including the share certificates if they are held by them and the certificates of the shares that are in custody shall be delivered to the beneficiaries by the custodian referred to in the eleventh clause of this document and in accordance with the terms stipulated therein, and (ii) the respective beneficiaries shall pay the purchase price in cash. furthermore, the grantors shall deliver to the respective beneficiary or, if applicable, to each of the respective beneficiaries, a written and signed declaration, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the beneficiaries' attorney, which establishes that the grantors are the owners of the option shares and in accordance with the conditions indicated in the tenth clause of this contract, and that the delivery of said option shares shall confer to the beneficiary or respective beneficiaries all the right, title and interest in such andina shares. - 7 - eighth: the option shall terminate without liability on the part of any of the parties if any of the following events occurs: a) if the beneficiaries or their authorized successors sell shares of andina to third parties other than their affiliates and as a direct result of such sale the beneficiaries own less than 23,500,000 ordinary shares before the reclassification or 23,500,000 series a shares (or of shares successor to them or ordinary shares, if the series a shares cease to exist); b) if the beneficiaries as a consequence of increases of capital of andina own less than 4% of the ordinary shares before the reclassification or 23,500,000 series a shares (or of shares successor to them or ordinary shares, if the series a shares cease to exist);

d) if the shareholders' agreement mentioned in clause second of this document does not become effective; or e) if the bottling agreements as described in clause fifth, paragraph (iv) of this agreement are terminated in a definitive manner by the coca-cola company, unless the option exercise process has been initiated within a term of one year from the date of termination of such bottling agreements. in this last event, this agreement will be maintained legally effective and in full force until one or more of the beneficiaries exercise the option and acquire ownership of the shares or the 120 consecutive day term mentioned in clause sixth, paragraph (c) of this document elapses without the beneficiaries' communicating in writing their decision to exercise the option. ninth: freire and freire dos hereby undertake in an irrevocable and unconditional manner, as long as this document is in effect, not to encumber and/or transfer in any manner the shares of embotelladora andina s.a. owned currently or in the future except in the circumstances expressly provided by this agreement. this prohibition is granted in favor of the coca-cola company, coca-cola interamerican corporation and coca-cola de argentina s.a., for whom their representatives already mentioned accept. this prohibition will be annotated in the shareholders registry of andina. andina shall certify this circumstance to the custodian, as well as the eventual total or partial termination of the prohibition. it is expressly recognized that freire and freire dos may transfer shares of andina to their wholly owned subsidiaries (the "permitted transferees"), provided that: (i) all the shares transferred to a permitted transferee will continue to be subject to the provisions of this agreement; and (ii) such permitted transferee agrees in writing to comply with the provisions of this agreement. if a permitted transferee ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the grantors, then such permitted transferee must transfer all the shares it owns at that time to the grantors or to another permitted transferee of the grantors. - 8 - tenth: the shares subject to the option will be sold, assigned and transferred free and clear from any lien, actual rights other than those of ownership, interdiction, attachment, suit, resolutory conditions and shareholders agreements, and shall be fully paid to the issuing company or respective assignees, being the sellers jointly and severally liable for its regularization pursuant to law. all of the above said notwithstanding those liens, interdictions or restrictions authorized by the coca-cola company or placed in favor of the coca-cola company, coca-cola interamerican corporation and/or coca-cola de argentina s.a. or of their parent companies, direct or indirect, or their authorized successors, particularly, notwithstanding the restrictions on the transfer of the shares set forth in the "shareholders agreement." eleventh: likewise, hereby and through this contract, mr. jose said saffie and mr. jose antonio garces silva, representing inversiones freire limitada and inversiones freire dos limitada, also referred to as the owners, and mr. diego peralta valenzuela, representing citibank n.a., also referred to as the custodian, hereby and through this contract enter into a custody contract with respect to the shares which are the subject of the option hereby conferred, and to all those shares comprised by said option as provided in preceding clauses, to be complied with in the republic of chile. for these purposes, the owners by this act deliver in custody the certificates that make up the shares which they own according to the first clause of this agreement, which are received by citibank as a custodian, thus remaining in its keeping. the custodian will not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from circumstances or causes beyond its control, including without limitation, nationalization, expropriation, acts of war, terrorism, insurrection, revolution, civil unrest, public gatherings or strikes by personnel that do not belong to the custodian or force majeure. this custody contract shall be subject to the following terms: (a) in the event of an exchange, change or replacement of all or some of the share certificates received in custody for any reason, the custodian shall be broadly empowered, under irrevocable power, to withdraw, on behalf of the owners, without the previous instructions of one or more of the owners or the beneficiaries shares, the new stock certificates to be issued to that effect, all of which shall become subject to this custody contract. however, once the exchange of andina ordinary shares for series a and b shares is effected, the custodian will immediately exercise on behalf of the owners such exchange and the owners will be authorized to withdraw from the custody the series b share certificates, and the custodian will retain the custody over the rest of the shares of andina of the owners. - 9 - (b) in case of the subscription of new shares of embotelladora andina s.a. by the owners, the custodian shall be broadly empowered, under irrevocable mandate, to withdraw on behalf of the owners, with the previous instruction of one or more of the owners or of the beneficiaries, the certificates of the subscribed shares, all of which shall become subject to this custody contract. in case of embotelladora andina s.a.'s split- up, the custodian is broadly empowered, under irrevocable power, to withdraw on behalf of the owners, with the previous instructions of one or more of the owners or of the beneficiaries, the share certificates of the new company or companies to be organized and which correspond to the shares of andina owned by the owners, all of which shall become subject to this custody contract. likewise, in case of a merger of embotelladora andina s.a., the custodian shall be broadly empowered, under irrevocable mandate, to withdraw on behalf of the owners, without previous instructions of one or more of the owners or of the beneficiaries, the share certificates of the surviving company or of the new company to be organized and which replace shares of embotelladora andina s.a. that corresponded to them, all of which shall become subject to this custody contract.
