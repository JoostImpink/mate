and (ii) the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied, including that the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, has expired. the merger agreement also provides that, after completion of the offer, acquisition sub will be merged with and into bioform, with bioform surviving the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of merz (the &#147;merger&#148;). upon completion of the merger, all remaining outstanding shares of common stock not tendered in the offer (other than shares that are: (i) owned by merz, acquisition sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of merz;

as defined in the merger agreement. by their terms, the support agreements terminate upon the earliest to occur of the effective time of the merger, the termination of the support agreements by merz, the termination of the offer by merz, the date of any material modification, waiver or amendment of the offer or the merger agreement that affects adversely the consideration payable to bioform stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement, the termination of all of the stockholder&#146;s obligations under the support agreements, and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. as of december 31, 2009, the stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 12,358,210 shares of common stock (which number includes 846,364 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options which are exercisable within 60 days after december 31, 2009). the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and the support agreements in this statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements included as exhibits 1 and 2 hereto, which are incorporated by reference in this item 4.
