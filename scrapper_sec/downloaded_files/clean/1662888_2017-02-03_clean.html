registration rights permitting the noteholders to include their common stock in such registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations. as a result, when the issuer proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act, other than for certain excluded registrations, the noteholders are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to certain limitations that a lead underwriter may impose on the number of shares of common stock included in the registration, to include their shares of common stock in the registration. stockholder approval on january 26, 2017, the issuer held a special meeting of its stockholders (the &#147;special meeting&#148;). the issuer&#146;s stockholders approved each of the proposals relating to the transaction detailed in the issuer&#146;s definitive proxy statement on schedule 14a, which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on december 13, 2016, including (i) the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial exchange and the follow-on exchange offer (each as defined below) under nasdaq stock market rules 5635(b) and 5635(d) (the &#147;nasdaq proposal&#148;);
