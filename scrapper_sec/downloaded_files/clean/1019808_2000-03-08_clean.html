of carson at the time of the merger, other than those that properly assert appraisal rights, will receive $5.20 per share in cash for each class a and class c share, without interest. even if crayon

is being made pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of february 25, 2000 (the 'merger agreement'), among parent, purchaser and the company. the merger agreement provides, among other things, for the commencement of the offer by purchaser and further provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, purchaser will be merged with and into the company (the 'merger'), with the surviving corporation becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent (the 'surviving corporation'). in the merger, each outstanding share (other than shares held by the company as treasury stock and shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights under delaware law) will be converted at the effective time of the merger (the 'effective time') into the right to receive the share price, in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the 'merger consideration'). the board of directors of the company (the 'board') unanimously (with three directors abstaining) has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, taken together, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the company's stockholders (the 'stockholders'), has approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, and recommends that the stockholders accept the offer and tender all of their shares pursuant to the offer. painewebber incorporated, the company's financial advisor (the 'painewebber'), has delivered to the company its written opinion, dated february 18, 2000, that as of the date thereof, the cash consideration to be received by the stockholders pursuant to the offer and the merger is fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders. a copy of the opinion of the company financial advisor is contained in the company's solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 (the 'schedule 14d-9') filed with the securities and exchange commission (the 'commission') in connection with the offer, a copy of which is being furnished to stockholders concurrently with this offer to purchase. the offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration date (as defined in section 1 below) that number of shares (the 'minimum number of shares') which would represent at least a majority of the voting power of the company's common stock then issued and outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the 'minimum condition'). the offer is also subject to certain other conditions. see sections 1, 14 and 15. to induce parent and purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, certain stockholders who together own all 5,126,163 shares of the company's class c common stock, par value $.01 per share (the 'class c shares' and, collectively with the shares, the 'company common stock'), and 2,875,973 shares (collectively, the 'majority stockholders'), have entered into a stockholders agreement, dated february 25, 2000, with the company, parent and purchaser (the 'stockholders agreement'). in the stockholders agreement, the majority stockholders agreed to convert all of their class c shares into shares and tender all their shares in the offer, subject to at least an additional 565,857 shares being validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the offer. in the event the majority stockholders are not required to convert their class c shares into shares pursuant to the stockholders agreement, they have agreed to vote all their company common stock in favor of the merger and have delivered proxies to parent in this regard. under the company's restated certificate of incorporation, class c shares are convertible into shares at any time on a one-for-one basis and are automatically converted into shares on a one-for-one basis if transferred to an unaffiliated third party. the shares and class c 1 shares generally vote together as a class, with the shares having one vote per share and the series c shares having ten votes per share. collectively, the majority stockholders own shares of company common stock representing approximately 52.6% of the outstanding company common stock, approximately 48% of the outstanding company common stock on a fully-diluted basis and approximately 88% of the voting power of all outstanding company common stock. the company has represented and warranted to parent and purchaser that, as of february 25, 2000, 10,083,485 shares and 5,126,163 class c shares, respectively, were issued and outstanding, 5,126,163 shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding class c shares and 1,487,025 shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options under the company's 1996 long-term incentive plan and 1996 non-employee directors equity incentive program (collectively, the 'option plans'). based on this information, purchaser believes that the minimum condition will be satisfied if a minimum of 8,348,337 shares are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date. parent and purchaser do not currently own any shares. the schedule 14d-9 indicates that, to the best of the company's knowledge, all of the company's executive officers and directors who own shares and/or class c shares, including those party to the stockholders agreement, presently intend to tender all of their shares (including shares to be issued upon conversion of their class c shares) pursuant to the offer. as indicated above, the obligation of the parties to the stockholders agreement to convert their class c shares and tender their shares pursuant to the offer is subject to at least an additional 565,857 shares being validly tendered (and not withdrawn ) pursuant to the offer. the consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, if required, the approval of the merger by the requisite vote or consent of the holders of shares and class c shares. under the delaware general corporation law (the 'dgcl') and the company's restated certificate of incorporation, the stockholder vote necessary to approve the merger will be the affirmative vote of the holders of shares and series c shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares and series c shares voting together as a single class. as indicated above, the parties to the stockholders agreement have agreed to vote all their shares and series c shares in favor of the merger (if they have not previously been required to convert their series c shares and tender their shares pursuant to the offer) and have delivered proxies in this regard to parent. if purchaser acquires at least 90% of the outstanding shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise and all series c shares have been converted into shares, purchaser would be able to effect the merger pursuant to the 'short-form' merger provisions of section 253 of the dgcl, without prior notice to, or any action by, any other stockholder. in such event, purchaser intends to effect the merger as promptly as practicable following the purchase of shares in the offer. see section 11. the company has represented in the merger agreement that it does not have any stockholder rights plan or 'poison pill.' the company also has represented in the merger agreement that the approval by the company's board of the merger and the merger agreement is sufficient to render the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl inapplicable to the merger agreement, the offer, the stockholders agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby. see section 15. the merger agreement is more fully described in section 11. certain federal income tax consequences of the sale of shares pursuant to the offer and the exchange of shares for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger are described in section 5. tendering stockholders will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as set forth in instruction 6 of the letter of transmittal, stock transfer taxes on the purchase of shares by purchaser pursuant to the offer. purchaser will pay all charges and expenses of lazard freres & co. llc ('lazard freres'), as dealer manager (in such capacity, the 'dealer manager'), chase mellon shareholder services, l.l.c., as depositary (the 'depositary'), and innisfree m&a incorporated, as information agent (the 'information agent'), incurred in connection with the offer. see section 16. the tender offer 1. terms of the offer; expiration date. upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the offer prior to the expiration date (including, if the offer is extended or amended 2 as required or permitted by the merger agreement, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), the purchaser will accept for payment and thereby purchase all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures described in section 4 on or prior to the expiration date (as hereinafter defined). the term 'expiration date' means 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on tuesday, april 4, 2000, unless and until the purchaser, in accordance with the merger agreement, shall have extended the period of time for which the offer is open, in which event the term 'expiration date' shall mean the time and date at which the offer, as so extended by the purchaser, shall expire. in the merger agreement, parent and purchaser have agreed that if any of the conditions to the offer are not satisfied, subject to the right of the parties to terminate the merger agreement and to parent's right to cause the company to proceed with the merger (the exercise of such right by parent referred to as the 'merger trigger'), purchaser shall extend the offer for additional periods of not more than ten business days each until the earlier of july 31, 2000, or such time as each such condition has been satisfied or waived. in addition, purchaser may extend the offer (i) on one or more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than ten business days if any conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived, or if the minimum condition has been satisfied but less than 90% of the then outstanding shares have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn or (ii) for such period as may be required by the commission or applicable law. any such extension will be followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement thereof, to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. without limiting the manner in which purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, subject to applicable law (including rules 14d-4(c) and 14d-6(d) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the 'exchange act'), which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to holders of shares), purchaser shall have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a press release to the dow jones news service. if, in accordance with the merger agreement, purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the offer or waives a material condition to the offer, purchaser will extend the offer and disseminate additional tender offer materials to the extent required by rules 14d-4(c) and 14d-6(d) under the exchange act. the minimum period during which an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of the offer, other than a change in price or a change in percentage of securities sought or a change in any dealer's soliciting fee, will depend upon the facts and circumstances, including the materiality, of the changes. with respect to a change in price or, subject to certain limitations, a change in the percentage of securities sought or a change in any dealer's soliciting fee, a minimum ten business day period from the date of such change is generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders. accordingly, if prior to the expiration date, purchaser (with the approval of the company as required by the merger agreement) decreases the number of shares being sought, or increases or decreases the consideration offered pursuant to the offer, and if the offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the period ending on the tenth business day from the date that notice of such increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to holders of shares, the offer will be extended at least until the expiration of such ten business day period. for purposes of the offer, a 'business day' means any day other than a saturday, sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, new york city time. in the merger agreement, the company has agreed to furnish purchaser with the company's stockholder list and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the offer to holders of shares. this offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal and, if required, other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of shares and will be furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares. 2. acceptance for payment and payment. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (including, if the offer is extended or amended in accordance with the merger agreement, the terms and conditions of the offer as so extended or amended), purchaser will purchase, by accepting for payment, and will pay for, all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn (as permitted by section 4) 3 prior to the expiration date, promptly after the expiration date, if the conditions to the offer described in section 14 have each been satisfied or waived, including without limitation the expiration or termination of the waiting periods applicable to the acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the 'hsr act'), and the south african competition act (as defined in section 15). in addition, subject to applicable rules of the commission, purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares pending receipt of any regulatory or governmental approvals specified in section 15. in all cases, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (i) share certificates for such shares ('share certificates') or confirmation (a 'book-entry confirmation') of the book-entry transfer of such shares into the depositary's account at the depository trust company (the 'book-entry transfer facility'), pursuant to the procedures described in section 3, (ii) the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message (as defined below) in connection with a book-entry transfer, and (iii) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. the term 'agent's message' means a message, transmitted by the book-entry transfer facility to, and received by, the depositary and forming a part of the book-entry confirmation, which states that the book-entry transfer facility has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in such book-entry transfer facility tendering the shares which are the subject of the book-entry confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that purchaser may enforce such agreement against such participant. for purposes of the offer, purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as, if and when purchaser gives oral or written notice to the depositary of purchaser's acceptance of such shares for payment pursuant to the offer. in all cases, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, payment for shares purchased pursuant to the offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the depositary, which will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of receiving payment from purchaser and transmitting payment to validly tendering stockholders. under no circumstances will interest on the purchase price for shares be paid by purchaser by reason of any delay in making such payment. if any tendered shares are not purchased pursuant to the offer for any reason, or if share certificates are submitted representing more shares than are tendered, share certificates representing unpurchased or untendered shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder (or, in the case of shares delivered by book-entry transfer into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility pursuant to the procedures described in section 3, such shares will be credited to an account maintained within the book-entry transfer facility), as promptly as practicable following the expiration, termination or withdrawal of the offer. if, prior to the expiration date, purchaser increases the consideration offered to holders of shares pursuant to the offer, such increased consideration will be paid to all holders of shares that are purchased pursuant to the offer, whether or not such shares were tendered prior to such increase in consideration. purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of purchaser's subsidiaries or affiliates the right to purchase all or any portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve purchaser of its obligations under the offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer. 3. procedures for accepting the offer and tendering shares. valid tender of shares. except as set forth below, in order for shares to be validly tendered pursuant to the offer, (i) the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry delivery of shares, and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal must be received by the depositary at one of its addresses specified on the back cover of this offer to purchase 4 on or prior to the expiration date and either share certificates representing tendered shares must be received by the depositary, or such shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer described below and a book-entry confirmation must be received by the depositary, in each case on or prior to the expiration date, or (ii) the guaranteed delivery procedures described below must be complied with. the method of delivery of share certificates and the letter of transmittal and all other required documents, including delivery through the book-entry transfer facility, is at the election and sole risk of the tendering stockholder. the shares will be deemed delivered only when actually received by the depositary (including, in the case of a book-entry transfer, by book-entry confirmation). if delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. in all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. book-entry transfer. the depositary will make a request to establish accounts with respect to the shares at the book-entry transfer facility for purposes of the offer within two business days after the date of this offer to purchase. any financial institution that is a participant in the system of the book-entry transfer facility may make book-entry delivery of shares by causing the book-entry transfer facility to transfer such shares into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility in accordance with the book-entry transfer facility's procedures for such transfer. however, although delivery of shares may be effected through book-entry transfer into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility, the letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer, and any other required documents must, in any case, be transmitted to and received by the depositary at one of its addresses specified on the back cover of this offer to purchase on or prior to the expiration date, or the guaranteed delivery procedure described below must be complied with. delivery of documents to the book-entry transfer facility in accordance with the book-entry transfer facility's procedures does not constitute delivery to the depositary. signature guarantees. signatures on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is a member in good standing of the securities transfer agents medallion program, the new york stock exchange ('nyse') medallion signature guarantee program or the stock exchange medallion program (each, an 'eligible institution'), unless the shares tendered thereby are tendered (i) by a registered holder of shares who has not completed either the box labeled 'special payment instructions' or the box labeled 'special delivery instructions' on the letter of transmittal or (ii) for the account of an eligible institution. see instruction 1 of the letter of transmittal. if the share certificates are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the letter of transmittal, or if payment is to be made to, or share certificates for unpurchased shares are to be issued or returned to, a person other than the registered holder, then the tendered certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, signed exactly as the name or names of the registered holder or holders appear on the share certificates, with the signatures on the share certificates or stock powers guaranteed by an eligible institution as provided in the letter of transmittal. see instructions 1 and 5 of the letter of transmittal. if the share certificates are forwarded separately to the depositary, a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof) must accompany each such delivery. guaranteed delivery. if a stockholder desires to tender shares pursuant to the offer and such stockholder's share certificates are not immediately available or time will not permit all required documents to reach the depositary on or prior to the expiration date, or the procedures for book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a timely basis, such shares may nevertheless be tendered if all of the following guaranteed delivery procedures are duly complied with: (i) such tender is made by or through an eligible institution; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery, substantially in the form made available by the purchaser, is received by the depositary, as provided below, on or prior to the expiration date; and 5 (iii) the share certificates (or a book-entry confirmation) representing all tendered shares, in proper form for transfer together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal are received by the depositary, within three nyse trading days after the date of execution of such notice of guaranteed delivery. the notice of guaranteed delivery may be delivered by hand or transmitted by facsimile transmission or mail to the depositary and must include a guarantee by an eligible institution in the form contained in such notice of guaranteed delivery. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, payment for shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer will in all cases be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of share certificates for, or of book-entry confirmation with respect to, such shares, a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), together with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message), and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. accordingly, payment might not be made to all tendering stockholders at the same time, and will depend upon when share certificates or book-entry confirmations of such shares are received into the depositary's account at the book-entry transfer facility. backup federal tax withholding. under the federal income tax laws, the depositary will be required to withhold 31% of the amount of any payments made to certain stockholders pursuant to the offer. to prevent backup federal income tax withholding on payments made to certain stockholders with respect to the purchase price of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, each such stockholder must provide the depositary with his correct taxpayer identification number and certify, under penalty of perjury, that he is not subject to backup federal income tax withholding by completing the substitute form w-9 included in the letter of transmittal. see instruction 10 of the letter of transmittal. appointment as proxy. by executing the letter of transmittal, a tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints purchaser and any purchaser designee, and each of them, as such stockholder's attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of substitution, in the manner set forth in the letter of transmittal, to the full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the shares tendered by such stockholder and accepted for payment by purchaser and with respect to any and all other shares and other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such shares on or after the date of this offer to purchase. all such powers of attorney and proxies shall be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered shares. such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, purchaser accepts such shares for payment. upon payment by purchaser for the shares, all powers of attorney and proxies given by such stockholder with respect to such shares and such other securities or rights prior to such payment will be revoked, without further action, and no subsequent powers of attorney and proxies may be given by such stockholder (and, if given, will not be deemed effective). the designees of purchaser will, with respect to the shares for which such appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights of such stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or any adjournment or postponement of such meeting. purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the payment for such shares, purchaser or its designee must be able to exercise full voting, consent and other rights with respect to such shares and other securities, including voting at any meeting of the stockholders. determination of validity. all questions as to the form of documents and validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of shares will be determined by purchaser, in its discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding on all parties. purchaser reserves the right to reject any or all tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance of or payment for which may, in the opinion of purchaser's counsel, be unlawful. purchaser also reserves the right (subject to the provisions of the merger agreement) to waive any of the conditions of the offer or any defect or irregularity in any tender of shares of any particular stockholder whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders. purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the offer (including the letter of transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be final and binding. no tender of shares will be deemed 6 to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities with respect to such tender have been cured or waived. none of purchaser, parent or any of their affiliates or assigns, if any, the dealer manager, the depositary, the information agent or any other person will be under any duty to give any notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. purchaser's acceptance for payment of shares tendered pursuant to any of the procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering stockholder and purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer. 4. withdrawal rights. except as otherwise provided in this section 4, tenders of shares made pursuant to the offer are irrevocable. shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to the expiration date and, unless theretofore accepted for payment as provided herein, may also be withdrawn at any time after may 6, 2000. if, for any reason whatsoever, acceptance for payment of any shares tendered pursuant to the offer is delayed, or purchaser is unable to accept for payment or pay for shares tendered pursuant to the offer, then, without prejudice to purchaser's rights set forth herein, the depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of purchaser, retain tendered shares and such shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that the tendering stockholder is entitled to and duly exercises withdrawal rights as described in this section 4. any such delay will be by an extension of the offer to the extent required by law. for a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the depositary at one of its addresses specified on the back cover of this offer to purchase. any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be withdrawn, and (if share certificates have been tendered) the name of the registered holder of the shares as set forth in the share certificate, if different from that of the person who tendered such shares. if share certificates have been delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, then prior to the physical release of such certificates, the tendering stockholder must also submit the serial numbers shown on the particular certificates evidencing the shares to be withdrawn and the signature on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution, except in the case of shares tendered for the account of the eligible institution. if shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer described in section 3, the notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the book-entry transfer facility to be credited with the withdrawn shares, in which case a notice of withdrawal will be effective if delivered to the depositary by any method of delivery described in the first sentence of this paragraph. withdrawals of shares may not be rescinded. any shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the offer, but may be retendered at any subsequent time prior to the expiration date by following any of the procedures described in section 3. all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding. none of purchaser, parent or any of their affiliates or assigns, if any, the dealer manager, the depositary, the information agent or any other person will be under any duty to give any notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. 5. certain u.s. federal income tax consequences. the following is a general summary of certain u.s. federal income tax consequences of the offer and the merger relevant to a beneficial holder of shares whose shares are tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer or whose shares are converted to cash in the merger (a 'holder'). the discussion is based on the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the 'code'), regulations issued thereunder, judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. the following does not address the u.s. federal income tax consequences to all categories of holders that may be subject to special rules (e.g., holders who acquired their shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements with the company, foreign holders, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities and persons who have acquired the shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment), nor does it address the federal income tax consequences to persons who do not hold the shares as 'capital assets' within the meaning of section 1221 of the code (generally, property held for investment). holders should consult their own 7 tax advisors regarding the u.s. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of the offer and the merger. the receipt of cash for shares pursuant to the offer or the merger will be a taxable transaction for u.s. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income and other tax laws. in general, a holder who sells shares pursuant to the offer or has shares converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares sold pursuant to the offer or converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) tendered pursuant to the offer or converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held the shares for more than one (1) year at the time of the consummation of the offer or the merger. capital gains recognized by an individual investor (or an estate or certain trusts) upon a disposition of a share that has been held for more than one year generally will be subject to a maximum tax rate of 20% or, in the case of a share that has been held for one year or less, will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates. certain limitations apply to the use of capital losses. holders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to their shares generally will be subject to the same treatment as that described above for holders who receive cash for shares pursuant to the offer and merger. 6. price range of the shares; dividends. according to the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 1998 (the 'company's 1998 annual report'), the shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol 'cic.' the following table presents, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices for the shares as reported by bloomberg l.p.: shares ------------------ high low ---- --- 1998 first quarter.............................................. $10.1250 $5.8750 second quarter............................................. 10.7500 5.7500 third quarter.............................................. 7.8125 1.5000 fourth quarter............................................. 5.0000 1.8750 1999 first quarter.............................................. 5.1250 2.7500 second quarter............................................. 4.3750 2.5000 third quarter.............................................. 3.5000 2.5000 fourth quarter............................................. 4.3750 2.6250 2000 first quarter (through march 7, 2000)...................... 5.0000 2.8750 on february 25, 2000, the last full day of trading prior to the announcement of the merger, the last sales price for the shares as reported by bloomberg l.p. was $3.75 per share. on march 7, 2000, the last full day of trading prior to the commencement of the offer, the last reported sales price for the shares as reported by bloomberg l.p. was $5.00 per share. stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for the shares. according to the company's 1998 annual report and subsequent reports filed with the commission pursuant to the exchange act, the company did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to the shares during any of the periods indicated in the table. in the company's 1998 annual report, the company stated its expectation that earnings would be retained in the future and that no cash dividends would be paid to its stockholders for the foreseeable future. under the terms of the merger agreement, the company is not permitted to declare or pay dividends with respect to the shares without the prior written consent of parent, and parent does not intend to consent to any such declaration or payment. 8 7. effect of the offer on the market for the shares; stock exchange listings; exchange act registration; margin regulations. effect of the offer on the market for the shares. the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares held by the public. the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer can also be expected to reduce the number of holders of shares. nyse quotation. the shares are traded through the nyse. depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares may no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and may, therefore, be delisted from the exchange. according to the nyse's published guidelines, the nyse would consider delisting the shares if, among other things, the number of publicly-held shares (excluding shares held by officers, directors, their immediate families and other concentrated holdings of 10% or more) were less than 600,000, there were less than 1,200 holders of at least 100 shares or the aggregate market value of the publicly-held shares were less than $5 million. the company has advised that, as of february 25, 2000, there were 10,083,485 shares outstanding, 13,245 shares held in the company's treasury, and approximately 123 holders of record of such shares. if, as a result of the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the shares no longer meet the requirements of the nyse for continued listing and the listing of shares is discontinued, the market for the shares could be adversely affected. if the nyse were to delist the shares (which purchaser intends to cause the company to seek if it acquires control of the company and the shares no longer meet the nyse listing requirements), it is possible that the shares would trade on another securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations for the shares would be reported by such exchange or through the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system or other sources. the extent of the public market for the shares and availability of such quotations would, however, depend upon such factors as the number of holders and/or the aggregate market value of the publicly-held shares at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act and other factors. exchange act registration. the shares are currently registered under the exchange act. the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer may result in the shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the exchange act. registration of the shares may be terminated upon application by the company to the commission if the shares are not listed on a 'national securities exchange' and there are fewer than 300 record holders of shares. termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the company to its stockholders and the commission and would make certain provisions of the exchange act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of section 16(b) and the requirements of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders' meetings pursuant to section 14(a), no longer applicable to the company. if the shares are no longer registered under the exchange act, the requirements of rule 13e-3 under the exchange act with respect to 'going private' transactions would no longer be applicable to the company. furthermore, the ability of 'affiliates' of the company and persons holding 'restricted securities' of the company to dispose of such securities pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act of 1933, as amended, may be impaired or eliminated. if, as a result of the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the merger, the company is no longer required to maintain registration of the shares under the exchange act, the purchaser intends to cause the company to apply for termination of such registration. see section 11. margin regulations. the shares are currently 'margin securities' under the regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the 'federal reserve board'), which have the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such shares for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading in securities ('purpose loans'). depending upon factors such as the number of record holders of the shares and the number and market value of publicly held shares, following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer, the shares might no longer constitute 'margin securities' for purposes of the federal reserve board's margin regulations and, therefore, could no longer be used as collateral for purpose loans made by brokers. in addition, if registration of the shares under the exchange act is terminated, the shares will no longer constitute 'margin securities.' 9 8. certain information

the offer; contacts with the company. in late july 1997, at the initiation of parent, representatives of parent and parent's financial advisor, lazard freres, met with two members of the executive committee of the company's board of directors and a former financial advisor to the company to explore an acquisition of the company. on july 24, 1997, in preparation for this meeting, parent entered into a confidentiality agreement for the purpose of receiving non-public information with respect to the company; the agreement also contained two-year standstill provisions. in autumn 1997, parent, through lazard freres, conveyed to the company's former financial advisor that parent was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of the company. in february 1999, a representative of painewebber contacted a representative of parent to suggest that parent reconsider acquiring the company. on march 10, 1999, parent entered into an agreement with the company in which parent reaffirmed its confidentiality and standstill obligations (collectively with the july 24, 1997 agreement, the 'confidentiality agreement'). representatives of the company and painewebber made a management presentation to representatives of parent and lazard freres, who then conducted certain follow-up due diligence. shortly after the meeting, lazard freres conveyed to painewebber that parent was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of the company. 14 in late summer 1999, a representative of painewebber contacted a representative of parent to suggest that parent again consider acquiring the company. in september and early october 1999, representatives of parent and lazard freres had several meetings and discussions with representatives of the company and painewebber, respectively. during one of these meetings, the company made an updated management presentation to parent. from late october through early december, representatives of parent and lazard freres conducted due diligence regarding the company, including discussions with the company's senior management and, in the case of parent, plant visits. on january 4, 2000, painewebber sent a letter to parent requesting a non-binding indication of interest for the acquisition of the company. the company's legal counsel, milbank, tweed, hadley & mccloy llp, provided parent with a proposed form of merger agreement and a proposed form of stockholders agreement indicating that holders of a portion of the series c shares representing a majority of the voting power of all company common stock would agree to support the transaction. on january 7, 2000, parent, through lazard freres, advised representatives of painewebber that parent was chiefly interested in acquiring the company's international operations. painewebber responded that the company's strong preference was to seek to sell the entire company. on january 14, 2000, parent, through lazard freres, submitted a written non-binding indication of interest in acquiring the entire company at a price of $5.00 per share. parent indicated that its proposal was subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence. parent also indicated that it expected the company and its affiliates would negotiate exclusively with parent and cease soliciting other bids until march 15, 2000 and, that during this period, parent expected to complete due diligence, negotiate a definitive merger agreement and stockholders agreement and secure an acceptable arrangement for the continuation of the company's top management. lazard freres subsequently confirmed to painewebber that parent's bid was subject to reduction to reflect the estimated cost, above 101% of principal amount, of retiring the company's senior subordinated bonds. on january 21, 2000, painewebber sent a letter to parent requesting that parent submit a firm and final offer to acquire the company by january 27, 2000. in response, parent, through lazard freres, orally reaffirmed its $5.00 per share bid and indicated the bid would not be subject to reduction to reflect the estimated bond retirement cost. on or about january 31, 2000, parent, through its legal counsel, weil, gotshal & manges llp, furnished to the company a mark-up of the company's proposed forms of merger agreement and stockholders agreement. among the changes requested by parent were (i) adding the minimum condition to the offer, (ii) requiring that all holders of series c shares enter into the stockholders agreement, (iii) providing parent with the merger trigger in the event the minimum condition was not met and (iv) expanding the definition of 'material adverse change'. on february 1, 2000, painewebber indicated to parent, through lazard freres, that the company would be willing to enter into a one-week exclusivity agreement if parent increased its bid to $5.25 per share and withdrew its request to expand the definition of 'material adverse change'. also on february 1, 2000, parent and its legal counsel began a series of discussions with the company and its legal counsel to negotiate the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement, other than price. on february 2, 2000, parent agreed to increase its bid to $5.25 per share, subject to confirmatory due diligence, as long as the company agreed to expand the 'material adverse change' definition and the company entered into an exclusivity agreement through february 16, 2000. on february 3, 2000, parent, the company and dnl partners limited partnership ('dnl'), the company's largest stockholder, entered into an exclusivity agreement (the 'exclusivity agreement'), which provided that, through midnight on february 14, 2000, the company would afford parent and its affiliates reasonable access to complete their due diligence review of the company and the company would negotiate exclusively with parent and not solicit other bids. during this period, representatives of parent and its affiliates conducted additional due diligence regarding the company. in addition, parent and malcolm yesner, the company's chief executive officer, 15 reached agreement on the terms of an employment agreement with parent (the 'yesner employment agreement'), to be effective upon consummation of the offer, under which mr. yesner would serve as president of the company's u.s. operating subsidiary, carson products, for an initial term of two years, subject to renewal. (under his existing employment agreement with the company, mr. yesner would be entitled to terminate his employment agreement immediately upon the change of control and receive severance pay and non-competition payments.) l'oreal also reached agreements to ensure continuity of management at carson south africa. as a result of its continuing due diligence, parent, through its legal counsel, conveyed to the company that it would be a condition to parent entering into the merger agreement that the company settle all disputes with a former affiliate, am cosmetics corp. ('am'), including pending litigation and arbitration proceedings, on terms satisfactory to parent, and that certain directors and/or officers of the company who had previously been directors and/or officers of am release the company from potential indemnification obligations related to their roles with am (the 'indemnity releases'). parent indicated to the company that the financial terms of a draft settlement agreement between the company and am would be acceptable to it. under this draft, the company would have paid am $650,000 and surrendered shares of am preferred stock held by the company. on february 18, 2000, the company, through its legal counsel, advised parent that am had indicated it was unwilling to grant releases in form and scope acceptable to the company and parent unless the cash settlement payment was increased to $2,000,000. the company acknowledged to parent that, to the extent the company bore the proposed $1,350,000 increase in the cash settlement payment, parent's acquisition cost would be effectively increased. the company also acknowledged to parent that, based on its prior negotiations with parent, it was aware that parent would be unwilling to bear any of such increase. finally, the company advised parent that, to induce parent to proceed with the transaction, dnl was willing to bear a portion of the increase. after discussion among their financial advisors, the company, parent and dnl agreed that dnl would directly contribute $531,492 of the increased settlement payment out of the proceeds it would receive pursuant to the first to occur of the offer or the merger and the offer price would be reduced by $0.05 per share, an amount corresponding to the remaining $818,508 of the increased settlement payment (approximately $150,773 of which would be effectively borne by dnl as the holder of approximately 18.4% of the company common stock on a fully diluted basis excluding out-of-the-money options). between february 18, 2000 and february 25, 2000, the company negotiated the terms of the settlement agreement, including the related releases, with am. parent indicated that it would not be willing to proceed with the transaction unless the releases became unconditional, and all pending litigation and arbitration proceedings were dismissed with prejudice, immediately upon signing and any portion of the cash settlement payment not paid upon signing would be deferred until the earlier of the consummation of the merger or july 31, 2000, the scheduled termination date of the merger agreement. these provisions ultimately were incorporated into the settlement agreement. on friday, february 25, 2000, the company completed negotiating the settlement agreement, releases and related documentation with am in a manner satisfactory to the company and parent and parent and the company completed negotiating the merger agreement and stockholders agreement. later that evening, the settlement agreement, the merger agreement, the stockholders agreement, the yesner employment agreement and the indemnity releases were executed by all relevant parties (including, in the case of the stockholders agreement, all holders of series c shares). the merger was publicly announced prior to the opening of trading on the nyse on monday, february 28, 2000. on march 8, 2000, purchaser commenced the offer. 11. purpose of the offer and the merger; plans for the company; the merger agreement, the stockholders agreement and other agreements; other matters. the purpose of the offer and the merger is to enable purchaser to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. the offer is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be effected promptly. the purpose of the merger is to acquire all outstanding shares not acquired pursuant to the offer or otherwise. 16 parent intends, as soon as possible after consummation of the offer and in accordance with the merger agreement, to obtain representation on the company's board of directors proportionate to its then share ownership. parent and l'oreal believe the acquisition of the company will enable them to build further on the significant progress achieved in the ethnic beauty market following the acquisition of soft sheen in 1998. the acquisition is a further strategic step to enhance the l'oreal group's position in ethnic

the offer or the effective date of the merger (the 'initial term'). at the end of the initial term, the yesner employment agreement will remain in effect for additional one-year terms unless either party has given written notice to the other party 90 days prior to the expiration. mr. yesner will receive an annual base salary of $375,000 through december 31, 2000, $420,000 for the period january 1, 2001 through december 31, 2001 and not less than $420,000 for the period from january 1, 2002 through the remainder of the initial term. this base salary may be increased, but not decreased, by parent at any time. mr. yesner will receive a guaranteed bonus of $150,000 for parent's 2000 fiscal year and for the remainder of the term of employment will be eligible to receive, in the sole discretion of parent, an annual bonus of up to 30% of mr. yesner's base salary at such time. mr. yesner is also entitled to the payment of a retention bonus of $2,250,000 (the 'retention bonus') following the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration of the initial term (provided mr. yesner is employed by parent on the last day thereof), (ii) mr. yesner's death or disability and (iii) the termination of mr. yesner's employment without 'cause' or for 'good reason' (each as defined in the yesner employment agreement). 25 mr. yesner will participate in parent's stock incentive plan maintained for the benefit of the senior executives of parent. parent will credit $100,000 to mr. yesner's phantom stock account for the 2000 fiscal year and for each successive completed fiscal year of employment parent will credit mr. yesner's account with an amount equal to mr. yesner's annual bonus actually awarded in such year. the yesner employment agreement provides that if mr. yesner is terminated without 'cause' or resigns for 'good reason' mr. yesner will receive the following: (i) the sum of his remaining base salary, (ii) any bonus payment mr. yesner would have received had he worked the balance of the initial term or, if applicable, during the balance of any renewal term, (iii) the retention bonus if the yesner employment agreement is terminated within the initial term, (iv) continuation of certain health and welfare benefits, and (v) any other compensation and benefits as may be provided in accordance with any applicable plans, programs or agreements of parent. the yesner employment agreement also provides that if mr. yesner is terminated for 'cause' or resigns without 'good reason', mr. yesner will not be entitled to any additional compensation, except for any compensation or benefits as may be provided in accordance with any applicable plans, programs or agreements of parent. the yesner employment agreement provides that mr. yesner will not compete, directly or indirectly, within any geographic area in which parent or its affiliates are doing business for a period of three years following the date of mr. yesner's termination for any reason (the 'restriction period'). in consideration of such restriction, mr. yesner will receive the following: (i) during the first two years of the restriction period a payment of $500,000 per year and (ii) during the last year of the restriction period a payment of $400,000. if mr. yesner voluntarily terminates his employment (other than due to disability or for 'good reason') during the initial term, purchaser may elect to waive the non-compete provisions in the yesner employment agreement, in which case, parent would not be liable to pay any amounts during the restriction period. upon the commencement of the initial term, the yesner employment agreement will supersede mr. yesner's current employment arrangements with the company. other matters statutory requirements. in general, under the dgcl, a merger of two delaware corporations requires the adoption of a resolution by the board of directors of each of the corporations desiring to merge approving an agreement of merger containing provisions with respect to certain statutorily specified areas and the approval of such agreement of merger by the stockholders of each corporation by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on such matter. assuming that the number of shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis does not increase from the number outstanding on february 25, 2000 and that the minimum condition is satisfied, upon consummation of the offer purchaser would own sufficient shares to enable it to satisfy the stockholder approval requirement to approve the merger. purchaser intends to seek to consummate the merger with the company as promptly as practicable after consummation of the offer. appraisal rights. no appraisal rights are available in connection with the offer. however, if the merger is consummated, stockholders of the company would have certain rights under section 262 of the dgcl to dissent and demand appraisal of, and payment in cash of the fair value of, their shares. such rights, if the statutory procedures were complied with, could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value (excluding any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) required to be paid in cash to such dissenting holders for their shares. any such judicial determination of the fair value of shares could be based upon considerations other than, or in addition to, the price paid in the offer and the market value of the shares, including asset values and the investment value of the shares. the value so determined could be more or less than the purchase price per share pursuant to the offer or the consideration per share to be paid in the merger. the foregoing summary of the rights of dissenting stockholders under the dgcl does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by stockholders desiring to exercise any available dissenters' rights. the preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights require strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the dgcl. 26 'going private' transactions. the commission has adopted rule 13e-3 under the exchange act which is applicable to certain 'going private' transactions and which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the merger or another business combination following the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer in which purchaser seeks to acquire the remaining shares not held by it. however, rule 13e-3 would be inapplicable if (i) the shares are deregistered under the exchange act prior to the merger or other business combination or (ii) the merger or other business combination is consummated within one year after the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer and the amount paid per share in the merger or other business combination is at least equal to the amount paid per share in the offer. if applicable, rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial information concerning the fairness of the proposed transaction and the consideration offered to minority stockholders in such transaction be filed with the commission and disclosed to stockholders prior to the consummation of the transaction. 12. source and amount of funds. the offer and the merger are not subject to any financing condition. the total amount of funds required by purchaser and parent to consummate the offer and the merger, to pay related fees and expenses and to retire outstanding indebtedness of the company which may become due as a result of the offer and the merger is estimated to be approximately $235 million. purchaser expects to obtain these funds in the form of capital contributions and/or loans from parent. parent expects to obtain these funds from an existing u.s. commercial paper program and/or uncommitted short-term lines of credit with commercial banks, all of which are guaranteed by l'oreal. parent expects that it will refinance short-term borrowings utilized to consummate the offer and the merger substantially from capital contributions from l'oreal. 13. dividends and distributions. in the merger agreement, the company has agreed not to declare, set aside or pay any dividend on, or make any other distribution in respect of, any of its capital stock, except for dividends by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company to the company or another wholly owned subsidiary of the company; or, directly or indirectly, to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire, issue, deliver or sell, any additional shares (other than issuances of shares upon conversion of class c shares or pursuant to the exercise of options under the option plans), or any shares of any other class of capital stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or rights, warrants or options, of any kind, to acquire, any capital stock. if, on or after the date of the merger agreement, the company declares or pays any dividend on the shares or any distribution (including, without limitation, the issuance of additional shares pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split, the issuance of other securities or the issuance of rights for the purchase of any securities) with respect to the shares that is payable or distributable to stockholders of record on a date prior to the transfer into the name of purchaser or its nominees or transferees on the company's stock transfer records of the shares purchased pursuant to the offer, and if shares are purchased in the offer, then, without prejudice to purchaser's rights under section 14, (i) the purchase price per share payable by purchaser pursuant to the offer shall be reduced by the amount of any such cash dividend or cash distribution and (ii) any such non-cash dividend, distribution, issuance, proceeds or right to be received by the tendering stockholders shall (a) be received and held by the tendering stockholders for the account of purchaser and will be required to be promptly remitted and transferred by each tendering stockholder to the depositary for the account of purchaser, accompanied by appropriate documentation of transfer or (b) at the direction of purchaser, be exercised for the benefit of purchaser, in which case the proceeds of such exercise will promptly be remitted to purchaser. pending such remittance and subject to applicable law, purchaser will be entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of any such non-cash dividend, distribution, issuance, proceeds or right and may withhold the entire purchase price or deduct from the purchase price the amount or value thereof, as determined by purchaser in its sole discretion. 14. certain conditions of the offer. notwithstanding any other provision of the offer or the merger agreement, purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment, or subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the commission, including rule 14e-1(c) of the exchange act (relating to purchaser's obligation to pay for or return tendered shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the offer), pay for, and may (subject to any such rule or regulation) delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered shares, and may (except as provided in the merger agreement) amend or terminate 27 the offer as to any shares not then paid for, if (i) at the expiration date, the minimum condition has not been satisfied or any waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement under the hsr act and the south african competition act shall not have expired or terminated or (ii) at any time on or after february 25, 2000 and before the expiration date, any of the following events shall have occurred and remain in effect: (a) there shall have been any law or order promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the offer, the merger or the stockholders agreement by any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent governmental or regulatory authority which (1) prohibits, or imposes any material limitations on, parent's or purchaser's ownership or operation (or that of any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) of any portion of their or the company's businesses or assets which is material to the business of all such entities taken as a whole, or compels parent or purchaser (or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) to dispose of or hold separate any portion of their or the company's business or assets which is material to the business of all such entities taken as a whole, (2) prohibits, restrains or makes illegal the acceptance for payment, payment for or purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the consummation of the merger, (3) imposes material limitations on the ability of purchaser or parent (or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) effectively to acquire or to hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of company common stock purchased pursuant to the offer, including, without limitation, the right to vote such shares of company common stock on all matters properly presented to the company's stockholders or (4) imposes material limitations on the ability of purchaser or parent (or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) effectively to control in any material respect any material portion of the business or assets of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; (b) there shall be threatened, instituted or pending any action, suit or proceeding brought by a governmental or regulatory authority challenging the acquisition by parent or purchaser of shares of company common stock or otherwise seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the offer, the merger or the stockholders agreement or seeking to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) above; (c) the representations and warranties made by the company in the merger agreement that are subject to, or qualified by, 'company material adverse effect' or other materiality qualification shall not be true and correct, or the representations and warranties made by the company in the merger agreement that are not so qualified shall not be true and correct in any respect which could reasonably be expected to have a company material adverse effect, in either case as of the date of the consummation of the offer as though made on and as of such date or, in the case of representations and warranties made as of a specific date earlier than the date of the consummation of the offer, on and as of such earlier date; (d) the representation and warranty made by the company in the merger agreement with respect to effectiveness of, and the nonexistence of a breach, violation or default under, the settlement agreement, and the related mutual releases entered into in connection therewith, shall not be true and correct in any respect as of the date of the consummation of the offer as though made on and as of such date, or there shall be instituted or pending any action, suit or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of such releases, the settlement agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby; (e) the company shall not have performed and complied with, in all material respects, each agreement and covenant required by the merger agreement to be performed or complied with by it; or (f) the merger agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. the merger agreement defines 'company material adverse effect' as any failures, changes or effects which, individually or in the aggregate, are not having and could not be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and/or of carson south africa and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. the merger agreement defines 'governmental or regulatory authority' as any court, 28 tribunal, arbitrator, authority, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of the united states, the european union or other supranational body, any foreign country or any domestic or foreign state, county, city or other political subdivision. the merger agreement defines 'subsidiary', with respect to any party, as any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which more than 50% of either the equity interests in, or the voting control of, such corporation or other organization is, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or otherwise, beneficially owned by such party and includes, without limitation, carson south africa. the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of parent and purchaser, may be asserted by parent and purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition and, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, may be waived by parent and purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of parent and purchaser. the failure by parent or purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 15. certain legal matters; required regulatory approvals. except as described in section 14 or this section 15, based on information provided by the company, none of the company, purchaser or parent is aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the business of the company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by the acquisition of shares by parent or purchaser pursuant to the offer, the merger or otherwise, or any approval or other action by any governmental, administrative or regulatory agency or authority, domestic or foreign, that would be required prior to the acquisition of shares by purchaser pursuant to the offer, the merger or otherwise. should any such approval or other action be required, purchaser and parent presently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought, except as described below under 'state antitakeover statutes.' while, except as otherwise described in this offer to purchase, purchaser does not presently intend to delay the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares tendered pursuant to the offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in consequences adverse to the company's business or that certain parts of the company's business might not have to be disposed of, or other substantial conditions complied with, in the event that such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken or in order to obtain any such approval or other action. if certain types of adverse action are taken with respect to the matters discussed below, purchaser could decline to accept for payment, or pay for, any shares tendered. see section 14 for certain conditions to the offer, including conditions with respect to governmental actions. federal reserve board regulations. regulations g, u and x (the 'margin regulations') of the federal reserve board restrict the extension or maintenance of credit for the purpose of buying or carrying margin stock, including the shares, if the credit is secured directly or indirectly by margin stock. such secured credit may not be extended or maintained in an amount that exceeds the maximum loan value of all the direct and indirect collateral securing the credit, including margin stock and other collateral. the financing of the offer will not be directly or indirectly secured by the shares or other securities which constitute margin stock. accordingly, all financing of the offer will be in full compliance with the margin regulations. state antitakeover statutes. section 203 of the dgcl, in general, prohibits a delaware corporation, such as the company, from engaging in a 'business combination' (defined as a variety of transactions, including mergers) with an 'interested stockholder' (defined generally as a person that is the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the subject corporation) for a period of three years following the date that such person became an interested stockholder unless, prior to the date such person became an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. in the merger agreement the company has represented that, by virtue of the approval of the company's board of directors, the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl are not applicable to the merger, the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 29 a number of states have adopted laws and regulations that purport to apply to attempts to acquire corporations that are incorporated in such states, or whose business operations have substantial economic effects in such states, or which have substantial assets, security holders, employees, principal executive officers or principal places of business in such states. in edgar v. mite corp., the supreme court of the united states (the 'supreme court') invalidated on constitutional grounds the illinois business takeover statute, which, as a matter of state securities law, made certain corporate acquisitions more difficult. however, in 1987, in cts corp. v. dynamics corp. of america, the supreme court held that the state of indiana may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, with respect to those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders. the state law before the supreme court was by its terms applicable only to corporations that had a substantial number of stockholders in the state and were incorporated there. parent and purchaser do not believe that the antitakeover laws and regulations of any state other than the state of delaware will by their terms apply to the offer, and, except as described above with respect to section 203 of the dgcl, neither parent nor purchaser has attempted to comply with any state antitakeover statute or regulations. purchaser reserves the right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law purportedly applicable to the offer and nothing in this offer to purchase or any action taken in connection with the offer is intended as a waiver of such right. if it is asserted that any state antitakeover statute is applicable to the offer and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the offer, purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or to receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities, and purchaser might be unable to accept for payment or pay for shares tendered pursuant to the offer or may be delayed in consummating the offer. in such case, purchaser may not be obligated to accept for payment, or pay for, any shares tendered pursuant to the offer. see section 14. antitrust. the offer and the merger are subject to the hsr act, which provides that certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the antitrust division of the department of justice (the 'antitrust division') and the federal trade commission (the 'ftc') and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. parent and the company filed their notification and report forms with respect to the offer under the hsr act on march 7, 2000. the waiting period under the hsr act with respect to the offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., new york city time, on march 22, 2000, unless early termination of the waiting period is granted. however, the antitrust division or the ftc may extend the waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary material from parent or the company. if such a request is made, such waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m., new york city time, on the tenth day after substantial compliance by parent with such request. only one extension of the waiting period pursuant to a request for additional information is authorized by the hsr act. therefore, any further extension of the waiting period may occur only with the consent of parent. in practice, complying with a request for additional information or material can take a significant amount of time. in addition, if the antitrust division or the ftc raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction, the parties frequently engage in negotiations with the relevant governmental agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues and may agree to delay consummation of the transaction while such negotiations continue. the relevant governmental agency may also seek to prevent the consummation of the transaction as discussed below. purchaser will not accept for payment shares tendered pursuant to the offer unless and until the waiting period requirements imposed by the hsr act with respect to the offer have been satisfied. see section 14. the ftc and the antitrust division frequently scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as purchaser's acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer and the merger. at any time before or after purchaser's acquisition of shares, the antitrust division or the ftc could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise seeking divestiture of shares acquired by purchaser or divestiture of substantial assets of parent or its subsidiaries. private parties, as well as state governments, may also bring legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. there can be no assurance that a challenge the offer or other acquisition of shares by 30 purchaser on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the result. see section 14 for certain conditions to the offer, including conditions with respect to litigation and certain governmental actions. as used in this offer to purchase, 'antitrust laws' mean and include the sherman act, as amended, the clayton act, as amended, the hsr act, the federal trade commission act, as amended, and all other federal and state statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines, and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade. south african competition law. the offer and the merger are subject to the competition act no. 89 of 1998 ('the south african competition act'), which provides that certain change of control transactions having an effect within the republic of south africa require the approval of, and the filing of certain information with, the south african competition commission (the 'competition commission') and the satisfaction of certain waiting period requirements. a notification of the merger was filed with the competition commission on march 6, 2000. the competition commission must, within 30 days after receiving the notice, either (i) approve the merger by issuing a clearance certificate; (ii) approve the merger subject to any conditions; (iii) prohibit implementation of the merger; or (iv) issue an extension certificate to extend the period in which it can consider the proposed merger by a period not exceeding 60 days. if the competition commission has not taken any action within the initial 30-day or 60-day extension period, it will be deemed to have approved the merger. if the competition commission prohibits the merger or approves the merger subject to any conditions, the parties may appeal to the competition tribunal within 15 days after the commission's decision in the matter. there is the possibility of a further appeal to the competition appeal court, although this has not yet been constituted. no party to a merger may implement the merger until it has received the approval of the competition commission or the competition tribunal as the case may be. private parties who can show an interest in the matter, as well as the south african minister of trade and industry and affected trade unions, may also participate in the merger proceedings. there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on competition grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the result. 16. certain fees and expenses. lazard freres is acting as dealer manager in connection with the offer and is acting also as financial advisor to parent in connection with the proposed acquisition of the company. parent has agreed to pay lazard freres for its services the following fees: (i) a cash fee in the amount of $100,000 payable upon the execution of the engagement letter, dated march 30, 1999, between parent and lazard freres, (ii) a cash fee in the amount of $150,000 payable upon the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction whereby parent or one or more of parent's affiliates acquires control of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the company or a substantial equity interest in the company and the commencement of a tender offer and (iii) a cash fee equal to $2,500,000 payable at the closing of any such transaction, to which amount the fees paid by parent pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be credited. parent has agreed to reimburse lazard freres for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by lazard freres, which expenses, other than legal expenses, shall not exceed $50,000 without the prior consent of parent. in addition, parent has agreed to indemnify lazard freres against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. lazard freres and its affiliates have from time to time rendered, and continue to render, various investment banking services to parent and its affiliates for which they are paid customary fees. in the ordinary course of its business, lazard freres and its affiliates may actively trade in the shares for their own account and for the account of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in the shares. innisfree m&a incorporated has been retained by purchaser as information agent in connection with the offer. the information agent may contact holders of shares by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail and personal interview and may request brokers, dealers and other nominee stockholders to forward material relating to the offer to beneficial owners. the information agent will receive customary compensation for its services in connection with the offer, will be reimbursed for its 31 reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. in addition, chase mellon shareholder services, l.l.c. has been retained as the depositary. the depositary has not been retained to make solicitations or recommendations in its role as depositary. the depositary will receive customary compensation for its services in connection with the offer, will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith. except as described above, purchaser will not pay any fees or commissions to any broker, dealer or other person (other than the information agent and the dealer manager) for soliciting tenders of shares pursuant to the offer. brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust companies and other nominees will, upon request, be reimbursed by purchaser for customary clerical and mailing expenses incurred by them in forwarding materials to their customers. 17. miscellaneous. the offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of shares residing in any jurisdiction in which the making of the offer or the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. however, purchaser may, in its discretion, take such action as it may deem necessary to make the offer in any jurisdiction and extend the offer to holders of shares in such jurisdiction. in any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the offer will be deemed to be made on behalf of purchaser by the dealer manager or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction. purchaser has filed with the commission the schedule to, together with exhibits, pursuant to rule 14d-3 of the general rules and regulations under the exchange act, furnishing certain additional information with respect to the offer, and may file amendments thereto. such schedule to and any amendments thereto, including exhibits, may be examined and copies may be obtained from the office of the commission in the same manner as described in section 8 with respect to information concerning the company. no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation on behalf of purchaser not contained in this offer to purchase or in the letter of transmittal and, if given or made, any such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized. neither the delivery of the offer to purchase nor any purchase pursuant to the offer shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of purchaser or the company since the date as of which information is furnished or the date of this offer to purchase. crayon acquisition corp. march 8, 2000 32 schedule i directors and executive

('purchaser') and a wholly-owned subsidiary of cosmair, inc., a delaware corporation ('parent'), the above-described shares of class a common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the 'shares'), of carson, inc., a delaware corporation (the 'company'), pursuant to purchaser's offer to purchase all outstanding shares at a price of $5.20 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the offer to purchase, dated march 8, 2000, and in this letter of transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto or hereto, collectively constitute the 'offer'). the undersigned understands that purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase all or any portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve purchaser of its obligations under the offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the offer. receipt of the offer is hereby acknowledged. the offer is being made pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of february 25, 2000 (the 'merger agreement'), among parent, purchaser and the company. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (and if the offer is extended or amended, the terms of any such extension or amendment), subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, purchaser all right, title and interest in and to, and any and all claims in respect of or arising or having arisen as a result of the undersigned's status as a holder of, all the shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and all non-cash dividends, distributions, rights, other shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after february 25, 2000 (collectively, 'distributions')) and irrevocably constitutes and appoints the depositary the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned with respect to such shares (and all distributions), with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to (i) deliver certificates for such shares (and any and all distributions), or transfer ownership of such shares (and any and all distributions) on the account books maintained by the book-entry transfer facility, together, in any such case, with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity, to or upon the order of purchaser, (ii) present such shares (and any and all distributions) for transfer on the books of the company and (iii) receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such shares (and any and all distributions), all in accordance with the terms of the offer. by executing this letter of transmittal, the undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each designee of purchaser as the attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, each with full power of substitution, to vote at any annual or special meeting of the company's stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof or otherwise in such manner as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper with respect to, to execute any written consent concerning any matter as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper with respect to, and to otherwise act as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper with respect to, all of the shares (and any and all distributions) tendered hereby and accepted for payment by purchaser. this appointment will be effective if and when, and only to the extent that, purchaser accepts such shares for payment pursuant to the offer. this power of attorney and proxy are irrevocable and are granted in consideration of the acceptance for payment of such shares in accordance with the terms of the offer. such acceptance for payment shall, without further action, revoke any prior powers of attorney and proxies granted by the undersigned at any time with respect to such shares (and any and all distributions), and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may be given by the undersigned with respect thereto (and, if given, will not be deemed effective). purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for shares or other securities to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon purchaser's acceptance for payment of such shares, purchaser must be able to exercise full voting, consent and other rights with respect to such shares (and any and all distributions), including voting at any meeting of the company's stockholders. the undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the shares tendered hereby and all distributions, that the undersigned owns the shares tendered hereby within the meaning of rule 14e-4 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the 'exchange act'), that the tender of the tendered shares complies with rule 14e-4 under the exchange act, and that when the same are accepted for payment by purchaser, purchaser will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title thereto and to all distributions, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances and the same will not be subject to any adverse claims. the undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the depositary or purchaser to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the shares tendered hereby and all distributions. in addition, the undersigned shall remit and transfer promptly to the depositary for the account of purchaser all distributions in respect of the shares tendered hereby, accompanied by appropriate documentation of transfer, and, pending such remittance and transfer or appropriate assurance thereof, purchaser shall be entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of each such distribution and may withhold the entire purchase price of the shares tendered hereby or deduct from such purchase price the amount or value of such distribution as determined by purchaser in its sole discretion. all authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, successors and assigns of the undersigned. except as stated in the offer, this tender is irrevocable. the undersigned understands that the valid tender of shares pursuant to any one of the procedures described in section 3 of the offer to purchase and in the instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer (and if the offer is extended or amended, the terms or conditions of any such extension or amendment). without limiting the foregoing, if the price to be paid in the offer is amended in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the price to be paid to the undersigned will be the amended price notwithstanding the fact that a different price is stated in this letter of transmittal. the undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances described in the offer to purchase, purchaser may not be required to accept for payment any of the shares tendered hereby. unless otherwise indicated herein in the box entitled 'special payment instructions,' please issue the check for the purchase price of all shares purchased and/or return any certificates for shares not tendered or accepted for payment in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appearing above under 'description of shares tendered.' similarly, unless otherwise indicated under 'special delivery instructions,' please mail the check for the purchase price of all shares purchased and/or return any certificates for shares not tendered or not accepted for payment (and any accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the address(es) of the registered holder(s) appearing above under 'description of shares tendered.' in the event that the boxes entitled 'special payment instructions' and 'special delivery instructions' are both completed, please issue the check for the purchase price of all shares purchased and/or return any certificates evidencing shares not tendered or not accepted for payment (and any accompanying documents, as appropriate) in the name(s) of, and deliver such check and/or return any such certificates (and any accompanying documents, as appropriate) to, the person(s) so indicated. unless otherwise indicated herein in the box entitled 'special payment instructions,' please credit any shares tendered herewith by book-entry transfer that are not accepted for payment by crediting the account at the book-entry transfer facility designated above. the undersigned recognizes that purchaser has no obligation, pursuant to the 'special payment instructions,' to transfer any shares from the name of the registered holder thereof if purchaser does not accept for payment any of the shares so tendered.

guaranteed delivery procedures. this letter of transmittal is to be completed by stockholders of the company either if share certificates are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an agent's message is utilized, if delivery of shares is to be made by book-entry transfer pursuant to the procedures described herein and in section 3 of the offer to purchase. in order for shares to be validly tendered pursuant to the offer, (i) this letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry delivery of shares, and any other documents required by this letter of transmittal must be received by the depositary at one of its addresses specified on the back cover of the offer to purchase on or prior to the expiration date and either share certificates representing tendered shares must be received by the depositary, or such shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer described herein and in section 3 of the offer to purchase and a book-entry confirmation must be received by the depositary, in each case on or prior to the expiration date, or (ii) the guaranteed delivery procedures described herein and in section 3 of the offer to purchase must be complied with. if a stockholder desires to tender shares pursuant to the offer and such stockholder's share certificates are not immediately available or time will not permit all required documents to reach the depositary on or prior to the expiration date, or the procedures for book-entry transfer cannot be complied on a timely basis, such shares may nevertheless be tendered if all of the following guaranteed delivery procedures described herein and in section 3 of the offer to purchase are duly complied with. pursuant to such guaranteed delivery procedures, (i) such tender is made by or through an eligible institution, (ii) a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery, substantially in the form made available by purchaser, is received by the depositary, as provided below, on or prior to the expiration date and (iii) the share certificates (or a book-entry confirmation) representing all tendered shares, in proper form for transfer, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and any other documents required by the letter of transmittal are received by the depositary, within three new york stock exchange trading days after the date of execution of such notice of guaranteed delivery. the term 'agent's message' means a message, transmitted by the book-entry transfer facility to, and received by, the depositary and forming a part of the book-entry confirmation, which states that the book-entry transfer facility has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in such book-entry transfer facility tendering the shares which are the subject of the book-entry confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that purchaser may enforce such agreement against the participant. the signatures on this letter of transmittal cover the shares tendered hereby. the method of delivery of certificates representing the shares, this letter of transmittal and all other required documents, including delivery through the book-entry transfer facility, is at the election and sole risk of the tendering stockholder. the shares will be deemed delivered only when actually received by the depositary (including, in the case of a book-entry transfer, by book-entry confirmation). if delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. in all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. no alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted, and no fractional shares will be purchased. all tendering stockholders, by executing this letter of transmittal (or facsimile thereof), waive any right to receive any notice of acceptance of their shares for payment. 3. inadequate space. if the space provided herein under 'description of shares tendered' is inadequate, the number of shares tendered and the share certificate numbers with respect to such shares should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto. 4. partial tenders. (not applicable to stockholders who tender by book-entry transfer). if fewer than all the shares evidenced by any share certificate delivered to the depositary herewith are to be tendered hereby, fill in the number of shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled 'number of shares tendered.' in any such case, new certificate(s) for the remainder of the shares that were evidenced by the old certificates will be sent to the registered holder, unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this letter of transmittal, as soon as practicable after the expiration date or the termination of the offer. all shares represented by certificates delivered to the depositary will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated. 5. signatures on letter of transmittal; stock powers and endorsements. if this letter of transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the shares tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on the face of the certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever. if any of the shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this letter of transmittal. if any of the tendered shares are registered in different names on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate letters of transmittal as there are different registrations of certificates. if this letter of transmittal or any share certificate or stock power is signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to purchaser of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted. if this letter of transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of share certificates or separate stock powers are required unless payment or certificates for shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be issued in the name of a person other than the registered holder(s). signatures on any such share certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an eligible institution. if this letter of transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered holder(s) of the shares evidenced by certificates listed and transmitted hereby, the share certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s) on the share certificates. signature(s) on any such share certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an eligible institution as described in instruction 1 hereto. 6. stock transfer taxes. except as otherwise provided in this instruction 6, purchaser will pay all stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer and sale of any shares to it or its order pursuant to the offer. if, however, payment of the purchase price of any shares purchased is to be made to, or if certificates for shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be registered in the name of, any person other than the registered holder(s), or if tendered certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing this letter of transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s) or such other person or otherwise) payable on account of the transfer to such other person will be deducted from the purchase price of such shares purchased unless evidence satisfactory to purchaser of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom is submitted. except as provided in this instruction 6, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the share certificates evidencing the shares tendered hereby. 7. special payment and delivery instructions. if a check for the purchase price of any shares accepted for payment is to be issued in the name of, and/or share certificates for shares not accepted for payment or not tendered are to be issued in the name of and/or returned to, a person other than the signer of this letter of transmittal or if a check is to be sent, and/or such certificates are to be returned, to a person other than the signer of this letter of transmittal, or to an address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this letter of transmittal should be completed. any stockholder(s) delivering shares by book-entry transfer may request that shares not purchased be credited to such account maintained at the book-entry transfer facility as such stockholder(s) may designate in the box entitled 'special payment instructions.' if no such instructions are given, any such shares not purchased will be returned by crediting the account at the book-entry transfer facility designated above as the account from which such shares were delivered. 8. requests for assistance or additional copies. questions and requests for assistance or additional copies of the offer to purchase, this letter of transmittal, the notice of guaranteed delivery and the guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9 may be directed to the information agent at its address and phone number specified at the end of this letter of transmittal. 9. waiver of conditions. subject to the merger agreement, purchaser reserves the absolute right in its sole discretion to waive, at any time or from time to time, any of the specified conditions of the offer, in whole or in part, in the case of any shares tendered. 10. backup withholding. under the federal income tax laws, the depositary will be required to withhold 31% of the amount of any payments made to certain stockholders pursuant to the offer. to prevent backup federal income tax withholding on payments made to certain stockholders with respect to the purchase price of shares purchased pursuant to the offer, each such stockholder must provide the depositary with his correct taxpayer identification number ('tin') and certify, under penalty of perjury, that he is not subject to backup federal income tax withholding by completing the substitute form w-9 included in the letter of transmittal. backup withholding is not an additional income tax. rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the irs. if backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the stockholder upon filing an income tax return. the stockholder is required to give the depositary the tin (i.e., social security number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the shares. if the shares are held in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed 'guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9' for additional guidance on which number to report. the box in part 3 of the substitute form w-9 may be checked if the tendering stockholder has not been issued a tin and has applied for a tin or intends to apply for a tin in the near future. if the box in part 3 is checked, the stockholder or other payee must also complete the certificate of awaiting taxpayer identification number below in order to avoid backup withholding. notwithstanding that the box in part 3 is checked and the certificate of awaiting taxpayer identification number is completed, the depositary will withhold 31% on all payments made prior to the time a properly certified tin is provided to the depositary. however, such amounts will be refunded to such stockholder if a tin is provided to the depositary within 60 days. certain stockholders (including, among others, most corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. noncorporate foreign stockholders should complete and sign the main signature form and a form w-8, certificate of foreign status, a copy of which may be obtained from the depositary, in order to avoid backup withholding. see the enclosed 'guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9' for more instructions. 11. lost, destroyed or stolen share certificates. if any certificate(s) representing shares has (have) been lost, destroyed or stolen, the stockholder should promptly notify the depositary by checking the box immediately preceding the special payment/special delivery instructions and indicating the number of shares lost. the stockholder will then be instructed as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace the share certificate(s). this letter of transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing lost, destroyed or stolen share certificates have been followed. important: this letter of transmittal (or facsimile hereof) together with any required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message, and any other required documents, must be received by the depositary prior to the expiration date and either certificates for tendered shares must be received by the depositary or shares must be delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer, in each case prior to the expiration date, or the tendering stockholder must comply with the procedures for guaranteed delivery. important tax information under the federal income tax laws, a stockholder whose tendered shares are accepted for payment is required to provide the depositary (as payer) with such stockholder's correct tin on substitute form w-9 below. if such stockholder is an individual, the tin is his social security number. if a tendering stockholder is subject to backup withholding, such stockholder must cross out item (2) of part 2 (the certification box) on the substitute form w-9. if the depositary is not provided with the correct tin, the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the internal revenue service. in addition, payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the offer may be subject to backup withholding. certain stockholders (including, among others, most corporations, and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting requirements. in order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt recipient, that stockholder must submit a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt status. such statements can be obtained from the depositary. exempt stockholders, other than foreign individuals, should furnish their tin, write 'exempt' on the face of the substitute form w-9 below, and sign, date and return the substitute form w-9 to the depositary. see the enclosed 'guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9' for additional instructions. if backup withholding applies, the depositary is required to withhold 31% of any payments made to the stockholder. backup withholding is not an additional income tax. rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the irs. if backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the stockholder upon filing an income tax return. purpose of substitute form w-9 to prevent backup withholding of federal income tax on payments made to certain stockholders with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the offer, the stockholder is required to notify the depositary of such stockholder's correct tin by completing the

consult the enclosed 'guidelines for certification of taxpayer identification number on substitute form w-9' for additional guidance on which number to report. if the tendering stockholder has not been issued a tin and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, such stockholder should write 'applied for' in the space provided for in the tin in part 1, and sign and date the substitute form w-9. if 'applied for' is written in part 1 and the depositary is not provided with a tin within sixty (60) days, the depositary will withhold 31% on all payments of the purchase price until a tin is provided to the depositary. payer's name: chasemellon shareholder services, l.l.c -

purpose of receiving payment from purchaser and transmitting payment to validly tendering stockholders whose shares have theretofore been accepted for payment. in all cases, payment for shares purchased pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (i) share certificates for such shares or a timely book-entry confirmation (as defined in section 2 of the offer to purchase) with respect to such shares and (ii) the letter of transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's message (as defined in section 2 of the offer to purchase) and (iii) any other documents required by the letter of transmittal. under no circumstances will interest on the purchase price for shares be paid by purchaser by reason of any delay in making such payment. the term "expiration date" means 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on tuesday, april 4, 2000, unless and until purchaser, in accordance with the terms of the offer and the merger agreement, shall have extended the period of time for which the offer is open, in which event the term "expiration date" shall mean the time and date at which the offer, as so extended by purchaser, shall expire (provided, however, that without the company's consent, the expiration date will not be extended beyond july 31, 2000). purchaser shall not have any obligation to pay interest on the purchase price for tendered shares whether or not purchaser exercises its right to extend the period of time during which the offer is open. any such extension will be followed by a public announcement thereof by no later than 9:00 a.m., new york city time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. during any such extension, all shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's shares. without limiting the manner in which purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, purchaser shall have no obligation to publish, advertise, or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a release to the dow jones news service or as otherwise may be required by law. except as otherwise provided in the offer to purchase, tenders of shares made pursuant to the offer are irrevocable. shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date and, unless theretofore accepted for payment as provided in the offer to purchase, may also be withdrawn at any time after may 6, 2000. for a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the offer to purchase. any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder, if different from that of the person who tendered such shares. if certificates evidencing shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the depositary, then prior to the physical release of such certificates, the tendering stockholder must also submit the serial numbers shown on the particular certificates evidencing the shares to be withdrawn, and the signature on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution, as defined in section 3 of the offer to purchase (except in the case of shares tendered for the account of the eligible institution). if shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer set forth in section 3 of the offer to purchase, the notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the book-entry transfer facility (as defined in section 2 of the offer to purchase) to be credited with the withdrawn shares. all questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by purchaser, in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding. any shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the offer, but may be retendered at any subsequent time prior to the expiration date by following any of the procedures described in section 3 of the offer to purchase. the company has provided purchaser with the company's stockholder list and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the offer to holders of shares. the offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and, if required, any other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of shares and will be furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or in the name of whose nominees, appear on the company's stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares by purchaser. the information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of rule 14d-6 under the exchange act is contained in the offer to purchase and is incorporated herein by reference. the offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal contain important information which should be read carefully

10017 attn: john d. sullivan ladies and gentlemen: you have requested certain information relating to crayon, inc., a delaware corporation (the 'company'), and its subsidiaries in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction between the company and/or its stockholders and you (a 'transaction'). as a condition to the furnishing of the requested information to you and your representatives (as defined below), you agree that (i) all information relating to the company and its subsidiaries furnished by or on behalf of the company to you or representatives, whether prior to or after your acceptance of this letter and irrespective of the form of communication, or learned by you in connection with visits to the company's facilities, in connection with your consideration of a transaction (such information, together with notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based thereon prepared by you or your representatives being referred to herein as the 'evaluation material') will be kept strictly confidential, (ii) the evaluation material will not be used in any way detrimental to the company or its stockholders and (iii) the evaluation material will be used solely for the purpose of determining the desirability of a transaction; provided, however, that the evaluation material may be disclosed to any of your representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of assisting you in evaluating a transaction (it being understood that such representatives will be informed by you of the contents of this agreement and that, by receiving such information, such representatives are agreeing to be bound by this agreement). the term 'evaluation material' does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) becomes available to you or any of your representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the company or its affiliates or representatives or (iii) is or has been independently developed by you or your representatives without reference to any evaluation material, provided that neither you nor any of your representatives is aware that such source is under an obligation (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to the company to keep such information confidential. for purposes hereof, the 'representatives' of any entity means such entity's directors, officers, employees, legal and financial advisors, accountants and other agents and representatives. you will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by any of your representatives and agree to take all reasonable measures to restrain your representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of evaluation material. in addition, you agree that, except with the prior written consent of the company or as required or permitted by this agreement, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, make any release to the press or other public disclosure concerning either (i) the existence of this letter or that the evaluation material has been made available to you or (ii) in the event that the company or any of its representatives engages in discussions or negotiations with you or your representatives, the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction, including the status thereof, except for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the opinion of your outside counsel, for you not to be in violation of or default under any applicable law, regulation, stock exchange rule or governmental order. if you propose to make any disclosure based upon such an opinion, you will deliver the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is reasonably practicable, and will in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the company and its representatives concerning the nature and scope of the information you propose to disclose. if you or any of your representatives are requested in any judicial or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any evaluation material, you will (i) give the company prompt notice of such request so that the company may seek an appropriate protective order and (ii) consult with the company as to the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such a request. you will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the company, at the company's expense, in the company's attempt to obtain such an order. if in the absence of a protective order you are nonetheless compelled to disclose evaluation material, the company agrees that you may make such disclosure without liability hereunder, provided that you give the company written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon the company's request and at its expense, use your reasonable efforts to obtain hereto. you hereby acknowledge that you may be disqualified from participating in a transaction if you fail to comply with the procedures and restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the following two paragraphs. as a further condition to the furnishing of the evaluation material, unless specifically requested in writing in advance by the company's board of directors, neither you nor any of your affiliates or associates (as such terms are defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the '1934 act')) will, and you and they will not assist or encourage others (including by providing financing) to, directly or indirectly, for a period of two (2) years from the date of this agreement (i) acquire or agree, offer, seek or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to acquire ownership (including but not limited to beneficial ownership (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the 1934 act)) of (x) the company or any of its assets or businesses, (y) any securities issued by the company or (z) any rights or options to acquire such ownership (including from a person other than the company), whether by means of a negotiated purchase of securities or assets, tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, recapitalization, restructuring or other extraordinary transaction (a 'business combination transaction'), (ii) engage in any 'solicitation' of 'proxies' (as such terms are used in the proxy rules promulgated under the 1934 act, but disregarding clause (iv) of rule 14a-1(1)(2) and including any exempt solicitation pursuant to rule 14a-2(b)(1) or (2)), or form, join or in any way participate in a 'group', (as defined under the 1934 act), with respect to any securities issued by the company, (iii) otherwise seek or propose to influence or control the board of directors, management or policies of the company, (iv) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the company to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, or (v) enter into any discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements or understandings with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. you also agree during such period not to request the company or any of its representatives to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence). notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall have the right for a 60-day period after the date hereof to deliver a written proposal for a business combination transaction to the chairman of the executive committee of the company so long as you make no public disclosure concerning such proposal or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to require the company to make a public disclosure regarding such proposal. you hereby acknowledge that neither you nor any of your associates nor, to your knowledge without making independent inquiry, any of your affiliates is on the date hereof the beneficial owner of any shares of capital stock of the company. if, during the 90-day period after the date hereof, the company enters into an agreement with an unrelated third party which restricts the ability of such third party to make a proposal for or engage in a business combination transaction with the company that is in any way less restrictive than the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, then the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to be automatically amended to conform with such less restrictive provisions of the third party agreement. the company will promptly notify you of the terms of any such less restrictive third party agreement. you further agree that, for a period of two years from the date hereof, neither you nor any of your affiliates will solicit to employ or employ any officer or management employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries, so long as they are employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries, without obtaining the prior written consent of the company. the term 'solicit to employ' does not include general solicitations of employment not specifically directed towards employees of the company and its subsidiaries. it is expressly understood by the parties hereto that this agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitutes an agreement to consummate a transaction or to enter into a definitive transaction agreement, and neither the company nor you will have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to a transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression by either party hereto or their respective representatives unless and until a definitive agreement relating thereto between the company and you is executed and delivered, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. you further acknowledge that (i) the company and its representatives shall be free to negotiate with any other person and enter into a definitive agreement with regard to a transaction without prior notice to you or any other person, (ii) the company reserves the right to reject any and all proposals made by you or any of your representatives with regard to a possible transaction and to terminate any discussions or negotiations with you at any time and (iii) neither the company nor any of its affiliates or representatives nor any third party with whom the company enters into any agreement for, or completes, a business combination transaction shall have any liability to you arising out of or relating to such a business combination transaction (other than any liability arising under a definitive transaction agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof). you and the company acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this agreement by the other, and that in addition to all other remedies which any party hereto may have, each party reasonable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. if at any time you decide that you do not wish to proceed with a transaction or, if earlier, upon the request of the company, you will promptly (and in no event later than five (5) business days after such request) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the company all copies of the evaluation material furnished to you by or on behalf of the company and destroy or cause to be destroyed all evaluation material prepared by you or any of your representatives. notwithstanding the return or destruction of the evaluation material, you and your representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations hereunder. although the company will endeavor to include in the evaluation material information it believes to be relevant to the evaluation of a transaction, you hereby acknowledge that neither the company nor any of its affiliates or representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the evaluation material. you agree that neither the company nor any of its affiliates or representatives will have any liability to you or your representatives resulting from use of any of the evaluation material. you hereby acknowledge that you are aware (and that your representatives who have been apprised of this agreement and your consideration of a transaction have been, or upon becoming as appraised will be, advised) of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on a person possessing material nonpublic information about a company. in this regard, you hereby agree that which you are in possession of material nonpublic information with respect to the company and its subsidiaries, you will not purchase or sell any securities of the company, or communicate such information to any third party, in violation of any such laws. in consideration for access to the evaluation material which you have requested, you agree not to initiate or maintain contract (other than in the ordinary course of business) with any officer, director, employee or agent of the company or any of its subsidiaries regarding its business, operations, prospectus, finances or any other material pertaining to the company or to any proposed transaction, other than the individuals listed on schedule i hereto. it is understood that such individuals will arrange for appropriate contracts for due diligence purposes. it is further understood that all (i) communications regarding a possible transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to one of the individuals listed on schedule i 6 will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. no failure or delay by any party herein in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. this agreement (i) contains the sale and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii) may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the company and you, and (iii) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. if the foregoing correctly sets forth our agreement with respect to the matters set forth herein, please so indicate by signing two copies of this agreement and returning one of such signed copies to us for our signature, whereupon this agreement will constitute our binding agreement with respect to the matters set forth herein. very truly yours, carson, inc.
