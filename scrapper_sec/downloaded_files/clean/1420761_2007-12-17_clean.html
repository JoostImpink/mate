thereunder. under the lock-up agreements, each of the locked-up shareholders has agreed, among other things, to (a) accept the offer, (b) deposit or cause to be deposited under the offer and not withdraw, subject to certain exceptions, all of the common shares which such locked-up shareholder owns or over which it exercises direction or control and all bonus shares issued to such locked-up shareholder, and (c) exercise or conditionally exercise all of the options currently owned by such locked-up shareholder and to deposit under the offer and not withdraw, subject to certain exceptions, all of the common shares issued upon such exercise or conditional exercise of options, representing an aggregate of 14,062,302 common shares or approximately 42.5% of the common shares on a fully-diluted basis, except in limited circumstances, some of which are discussed below. the locked-up shareholders have agreed not to withdraw their deposited common shares from the offer during the term of the lock up agreements other than pursuant to the termination provisions of the lock up agreements described below or for the purpose of tendering to a superior proposal (as defined below) if, and only if, (i) the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and (ii) if an event giving rise to a non-completion payment with respect to the offer in an amount equal to $15,900,000 payable by the issuer to the offeror (or its designee) has occurred under the terms of the support agreement, such non-completion payment shall have first been paid. the lock-up agreements define a &#147;superior proposal&#148; as an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal made after december 5, 2007 that: (a) did not result from a breach of the issuer&#146;s non-solicitation covenant; (b) is made for all of the common shares;

(d) is not subject to any due diligence and/or access condition; (e) in respect of which the board of directors of the issuer has determined in good faith (after receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel) that the failure to recommend such acquisition proposal to shareholders of the issuer would be a breach of its fiduciary duties; and (f) in respect of which the board of directors of the issuer has determined in good faith after receipt of advice from its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such acquisition proposal is reasonably capable of completion without undue delay taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition proposal and the person making such acquisition proposal and would, if consummated in accordance with its terms (but not assuming away any risk of non-completion), result in a transaction more favourable to the shareholders of the issuer from a financial point of view than the offer (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the offer proposed by the offeror pursuant to the support agreement). each locked-up shareholder has agreed, among other things, that it will (a) immediately cease, cause its representatives to cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than the offeror or its representatives) with respect to any acquisition proposal or potential acquisition proposal, (b) not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, including through any representative, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries, proposals, offers or public announcements (or the submission or initiation of any of the foregoing) from any person regarding any acquisition proposal, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any information to, or have any discussions with or otherwise cooperate with, any person relating to an acquisition proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal; (c) not acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership or control of any additional common shares or options, other than any bonus shares or any common shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of options, (d) not option, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise convey or grant any options or common shares or any right or interest in any options or common shares, (e) not grant or agree to grant any proxy or other right to the common shares or options, or enter into any voting trust or pooling agreement with respect to the voting thereof, and (f) not take any action to encourage or assist any other person to do certain prohibited acts referred to in the lock-up agreements. in addition to the foregoing covenants, each locked-up shareholder (other than those locked-up shareholders that are not directors or officers of the issuer) has agreed that it will (a) promptly notify the offeror of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, that it receives or of which it becomes aware that relates to, constitutes or could lead to an acquisition proposal, or any request that it receives for discussions or negotiations relating to an acquisition proposal or any request for information relating to the issuer or its subsidiaries, and (b) use its reasonable efforts in its capacity as a shareholder of the issuer to oppose any proposed action by the issuer or its subsidiaries or any other person in respect of any acquisition proposal or which may adversely affect the take-up and payment for the common table of contents page 9 of 12 shares or which would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect in respect of the issuer. the lock-up agreements may be terminated by mutual written consent of the offeror and the relevant locked-up shareholder. the lock-up agreement may also be terminated by the offeror, subject to certain conditions, upon written notice if: (a) a superior proposal is made and (i) the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and (ii) if an event giving rise to a non-completion payment with respect to the offer in an amount equal to $15,900,000 payable by the issuer to the offeror (or its designee) has occurred under the support agreement, such non-completion payment shall have first been paid; (b) any of the locked-up shareholders has not complied in any material respect with its covenants under the relevant lock-up agreement (provided that such default is not rectified by the earlier of the date that is five days after notice of such default and the business day prior to the expiry time of the offer); (c) if any representation or warranty of any of the locked-up shareholders under the relevant lock-up agreement is untrue or incorrect in any material respect; or (d) any condition of the offer is not satisfied at the expiry time of the offer and the offeror elects not to waive such condition. the lock-up agreements may be terminated by a locked-up shareholder, subject to certain conditions, upon written notice if: (a) the offeror has not complied in any material respect with its covenants under the relevant lock-up agreement or if any representation or warranty of the offeror under the relevant lock-up agreement is untrue or incorrect in any material respect, and in each case, such non-compliance or inaccuracy is reasonably likely to prevent consummation of the offer and is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of the date which is five days after notice of such breach and the business day prior to the expiry time of the offer; (b) the offeror modifies or waives any term or condition of the offer in a manner contrary to the provisions of the relevant lock-up agreement; or (c) the offeror has not (for any reason other than the failure of the relevant locked-up shareholder to deposit its common shares) taken up and paid for all the common shares deposited under the offer in accordance with applicable laws. any termination of a lock-up agreement by a locked-up shareholder will only be effective with respect to such locked-up shareholder. each reporting person reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate. in particular, each reporting person may at any time and from time to time acquire common shares or securities convertible or exchangeable for common shares and/or dispose of common shares which it has acquired. any such transactions may be effected at any time and from time to time subject to any applicable limitations of the securities act of 1933, as amended. except as described herein, neither the reporting persons, nor, to the reporting persons&#146;
