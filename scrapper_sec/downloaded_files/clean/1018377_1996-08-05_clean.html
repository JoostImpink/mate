the price and availability of shares of the common stock, future developments at, and pertaining to, the issuer, other investment and business opportunities available to the filing persons and general economic conditions, and subject to the terms of the investor agreement to be entered into by and among the filing persons and the issuer (the "investor agreement"), the filing persons, or their

filing persons may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate 3,800,000 shares of the common stock, which constitutes approximately 26.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock. the filing

1996, plus the 3,800,000 shares of common stock to be acquired by the filing persons, which shares are deemed to be outstanding. to the best of the filing persons' knowledge and belief, none of the executive officers or the directors of any of the filing persons beneficially own any shares of the common stock. (b) pursuant to their joint right to acquire the common stock pursuant to the purchase agreement, the filing persons share the power to vote or to direct the vote and to dispose or to direct the disposition of the 3,800,000 shares of common stock of which the filing persons are the beneficial owners. reference is hereby made to item 6 for a description of the voting agreement among the filing persons and the issuer contained in the investor agreement.

shall be 30% so long as the investor agreement has not terminated and 35% from and after such termination until such time (subject to certain exceptions) as the filing persons and their affiliates beneficially own less than 15% of the then outstanding shares of the common stock at which time such percentage shall become 15%. upon the closing of the acquisition contemplated by the purchase agreement, the filing persons and the issuer have agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement and an investor agreement, which are attached hereto as exhibits a and b, respectively, to the purchase agreement, and are incorporated herein by reference. the registration rights agreement gives the holders of registrable securities (as therein defined) the right, subject to certain conditions, to (i) register their registrable securities pursuant to a registration proposed by the issuer for its own account or for the account of any other person, subject to customary "cut- backs"

of the voting power (as therein defined) of the issuer, (ii) solicit proxies with respect to securities of the issuer, (iii) take any public action for the purpose of convening a shareholders meeting of the issuer, (iv) make certain public announcements relating to the acquisition of voting securities of the issuer, (v) deposit voting securities of the issuer into a trust or subject the same to voting agreements, (vi) form or participate in a group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities of the issuer, (vii) disclose publicly any intention inconsistent with the foregoing or (viii) enter into any discussions or understandings with any third party with a view to any action prohibited by any of the foregoing. the investor agreement also restricts the filing persons' right to sell, transfer any beneficial interest in, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose any shares of the common stock or other voting securities of the issuer except (i) to wholly- owned subsidiaries of the filing persons, (ii) with the prior written consent of the independent directors (as therein defined) of the issuer, (iii) pursuant to a tender or exchange offer recommended to the shareholders by the independent directors, (iv) in a transaction involving no more than 2% of the voting power of the issuer, (v) in a bona fide, widely distributed, underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement permitted by the registration rights agreement, (vi) into a tender or exchange offer not approved by the issuer's board of directors, pursuant to which, if consummated, the offeror would beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power, (viii) pursuant to a merger or consolidation in which the issuer is acquired, or sale of all or substantially all of the issuer's assets to another corporation or any other transaction approved by the issuer's board of directors, or (viii) to other persons, provided that the issuer shall have a right of first offer to purchase such securities. any proposed sale or other disposition of voting securities pursuant to clause (ii) or (vi) above is subject to the issuer's right to purchase such securities pursuant to the right of first refusal set forth in the investor agreement. the investor agreement provides that filing persons shall vote all voting securities directly or indirectly owned by them in the manner recommended to shareholders by the issuer's board of directors in connection with the election of directors of the issuer. the investor agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur

(b) notwithstanding the provisions of section 3(a), if the company shall furnish to the holders requesting to include registrable securities in the registration a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the company, it would be detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such registration statement to be filed or to become effective and it is therefore beneficial to defer the filing or effectiveness of such registration statement, the company shall have the right to defer such filing or effectiveness for a period of not more than 90 days. the company shall promptly give notice to the holder at the end of any delay period under this section 3(b). (c) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 3, if at the time of any request by a holder for a demand registration, the company has plans to file within 90 days after such request for the sale of any of its securities in a public offering under the securities act, no demand registration shall be initiated under this section 3 until 90 days after the effective date of such registration unless the company is no longer using its reasonable best efforts to effect such registration; provided, however, that the company shall provide the holders of registrable securities the right to participate in such public offering pursuant to, and subject to, the provisions of section 2 hereof, if applicable. 4. holdback agreements; requirements of holders.

(b) cooperation by holders. the offering of registrable securities by holders shall comply in all respects with the applicable terms, provisions and requirements set forth in this agreement, and each holder shall timely provide the company with all information and materials required to be included in a registration statement that relate to such holder, and to take all such action as may be reasonably required in order not to delay the registration and offering of the securities by the company. the company shall have no obligation to include in such registration statement shares of a holder if such holder has failed to furnish such information which, in the opinion of counsel to the company, is required in order for the registration statement to be in compliance with the securities act. 5. registration procedures. whenever any registrable securities are to be registered pursuant to section 2 (including the company's rights under section 2(c)) or 3 of this agreement, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities as contemplated by such section. in connection with any piggy-back registration or demand registration, the company will, subject to section 2 or 3 hereof (as applicable): (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement which includes the registrable securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective;

and comply with the provisions of the securities act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during the applicable period; (c) furnish to the holders of registrable securities included in such registration statement and the underwriter or underwriters thereof, if any, without charge, such number of conformed copies of the registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto and such number of copies of the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendments or supplements thereto, and any documents incorporated by reference therein, as holders or underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities being sold by holders (it being understood that the company consents to the use of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by holders of registrable securities covered by the registration statement and the underwriter or underwriters thereof, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the registrable securities covered by the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto);

(b) indemnification by holder. the holder whose registrable securities are included in any registration statement hereunder will and hereby does indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person who controls the company (within the meaning of the securities act) (collectively, the "company indemnitees") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel and any amounts paid in settlement effected with holder's consent) to which any company indemnitee may become subject under the securities act, at common law or otherwise insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions, suits, investigations or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) are caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement in which holder's registrable securities were included or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary, final or summary prospectus, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have filed with the commission any amendment thereof or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, in the cases described in clauses (i) and (ii), that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by that holder for use in the preparation thereof and (iii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, the fact that holder (or any underwriter therefor) sold registrable securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) if (a) the company has previously furnished copies thereof in compliance with section 5 of this agreement and (b) the loss, claim, damage, liability or expense of such company indemnitee results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the prospectus (or the prospectus as amended or supplemented). such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company (except as provided above) or any of the prospective sellers or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners or controlling persons and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. (c) conduct of indemnification proceeding. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under section 7(a) or 7(b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this section 7, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereto is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the threat or commencement thereof, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation referred to under section 7(a) or 7(b) shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the threat or commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 7 for any legal expenses of counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. each indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent it and assume its defense (in which case the indemnifying party shall not represent it) if, upon the advice of counsel, the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them and in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party. the indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any amounts paid in settlement of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation entered into without the written consent of the indemnifying party. no indemnifying party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the consent of the indemnified party, unless (i) such judgment or settlement does not impose any obligation or liability upon the indemnified party other than the execution, delivery or approval thereof, and (ii) such judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim for all persons that may be entitled to or obligated to provide indemnification or contribution under this section 7. (d) additional indemnification. indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subsections of this section 7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each seller of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any state securities or blue sky laws. (e) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions, suits, investigations or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to in section 7(a) or 7(b) (as applicable) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or inactions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnifying party, any action or inaction by any such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission, action or inaction. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions, suits, investigations or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this section 7(e) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (which shall be limited as provided in section 7(c) if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim in accordance with the provisions thereof) that is the subject of this section 7(e). no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7(e) of written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing with respect to which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 7(e), such indemnified party shall, if a claim for contribution in respect thereto is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof (if the notice specified in section 7(c) has not been given with respect to such action); but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any obligation to provide contribution that it may have to any indemnified party under this section 7(e) except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give notice. notwithstanding anything in this section 7(e) to the contrary, no indemnifying party shall be required pursuant to this section 7(e) to contribute any amount that exceeds the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the sale of registrable securities and other securities of the company (after deducting any underwriting commissions, discounts and transfer taxes applicable thereto) in the offering to which the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of the indemnified parties relate exceeds the amount of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay as indemnity or contribution hereunder by reason of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. if indemnification is available under this section 7, the indemnifying partes shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in sections 7(a) and (b) without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 7(e). the provisions of this section 7(e) shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities by any such party. (f) indemnification and contribution of underwriters. in connection with any underwritten offering contemplated by this agreement that includes registrable securities, the company and all sellers of registrable securities included in any registration statement will agree to customary provisions for indemnification and contribution (consistent with the other provisions of this section 7, except as may be otherwise agreed in writing by the company and such sellers) in respect of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the underwriters of such offering. 8. participation in underwritten registrations. holders may not participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such holder (a) agrees to sell holder's securities on the terms of and on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the company and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 9. rule 144. the company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the commission thereunder from time to time in order to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 11. miscellaneous. (a) recapitalizations, exchanges, etc. the provisions of this agreement shall apply, to the full extent set forth herein with respect to the registrable securities, to any and all shares of equity capital or other securities of the company or any successor or assign of the company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) that may be issued in respect of, in exchange for, or in substitution of the registrable securities, in each case as the amounts of such securities outstanding are appropriately adjusted for any equity dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date of this agreement.

(subject to extension to comply with applicable securities and other applicable laws and regulations related to the transfer of the offered securities from the investor to the purchasers). if the
