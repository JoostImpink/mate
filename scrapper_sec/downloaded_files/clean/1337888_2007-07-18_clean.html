co-sale to the reporting person. page 5 of 8 pages the rights agreement grants the reporting person the right to designate one nominee for election to medsolutions' board of directors, or two nominees in the event that mr. joseph tate, the owner of the reporting person, is designated as a nominee by the reporting person. the reporting person has designated one nominee pursuant to the rights agreement who currently serves as a director of medsolutions. medsolutions' board of directors considers from time to time acquisition candidates to further expand medsolutions' business. pursuant to the terms of the rights agreement, medsolutions may not, prior to the registration of the common stock owned by the reporting person with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), increase the size of its board of directors to more than five members unless the reporting person also designates mr. joseph p. tate as a nominee, in which event the board of directors may have no more than seven members. certain shareholders of medsolutions who are party to the rights agreement have agreed to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the election of the investor's nominee(s). the reporting person's right to designate nominees to medsolutions' board of directors continues until such time as: (i) the reporting person effectuates, in one or a series of transactions, a transfer of shares of common stock whereby the number of shares of common stock owned by the reporting person after such transfer is less than 75% of the number of shares of common stock owned by the reporting person before the transfer, at which such time the reporting person's right to designate nominees to medsolutions' board of directors will be reduced to the right to designate one nominee to medsolutions' board of directors; (ii) the reporting person effectuates, in one or a series of transactions, a transfer of shares of common stock whereby the number of shares of common stock owned by the reporting person after the transfer is less than 50% of the number of shares of common stock owned by the reporting person prior to the transfer, at which such time the reporting person's right to designate nominees to medsolutions' board of directors will terminate; or (iii) the common stock owned by the reporting person has been registered with the sec. pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement, medsolutions is prohibited from paying any dividend on any of medsolutions' equity securities or making any distribution to any of medsolutions' shareholders, whether in cash or in-kind, until the date the common stock owned by the reporting person is registered with the sec; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the 10% dividend payable on medsolutions' series a preferred stock. the investment agreement also provides that medsolutions is prohibited from selling all or a substantial portion of its or its subsidiaries' assets or merging or entering into any combination or consolidation with another person or entity in which medsolutions is not the surviving entity, until the later of the date medsolutions has satisfied all of its obligations

entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") with stericycle, inc. ("stericycle") and tmw acquisition corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of stericycle ("merger sub"). pursuant to the merger agreement, merger sub will be merged with and into medsolutions, with medsolutions continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation. at the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of medsolutions will be converted into the right to receive $0.50 in cash and a promissory note issued by stericycle (a "note") in the principal amount of $1.50. the notes will be payable in six installments of interest only due on each of the first six anniversaries of the date on which the merger closes and one final installment of principal and interest due on the seventh anniversary of such closing date, and will bear interest, at the election of each holder of shares of medsolutions common stock, at the annual rate of either 3.5% (if such shareholder elects to have such note supported by a master letter of credit) or 4.5% (if such shareholder does not elect such support). the principal amount of page 6 of 8 pages the notes, and payments under the notes, are subject to reduction in certain circumstances as provided in the merger agreement. at the effective time of the merger, merger sub's directors and officers immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will become the directors and officers of the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation's articles of incorporation shall be amended and restated to read as the certificate of formation of merger sub read immediately prior to the effective time (with the exception that the name of the surviving corporation shall remain unchanged), and the surviving corporation's bylaws shall be amended and restated to read as the bylaws of merger sub read immediately prior to the effective time (with the exception that the name of the surviving corporation shall remain unchanged). immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase medsolutions common stock, whether or not previously vested, will be cancelled, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of medsolutions common stock issuable upon the exercise of the option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share payable under the option, subject to any required withholding taxes. the amount payable shall consist of 25% cash and 75% in the form of a note, which note shall bear interest at the annual rate of 3.5% or 4.5% (as described above) at the election of the optionholder. the merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007, subject to, among other things, approval of medsolutions' shareholders and other customary closing conditions. the merger has been unanimously approved by the respective boards of directors of medsolutions and stericycle. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the reporting person and certain additional shareholders of medsolutions entered into a voting agreement with stericycle and the merger sub (the "voting agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, such shareholders agreed (i) to vote their shares in favor of the merger; (ii) not to enter into any voting agreement in respect of such shareholders' shares of common stock or give any person a proxy or power of attorney in respect of such shareholders' shares of common stock in conflict with or inconsistent with the such shareholders' obligations under the voting agreement; and (iii) not to transfer their shares except under certain circumstances. an aggregate of 15,102,594 shares of common stock are subject to the voting agreement, which represent 57.1% of the 26,470,646 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of july 6, 2007. the voting agreement will terminate upon any termination of the merger agreement. the foregoing description of the merger agreement and the voting agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement and the voting agreement, which are filed as exhibits 7.01 and 7.02 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated by reference in their entirety into this item 4. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

bankruptcy law. a default under clause (3) is not an event of default until the trustee notifies the company, or the shareholder representative notifies the company and the trustee, of the default and
