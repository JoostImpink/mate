(a) transfers with consent. notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.1, a transfer or disposition of any kind or character otherwise prohibited by this article three may be permitted if approved by the shareholders representatives. (b) transfers to affiliates. notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.1, each of the purchasers shall be permitted to transfer (whether by purchase, assignment, gift, bequest, devise, levy, execution or other means of transfer) all or any portion of the purchased shares to its affiliate (as defined within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") provided that each and every such affiliate executes a written acknowledgment that (i) all purchased shares held by such affiliate will, notwithstanding the transfer to such, be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be owned by the transferring purchaser, and (ii) that such affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms of this agreement. 3.3 transfers to third parties. (a) notice of right of first refusal. notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.1, and absent the right to make a transfer of the purchased shares pursuant to section 3.2, either of the purchasers may also transfer all or a portion of the purchased shares, subject in all respects to the following "right of first refusal" provisions of this section 3.3. if either of the purchasers (the "selling 5 purchaser") desires to sell purchased shares on the market or to a party unrelated to such purchaser in a "non-market" sale, the selling purchaser shall not less than five (5) business days prior to the date of the proposed sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, deliver to the other purchaser and the corporation a "purchaser notice of right of first refusal" containing the following information: (i) the number of shares of purchased shares proposed to be so transferred (the "purchaser offered stock"); (ii) the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including the identity of the proposed transferee(s) and the per share price to be charged (if any) for the purchased shares to be transferred and the cash consideration to be received therefor (the "purchaser offered terms"); and (iii) an affirmative offer made by the selling purchaser to transfer the offered stock to the other purchaser and, after the exclusive option period (as hereinafter defined), to the corporation at a price (the "purchaser offer price") equal to the total cash price in the proposed transfer for the purchaser offered stock as indicated in the purchaser notice of right of first refusal (i.e., the number of shares multiplied by the per share price, if any, to be charged for the shares of stock to be transferred), it being agreed that, (x) without the prior written approval of the other purchaser all transfers permitted by this section 3.3 must be solely for consideration consisting of cash or cash equivalents, and (y) the purchase offer price for all broker's transactions shall be the weighted average sales price for the common stock on the date of delivery of the purchaser notice of right of first refusal. the date that the purchaser notice of right of first refusal is delivered to the purchasers representatives and the corporation shall constitute the purchaser first refusal notice date. (b) primary right of first refusal by the purchasers representatives. the other purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive option to acquire all or any portion of the purchased shares offered by the selling shareholder for transfer in accordance with the provisions of the purchaser notice of right of first refusal for a period of five (5) business days from the purchaser first refusal notice date (the "purchaser exclusive option period"). the other purchaser may exercise such option by giving written notice of exercise to the selling purchaser prior to the termination of its exclusive option period. such notice of exercise shall refer to the purchaser notice of right of first refusal and shall set forth the number of purchased shares to be acquired by the other purchaser. (c) secondary right of first refusal by the corporation. the corporation shall have an exclusive option for two (2) business days after the expiration of the purchaser exclusive option period to acquire all of the offered stock that will not be acquired by the other purchaser. the corporation may assign its purchase rights under this section 3.3 to any or all of the shareholders or to any other current executive officer or director of the company who agrees in writing (in form reasonably acceptable to purchasers) to be subject to and bound by the terms of this agreement). (d) requirement to purchase all offered stock. notwithstanding the provisions of the section 3.3(b), the option to purchase the purchased shares described in a purchaser notice of right of first refusal that describes a proposed non-market transaction may be exercised and the purchaser closing (as hereinafter defined) consummated only if the corporation and/or the other purchaser collectively agree to purchase all of the shares of the purchaser offered stock. (e) closing and tender requirements. the consummation of any transfer required pursuant to an exercise of option rights created by this article three shall constitute the "purchaser closing", and the time and date of such closing shall constitute the "purchaser closing date." the purchase closing shall be held at the principal office of the corporation, at 10:00 a.m. on or before the 25th day subsequent to the expiration of the purchaser exclusive option period and if the closing date falls on a saturday, sunday or legal holiday, the purchase closing date shall be postponed to the next succeeding regular business day following such saturday, sunday or legal holiday. at the purchaser 6 closing, the selling purchaser shall present to the corporation and/or the other purchaser, as the case may be, all share certificates for the purchased shares required to be sold in proper form for transfer. such purchased shares shall be transferred free of all liens and encumbrances or adverse claims of any kind or character. at the purchaser closing, the corporation and/or the other purchaser, as the case may be, upon receipt of proper tender of the purchased shares, shall tender full payment of the purchaser offer price in conformity with the purchaser offered terms as set forth in the purchaser notice of right of first refusal. (f) permitted transfer following right of first refusal. if all of the purchased shares identified in the purchaser notice of right of first refusal are not purchased by the corporation and/or the other purchaser prior to the 25th day subsequent to the expiration of the purchaser exclusive option period, then all of such purchased shares (including any shares for which a proper tender was made) may be transferred by the selling purchaser at any time during the ensuing 30 days (10 days in the case of a market transaction) at any price (in the case of a market transaction) or, in the case of a non-market transaction, in strict conformity with the purchaser offered terms (or on terms more favorable to the selling purchaser) set forth in the purchaser notice of right of first refusal. article
