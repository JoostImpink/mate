(a) as used in this section 11, the term "purchase" means any disposition for value, including without limitation any sale, assignment, transfer, mortgage, pledge or hypothecation for value. to be deemed to be a bona fide offer within the meaning of this section, an offer must be in writing, signed by the offeror (who must be financially capable of carrying out the terms of the offer), and in a form legally enforceable against the offeror. (b) subject to section 11.1(a) hereof, if, at any time or from time to time after the date of this agreement, a common stock holder receives a bona fide offer to purchase all or any part of his common stock, which offer the common stock holder intends to accept, the common stock holder shall promptly give notice to the company and each of the other common stock holders. the notice shall offer the company the right to purchase the common stock which are the subject of the bona fide offer (the "subject shares"), at the same price and on the same terms as set forth in the bona fide offer. the notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the bona fide offer and shall set forth the name and business address of the offeror. if the offeror is a corporation, the notice shall set forth the name and address of the corporation and, unless the proposed disposition will be to secure a bona fide loan to be extended by the offeror in the normal course of its lending business, the names and addresses of all persons owning 10% or more of the capital stock of the corporation. the giving of this notice shall constitute a warranty and representation by the offering common stock holder to the company and the other common stock holders that the offering common stock holder believes the offer to be bona fide in all respects. (c) subject to section 11.1(a), the company shall then have sixty (60) days from the date of the first refusal notice in which to elect to purchase all or a part of the subject shares at the same price and on the same terms as set forth in the bona fide offer. (d) if the company does not elect to purchase all of the subject shares within the 60-day period and the investors have decided not to exercise their rights, if any, pursuant to section 9, the other common stock holders shall then have fifteen (15) days from the end of the 60-day period in which to elect to purchase all or a part of the subject shares which are not purchased by the company or any of the investors (the "leftover shares"). each common stock holder shall have the right to purchase his ratable portion of the leftover shares. if any other common stock holder does not elect to purchase all of his ratable portion of the leftover shares within the 15-day period, then the remaining common stock holders (pro rata among themselves, or in such other proportion as - 43 - 44 they may at such time agree upon) shall have the right, within the 15-day period, to elect to purchase all or part of the leftover shares not elected to be purchased. (e) if the investors, the company and the other common stock holders do not elect, within the specified time periods, to purchase all of the subject shares, then unless a majority of the remaining common stock holders object in writing to such sale, the offering common stock holder may then sell, and the bona fide offeror may purchase, all or part of the subject shares which are not purchased, but only in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the bona fide offer and only if the purchase is fully consummated within one hundred twenty (120) days after the giving of the notice required by section 11.2(b) hereof. the remaining common stock holders' objections shall not be unreasonable. (f) subject to section 11.1(a), if the company or the other common stock holders elect to purchase any subject shares pursuant to this section, closing on the purchase shall be held at a mutually agreeable time within sixty (60) days after the election to purchase is made, at the offices of the company's attorney or such other place as may be mutually agreeable.

(2) the permanent disability of the offering common stock holder.

"permanent disability" means a disability which lasts for more than nine (9) continuous months. (3) the termination of the offering common stock holders' employment with the company voluntarily or for any reason permitted under the terms of the common stock holders' employment agreement with the company. - 44 - 45 (b) a call option shall be deemed to be created immediately upon the occurrence of an option event, and shall expire on the 90th day after the company has written notice of the option event. for purposes of section 9 (investor's first right of refusal), a call option shall constitute an intention by the offering common stockholder to transfer his stock on the terms contained in this section 11.3. subject to section 11.1(a), a call option shall run initially in favor of the company. if the company declines to exercise the call option, or fails to exercise the call option within sixty (60) days from receipt of written notice of the option event, the call option shall run in favor of the other common stock holders (in proportion to their respective ownership of common stock or as they otherwise agree) for the remainder of its period of effectiveness. if the company has declined or failed to exercise its call option and any common stock holder has failed to exercise his or her call option within fifteen days of the date it first becomes exercisable then the remaining common stock holders (pro rata among themselves, or in such other proportion as they may at such time agree upon) shall have the right, within the remaining period of the call option to elect to purchase all or part of the shares subject to the call option as to which the call option has not then been exercised. (c) a call option may be exercised solely by written notice to the offering common stock holder or his or her personal representative delivered by the investors, the company or the other common stock holders, as the case may be. a call option may be exercised only as to all of the offering common stock holder's common stock. (thus, for example, if the investors and the company decline and one of the other common stock holders refuses to exercise the call option and refuses to permit the other common stock holder to purchase his portion, the call option cannot be exercised.) (d) if a call option is exercised, closing on the purchase of the offering common stock holder's common stock shall be conducted not later than sixty (60) days after the exercise at the offices of the company's attorney. the purchase price of the common stock subject to the call option shall be their "fair market value," as defined below, and shall be payable at such closing in cash or bank check.

(f) settlement of any purchase under this section 11.3 shall be held within sixty (60) days of the final determination of fair market value of the common stock subject to the call option. payment for the common stock purchased pursuant to the call option shall be paid as follows: cash at settlement to the extent of twenty-five (25%) percent of the purchase price, with the balance of the purchase price to be paid by a promissory note(s) of the party or parties exercising the option. the principal amount of the note(s) shall: (i) be equal to the balance of the purchase price and the note(s) shall be dated as of the date of settlement; (ii) bear interest, payable quarterly, from the date thereof on the unpaid balance at the prime rate as established by citibank, n.a. or its successor on the date of such note to be adjusted annually on each subsequent anniversary, plus two percent (2%), (but in no event shall the total interest rate exceed ten percent (10%) per annum); (iii) be payable in five (5) equal consecutive annual installments with the first payment due one (1) year after the date of settlement; and (iv) give the maker the right to prepay the principal thereof in whole or in part at the time without penalty.
