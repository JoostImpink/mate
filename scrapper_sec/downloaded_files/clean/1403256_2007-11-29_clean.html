provided, further, that, for purposes of determining the value of class b&#160;units, the aggregate value of one class b&#160;unit in each of the&#160;och-ziff operating group entities shall be deemed to equal the fair market value of a class a share on the date of such contribution, which shall be (i) the closing price of a class a share on the new york stock exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the date of such contribution, or (ii) if the board of directors determines otherwise, another value reasonably determined by the board of directors. &#160; (g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;except as provided in section 2.9(f), (i) the company shall not (w) effect a split or subdivision of its class a shares or&#160;class b shares, (x) effect a reverse share split or combination of its class a shares or class b shares, (y) make a pro rata distribution of its class a shares or class b shares to the respective holders of such class of shares, or (z) effect any other recapitalization or reclassification of its class a shares or class b shares, and (ii) the company shall not permit any och-ziff operating group entity to (w) effect a split or subdivision of its class a units or&#160;class b units, (x) effect a reverse share split or combination of its class a units or class b units, (y) make a pro rata distribution of its class a units or class b units to the respective holders of such class of units, or (z) effect any other recapitalization or reclassification of its class a units or class b units, unless, in each case, similar transactions are effected concurrently with respect to both the class a shares and class b shares of the company, and the class a units and class b units of each och-ziff operating group entity such that, after giving effect to such transactions, (1) the ratio of outstanding class a shares to outstanding class b shares is maintained, (2) the ratio of outstanding class a units to outstanding class b units&#160;is maintained&#160;for each och-ziff operating group entity and (3) the company has the same number 18 of class a shares outstanding as each och-ziff operating group entity has class b units outstanding. &#160;

(vi) the terms and conditions upon which such shares will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the percentage interest, if any,&#160;applicable to such shares; (viii) the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of such shares; (ix) whether there will be restrictions on the issuance of&#160;&#160;shares of the same class or series or any other class or series; and (x) the right, if any, of the holder of each such share to vote on company matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such shares.&#160;&#160;a share designation (or any resolution of the board of directors amending any share designation) shall be effective when a duly executed original of the same is delivered to the secretary of the company for inclusion among the permanent records of the company, and shall be annexed to, and constitute part of, this agreement.&#160;&#160;unless otherwise provided in the applicable share designation, the board of directors may at any time increase or decrease the amount of preferred shares of any class or series, but not below the number of preferred shares of such class or series then outstanding. &#160;

section 3.3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; certificates . &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the board of directors shall determine otherwise in respect of one or more classes of shares or as may be 22 required by the depository with respect to any specific class of shares, shares shall not be evidenced by physical certificates.&#160;&#160;no member shall have the right to require the company to issue physical certificates representing shares for any reason, except as may be required by applicable law.&#160;if the board of directors authorizes the issuance of shares to any person in the form of physical certificates, the company shall issue one or more certificates in the name of such person evidencing the number of such shares being so issued.&#160;&#160;certificates shall be executed on behalf of the company by any two authorized signatories.&#160;&#160;if and to the extent a transfer agent has been appointed with respect to any class or series of shares, no certificate representing such class or series of shares shall be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by the transfer agent; provided, however, that if the board of directors elects to issue shares in global form, the certificates representing shares shall be valid upon receipt of a certificate from the transfer agent certifying that the shares have been duly registered in accordance with the directions of the company.&#160;&#160;any or all&#160;of the signatures required on the certificate may be by facsimile.&#160;&#160;if any officer or transfer agent who shall have signed or whose facsimile signature shall have been placed upon any such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer or transfer agent&#160;before such certificate is issued by the company, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the company with the same effect as if such person were such officer or transfer agent at the date of issue.&#160;&#160;certificates for any class or series of shares shall be consecutively numbered and shall be entered on the books and records of the company as they are issued and shall exhibit the holder's name and number and type of shares. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if any mutilated certificate is surrendered to the company or the transfer agent, the appropriate officers on behalf of the company shall execute, and&#160;the transfer agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new certificate evidencing the same number and class or series of shares as the certificate so surrendered.&#160;&#160;the appropriate officers on behalf of the company shall execute, and the transfer agent shall countersign and deliver, a new certificate in place of any certificate previously issued if the record holder of the certificate: (i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the company, that a previously issued certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen; (ii) requests the issuance of a new certificate before the company has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim; (iii) if requested by the company, delivers to the company a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the company, with surety or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the company may direct to indemnify the company and the transfer agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the certificate; and (iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the company.&#160;&#160;if a member fails to notify the company within a reasonable time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a certificate, and a transfer of the shares represented by the certificate is registered before the company or the transfer agent receives such notification, the member shall be precluded from making any claim against the company or the transfer agent for such transfer or for a new certificate.&#160;&#160;as a condition to the issuance of any new certificate under this section, the company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the transfer agent) reasonably connected therewith. 23 section 3.4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the board of directors shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of section 4.1(c)(ix)(a) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result 30 from the required allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to section 4.1(c)(ix)(a) among the members in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. &#160;

(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under section 5.19(c), and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any indemnified person may apply to the court of chancery of the state of delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the state of delaware or the state of new york for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under section 5.19(a).&#160;&#160;the basis of a court's decision to provide indemnification shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the indemnified person is proper in the circumstances because such indemnified person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in section 5.19(a).&#160;&#160;neither a contrary determination in the specific case under section 5.19(c) nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the indemnified person seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct.&#160;&#160;notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this section 5.19(d) shall be given to the company promptly upon the filing of such application.&#160;&#160;if successful, in whole or in part, the indemnified person seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application. &#160;

(g)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the company may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person entitled to indemnification under this section 5.19 against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any capacity to which they are entitled to indemnification hereunder, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the company would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this section 5.19. &#160;

(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the company and to the employees and agents of the company group similar to those conferred in this section 5.19 to indemnified persons. &#160; (j)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if this section 5.19 or any portion of this section 5.19 shall be invalidated on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction the company shall nevertheless indemnify each indemnified person&#160;as to expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including a grand jury proceeding or action or suit brought by or in the right of the company, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this section 5.19 that shall not have been invalidated. &#160;

provided that such legal counsel or accountants were selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the company. 42 (l)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;an indemnified person shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this section 5.19 because the indemnified person had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this agreement. &#160; (m)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;any liabilities which an indemnified person incurs as a result of acting on behalf of the company (whether as a fiduciary or otherwise) in connection with the operation, administration or maintenance of an employee benefit plan or any related trust or funding mechanism (whether such liabilities are in the form of excise taxes assessed by the united states internal revenue service, penalties assessed by the department of labor, restitutions to such a plan or trust or other funding mechanism or to a participant or beneficiary of such plan, trust or other funding mechanism, or otherwise) shall be treated as liabilities indemnifiable under this section 5.19, to the maximum extent permitted by law. &#160;

provided, however, that the foregoing will not limit the ability of the board of directors to authorize the company to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the company without the approval of any member. &#160;

notwithstanding the foregoing, an&#160;issuer delay notice to be sent to the ziffs may (but need not) omit certain information described above that the issuer determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, constitutes material non-public information&#160;and no&#160;event that otherwise would constitute a delay event under clause (ii) of the definition of delay event shall constitute a delay event with respect to a special quarterly ziff exchange. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; each party hereto shall bear his own expenses in connection with the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not any such transaction is ultimately consummated. &#160;

section 2.8 &#160;&#160; splits, distributions and reclassifications .&#160;&#160;the exchange rate shall be adjusted accordingly if there is: (1) any subdivision (by split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of the och-ziff operating group units that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the class a shares; or (2) any subdivision (by split, distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification, &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; recapitalization or otherwise) of the class a shares that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the och-ziff operating group units. in the event of a reclassification or other similar transaction as a result of which the class a shares are converted into another security, then an och-ziff limited partner shall be entitled to receive upon exchange the amount of such security that such och-ziff limited partner would have received if such exchange had occurred immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification or other similar transaction. except as may be required in the immediately preceding sentence, no adjustments in respect of distributions shall be made upon an exchange. &#160;

provided further , that the provisions of this section 2.11 shall apply only to the extent that there are an equal number of such excess interests in each och-ziff operating group partnership proposed to be exchanged as part of a single exchange. &#160;

&#160; (v) &#160;&#160; as of the applicable reallocation date, all of the unvested and vested class a common units of such partner and its related trusts, if any, and all allocations and distributions on such class a common units that would otherwise have been received by such partners on or after the date of such breach shall be reallocated from such partners&#160;to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts; &#160; (vi) &#160;&#160; each of such partner and its related trusts, if any, agrees that, on the reallocation date, it shall immediately: &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; pay to the continuing partners, in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts, a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of: (i) the total after-tax proceeds received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof for any class a shares acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and &#160; 23 &#160; that were subsequently transferred during the 24-month period prior to the date of such breach; and (ii) any distributions received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof during such 24-month period on class a shares acquired pursuant to the exchange agreement; &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; transfer any class a shares that were acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and held by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof on and after the date of such breach to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts; and &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; pay to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of: (i) the total after-tax proceeds received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof for any class a shares acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and that were subsequently transferred on or after the date of such breach; and (ii) all distributions received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof on or after the date of such breach on class a shares acquired pursuant to the exchange agreement; and &#160; (vii) &#160;&#160; such partner and its related trusts agrees that he shall receive no payments, if any, that he would have otherwise received under the tax receivable agreement on or after the date of such breach, and shall have no further rights under the tax receivable agreement, exchange agreement or registration rights agreement after such date. &#160; any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements, if any, in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his breach of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement.&#160;&#160;any continuing partner receiving reallocated class a common units pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be permitted to exchange fifty percent (50%) of such number of class a common units (and sell any class a shares issued in respect thereof), notwithstanding the transfer restrictions set forth in section 8.1 in the event that the exchange committee (as defined in the exchange agreement) determines in its sole discretion that the reallocation is taxable; provided, however, that such exchange of class a common units is made in accordance with the exchange agreement. &#160; (h) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding anything in section 2.13(g) to the contrary, the general partner may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to waive the application of any portion, all or none of the provisions of section 2.13(g) in the case of the breach by any partner of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement. &#160; 24 &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; without limiting the right of the partnership to obtain injunctive relief for any attempted or threatened breach of this section 2.13, in the event a partner breaches section 2.13(c), (d) or (e), then at the election of the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion the partnership shall be entitled to seek any other available remedies including, but not limited to, an award of money damages. &#160; section 2.14 &#160;&#160; insurance .&#160;&#160;the partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, to the extent and in such amounts as the general partner shall deem reasonable, on behalf of covered persons and such other persons as the general partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by any such person in connection with the activities of the partnership and/or its subsidiaries regardless of whether the partnership would have the power or obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this agreement.&#160;&#160;the partnership may enter into indemnity contracts with covered persons and such other persons as the general partner shall determine and adopt written procedures pursuant to which arrangements are made for the advancement of expenses and the funding of obligations under this section 2.14, and containing such other procedures regarding indemnification as are appropriate and consistent with this agreement. &#160;

section 5.2 &#160;&#160; capital accounts . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; the general partner shall maintain, for each partner owning units or class c non-equity interests, a separate capital account with respect to such partner in accordance with the rules of treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).&#160;&#160;such capital account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all capital contributions made to the partnership with respect to any such units or class c non-equity interests pursuant to this agreement and (ii) all items of partnership income and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with section 5.2(b) and allocated with respect to any such units and class c non-equity interests pursuant to section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or net agreed value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to any such units and class c non-equity interests pursuant to this agreement and (y) all items of partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with section 5.2(b) and allocated with respect to any such units pursuant to section 6.1.&#160;&#160;except as otherwise indicated in this agreement, the foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this agreement&#160;relating to the maintenance of capital accounts are intended to comply with treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such treasury regulation. &#160; 35 &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; for purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction, which is to be allocated pursuant to article vi and is to be reflected in the partners' capital accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for u.s. federal income tax purposes (including, without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose); provided, however, that: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; except as otherwise provided in treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under section 754 of the code which may be made by the partnership and, as to those items described in section 705(a)(1)(b) or 705(a)(2)(b) of the code, without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for u.s. federal income tax purposes.&#160;&#160;to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis&#160;of any partnership asset pursuant to section 734(b) or 743(b) of the code is required, pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining capital accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the capital accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the partnership's carrying value with respect to such property as of such date. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; the capital account balance of each partner and the carrying value of all partnership property shall be adjusted in accordance with the rules set forth in treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) to reflect the partner's allocable share (as determined under article iv) of the items of net income or net loss that would be realized by the partnership if it sold all of its property at its fair market value (taking code section 7701(g) into account) on (a) the date of the acquisition of any additional interest in the partnership by any new or existing partner in exchange for more than a de minimis capital contribution; (b) the date of the distribution of more than a de&#160;minimis amount of partnership assets to a partner; (c) the date any interest in the partnership is relinquished to the partnership; or (d) any other date specified in the treasury regulations; provided, however, that adjustments pursuant to clauses (a), (b) (c) and (d) above shall be made only if the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the partners. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; a transferee of units shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the capital account of the transferor relating to the units so transferred, unless otherwise determined by the general partner. &#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial general partner shall not succeed to any portion of any of the investment capital accounts of the holders of class a common units that are purchased by the partnership with the proceeds received from the ipo and the dic sahir transaction. &#160; 36 &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in this agreement, no partner shall have the right to request, demand, or receive any distribution in respect of such partner's capital account from the partnership (other than as expressly provided in article vii or article ix). &#160; section 5.3 &#160;&#160; investment capital accounts .&#160;&#160;until the date on which the investment distributions occur, the general partner shall maintain the separate investment capital accounts of the original partners, adjusted to take into account items of fund net profits and fund net losses allocated to such partners under article vi, in accordance with the principles of the original partnership agreement. &#160; section 5.4 &#160;&#160; determinations by general partner .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in this agreement, in the event the general partner shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the capital accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to effectuate the intended economic sharing arrangement of the partners, the general partner may make such modification. &#160; &#160; article vi &#160; allocations &#160; section 6.1 &#160;&#160; allocations for capital account purposes .&#160;&#160;for purposes of maintaining the capital accounts and in determining the rights of the partners among themselves, the partnership's items of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with section 5.2(b)) shall be allocated among the partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided herein below. &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; net income .&#160;&#160;subject to the terms of any unit designation, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in section 6.1(d), net income for each taxable year and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing net income for such taxable year shall be allocated to the partners: first, with respect to partners that have class c non-equity interests, in amounts, if any, as determined by class c approval in respect of each such partner for such taxable year and, second, in accordance with the respective percentage interests of the partners. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; net loss .&#160;&#160;subject to the terms of any unit designation, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in section 6.1(d), net loss for each taxable period and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing net loss for such taxable period shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests; provided, however, that to the extent any allocation of net loss would cause any partner to have a deficit balance in its adjusted capital account at the end of such taxable year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its adjusted capital account), such allocation of net loss shall be reallocated among the other partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests. &#160; 37 &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; fund net profits and fund net losses .&#160;&#160;items of fund net profits and fund net losses shall be allocated to the original partners in accordance with their investment percentages consistent with the principles of the original partnership agreement. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; special allocations .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; partnership minimum gain chargeback .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, each partner shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(d), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(d)(iii) and 6.1(d)(vi)).&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the partnership minimum gain chargeback requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 6.1 (other than section 6.1(d)(i)), except as provided in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, any partner with a share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(d), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section 6.1(d), other than section 6.1(d)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(d)(v) and 6.1(d)(vi), with respect to such taxable period.&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; qualified income offset .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in treasury regulation sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), items of partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the deficit balance, if any, in its adjusted capital account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to section 6.1(d)(i) or (ii).&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(iii) is intended to qualify and be construed as a "qualified income offset" within &#160; 38 &#160; the meaning of treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iv) &#160;&#160; gross income allocations .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner has a deficit balance in its capital account at the end of any partnership taxable period in excess of the sum of (a) the amount such partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this agreement and (b) the amount such&#160;partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such partner shall be specially allocated items of partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such partner would have a deficit balance in its capital account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 6.1(d)(iv) were not in this agreement. &#160; (v) &#160;&#160; nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests.&#160;&#160;if the general partner determines that the partnership's nonrecourse deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the general partner is authorized, upon notice to the other partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements. &#160; (vi) &#160;&#160; partner nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;partner nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the partner that bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i).&#160;&#160;if more than one partner bears the economic risk of loss with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt, such partner nonrecourse deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such economic risk of loss. &#160; (vii) &#160;&#160; nonrecourse liabilities .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse liabilities of the partnership described in treasury regulation section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated among the partners in the manner chosen by the general partner and consistent with such treasury regulation. &#160; (viii) &#160;&#160; code section 75 4 adjustments .&#160;&#160;to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any partnership asset pursuant to section 734(b) or 743(b) of the code is required, pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining capital accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the capital accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their capital accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the treasury regulations. &#160; 39 &#160; (ix) &#160;&#160; curative allocation .&#160;&#160;the required allocations are intended to comply with certain requirements of the treasury regulations.&#160;&#160;it is the intent of the partners that, to the extent possible, all required allocations shall be offset either with other required allocations or with special allocations of other items of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this section 6.1(d)(ix).&#160;&#160;therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this article vi (other than the required allocations), the general partner shall make such offsetting special allocations of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each partner's capital account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the capital account balance such partner would&#160;have had if the required allocations were not part of this agreement and all partnership items were allocated pursuant to the economic agreement among the partners. &#160; (x) &#160;&#160; the general partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of section 6.1(d)(ix) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the required allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to section 6.1(d)(ix) among the partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. &#160; (xi) &#160;&#160; the partnership shall specially allocate an amount of gross income equal to the expense amount to the general partner. &#160; section 6.2 &#160;&#160; allocations for tax purposes . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; except as otherwise provided herein, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; in an attempt to eliminate book-tax disparities attributable to a contributed property or an adjusted property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for u.s. federal income tax purposes among the partners as follows: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; (a) in the case of a contributed property, such items attributable thereto shall be allocated among the partners in the manner provided under section 704(c) of the code that takes into account the variation between the agreed value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to a contributed property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; (a) in the case of an adjusted property, such items attributable thereto shall (1) first, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with the principles of section 704(c) of the code to take into account the book-tax disparity of such property, and (2) second, in the event such property was originally a contributed property, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with section &#160; 40 &#160; 6.2(b)(i)(a); and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to an adjusted property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; the general partner may cause the partnership to eliminate book-tax disparities using any method or methods described in treasury regulation section 1.704-3 or that it determines is appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; for the proper administration of the partnership, the general partner, as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion&#160;is necessary or appropriate to execute the provisions of this agreement and to comply with u.s. federal, state and local tax law, may (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including, without limitation, gross income) or deductions; (iii) amend the provisions of this agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of treasury regulations under section 704(b) or section 704(c) of the code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the units (or any class or classes thereof); and (iv) adopt and employ methods for (a) the maintenance of capital accounts for book and tax purposes, (b) the determination and allocation of adjustments under sections 704(c), 734 and 743 of the code, (c) the determination and allocation of taxable income, tax loss and items thereof under this agreement and pursuant to the code, (d) the determination of the identities and tax classification of holders of units, (e) the provision of tax information and reports to the holders of units, (f) the adoption of reasonable conventions and methods for the valuation of assets and the determination of tax basis, (g) the allocation of asset values and tax basis, (h) the adoption and maintenance of accounting methods, (i) the recognition of the transfer of units and (j) tax compliance and other tax-related requirements, including without limitation, the use of computer software. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes and allocated to the partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under section 754 of the code that may be made by the partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by sections 734 and 743 of the code. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; for purposes of determining the items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit allocable to any partner with respect to any period, such items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, quarterly or other basis, as determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion using any permissible method under code section 706 and the regulations thereunder. &#160; 41 &#160; article vii &#160; distributions &#160; section 7.1 &#160;&#160; distributions . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; no partner shall have the right to withdraw capital or demand or receive distributions or other returns of any amount in his capital account, except as expressly provided in this article vii or article ix. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; subject to the terms of any unit designation, distributions in respect of units shall be made to the partners in the following order: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; first, tax distributions shall be made pursuant to section 7.3; &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; second, an expense amount distribution&#160;shall be made pursuant to section 7.4. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; third, distributions, if any, shall be made to the relevant limited partners in respect of class c non-equity interests as and when determined by class c approval. &#160; (iv) &#160;&#160; fourth, distributions shall be made as and when determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion in accordance with the partners' respective percentage interests. &#160; (v) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the investment distributions shall be made to the applicable original partners in accordance with their investment capital accounts and (b) in the event of a sale or dissolution of the partnership, all distributions shall be made in accordance with section 9.4. &#160; section 7.2 &#160;&#160; distributions in kind .&#160;&#160;the general partner may cause the partnership to make distributions of assets in kind in its sole and absolute discretion.&#160;&#160;whenever the distributions provided for in section 7.1 shall be distributable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property determined by the general partner in good faith, and in the event of such a distribution&#160;there shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with article vi the amount of net income or net loss that would result if the distributed asset had been sold for an amount in cash equal to its fair market value at the time of the distribution.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, net income or net loss that would result if any asset distributed to a partner as part of the investment distributions had been sold for cash equal to its fair market value at the time of the investment distributions shall be allocated pursuant to the foregoing sentence solely to the original partners receiving the distribution of such asset.&#160;&#160;no partner shall have the right to demand that the partnership distribute any assets in kind to such partner. &#160; section 7.3 &#160;&#160; tax distributions .&#160;&#160;subject to &#167;17-607 of the act, and unless determined otherwise by the general partner in its sole discretion, the partnership shall make &#160; 42 &#160; distributions to each partner for each calendar quarter ending after the date hereof as follows (collectively, the " tax distribu tions "): &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the first quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the first quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the second quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the second quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the third quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the third quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the fourth quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the fourth quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; and &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; tax distributions shall be made on the basis of a calendar year regardless of the fiscal year used by the partnership.&#160;&#160;to the extent the general partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion that the distributions made under the foregoing subsections (a) through (d) are insufficient to satisfy the partners' presumed tax liability for the applicable calendar year, on or before the april 10th immediately following the applicable calendar year, an amount that the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion will be sufficient to allow each partner to satisfy his presumed tax liability for the applicable calendar year, after taking into account all prior distributions made to the partners with respect to the applicable calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, other than section 7.3(g), tax distributions shall be made: (i) to all partners pro rata in accordance with their percentage interests; and (ii) as if each distributee partner was allocated an amount of income in each quarterly period in respect of such partner's units equal to the product of (x) the highest amount of income allocated to any partner with respect to his units, calculated on a per-unit basis, taking into account any income allocations pursuant to section 6.2 hereof and disregarding any adjustment required by section 734 or section 743 of the code, multiplied by (y) the amount of units held by such distributee partner. &#160; 43 &#160; (g) &#160;&#160; subject to the limitations set forth in this section 7.3, the partnership shall make distributions in respect of the tax liability of a partner arising from the allocation of any items hereunder to class c non-equity interests applying principles similar to the principles for determining tax distributions and presumed tax liability, and amounts so allocated, determined or distributed with respect to class c non-equity interests of a partner shall not be taken into account in determining any tax distributions in respect of units. &#160; section 7.4 &#160;&#160; expense amount distributions.&#160;&#160;the partnership shall distribute any expense amount to the general partner at such times as the general partner shall determine in its sole discretion&#160;(an "expense amount distribution"). &#160; section 7.5 &#160;&#160; borrowing .&#160;&#160;subject to section 17-607 of the act, the partnership may borrow funds in order to make the tax distributions&#160;or expense amount distributions. &#160; section 7.6 &#160;&#160; restrictions on distributions .&#160;&#160;the foregoing provisions of this article vii to the contrary notwithstanding, no distribution shall be made: (a) if such distribution would violate any contract or agreement to which the partnership is then a party or any law, rule, regulation, order or directive of any governmental authority then applicable to the partnership; (b) to the extent that the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any amount otherwise distributable should be retained by the partnership to pay, or to establish a reserve for the payment of, any liability or obligation of the partnership, whether liquidated, fixed, contingent or otherwise; or&#160;(c) to the extent that the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that the cash available to the partnership is insufficient to permit such distribution. &#160; &#160; article viii &#160; transfer or assignment of interest; cessation of partner status &#160; section 8.1 &#160;&#160; transfer a nd assignment of interest . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; oz limited partners .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, transfers of class a common units may only be made by oz limited partners (x) in accordance with the other provisions of this article viii (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions in section 8.4, except as expressly set forth in this section 8.1(a) in respect of transfers by original related trusts), and (y) subject to section 2.13(g).&#160;&#160;during the restricted period, no oz limited partner shall be permitted to transfer class a common units unless, following the date of such transfer, the relevant individual limited partner and its related trusts continue to hold in the aggregate at least 25% of the class a common units of such partners that have vested on or before the date of such transfer, without regard to dispositions (such requirements, the " minimum retained ownership requirements ").&#160;&#160;an oz limited partner may not transfer all or any of such partner's units without the prior written approval of the general partner, which approval may be granted or withheld, with or without reason, in the general partner's sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that, without the prior written approval of the general partner, (i) an original related trust may transfer its interest (including any unvested units) in accordance with its related trust supplementary agreement to the &#160; 44 &#160; relevant subsequent related trust (provided, however, that such subsequent related trust remains subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring original related trust had been before its withdrawal), (ii)&#160;the related trust of any individual limited partner may, at any time, subject to section 2.13(g), transfer such related trust's class a common units (including any unvested units) to such individual limited partner as authorized by the terms of the relevant trust agreement&#160;(provided, however, that such individual limited partner remains subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring related trust had been before the transfer), and (iii) any oz limited partner may, at any time, subject to the minimum retained ownership requirements and section 2.13(g), and provided further that the relevant units have vested in accordance with section 8.4, (a) transfer any of such partner's units in accordance with the exchange agreement, (b) transfer any of such partner's units to a permitted transferee of such partner with pmc approval, which pmc approval may not be unreasonably withheld, (c) transfer the &#160; class a common units (including all distributions thereon that would otherwise be received after the relevant date of withdrawal) received by such partner pursuant to sections 2.13(g) and 8.3(a) to the extent permitted thereby, (d) transfer by operation of law upon the death of an individual limited partner or (e) transfer any of such partner's units to the extent permitted or required by section 8.5 or 8.6.&#160;&#160;in addition, subject to section 2.13(g) and the minimum retained ownership requirements, with prior pmc approval, each oz limited partner and such oz limited partner's permitted transferees may transfer units that have vested in accordance with applicable securities laws.&#160;&#160;the foregoing restrictions on transfer and the minimum retained ownership requirements may be waived at any time with pmc approval.&#160;&#160;a limited partner shall cease to be a partner if, following a transfer, he no longer has any interest in the partnership.&#160;&#160;an original related trust shall cease to be a partner, without the prior written consent of the general partner, following the transfer of such original related trust's interest in accordance with its related trust supplementary agreement to the relevant subsequent related trust. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; the ziff p artner .&#160;&#160;provided that the relevant units have vested in accordance with section 8.4, the ziff partner may (i) transfer any of such partner's units in accordance with the exchange agreement, (ii) transfer class a common units to public charities with pmc approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (iii) transfer any of such partner's units to the extent permitted by section 8.5.&#160;&#160;the foregoing restrictions on transfer may be waived at any time with pmc approval.&#160;&#160;in the event that a transfer of the ziff partner's units is made, directly or indirectly, in accordance with this section 8.1(b) to a natural person, the units of such natural person may be transferred upon his death by operation of law. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; transfer and exchange .&#160;&#160;when a request to register a transfer of units, together with the relevant certificates of ownership, if any, is presented to the transfer agent, the transfer agent shall register the transfer or make the exchange on the register or transfer books of the transfer agent if the requirements set forth in this section 8.1 for such transactions are met; provided, however, that any certificates of ownership presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the transfer agent duly executed by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.&#160;&#160;the transfer agent shall not be required to register a transfer of any units or exchange any certificate of ownership if such &#160; 45 &#160; purported transfer would cause the partnership to violate the securities act, the exchange act, the investment company act (including by causing any violation of the laws, rules, regulations, orders and other directives of any governmental authority) or otherwise violate this section 8.1.&#160;&#160;in the event of any transfer, the transferring partner shall provide the address and facsimile number for each transferee as contemplated by section 10.10 and shall cause each transferee to agree in writing to comply with the terms of this agreement. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; publicly traded partnership .&#160;&#160;no transfer shall be permitted (and, if attempted, shall be void ab initio) if the general partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion that such a transfer would pose a risk that the partnership would be a "publicly traded partnership" as defined in section 7704 of the code. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; securities laws .&#160;&#160;each partner and each assignee thereof hereby agrees that it will not effect any transfer of all or any part of its interest in the partnership (whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law) in any manner contrary to the terms of this agreement or that violates or causes the partnership or the partners to violate the securities act, the exchange act, the investment company act,&#160;or the laws, rules, regulations, orders and other directives of any governmental authority. &#160; section 8.2 &#160;&#160; withdrawal by general partner .&#160;&#160;the general partner shall not cease to act as the general partner of the partnership without the prior written approval of the limited partners holding a majority of the outstanding class b common units. &#160;

(b) for any reason or no reason upon a determination by majority vote of the partner performance committee (which, if the partner performance committee has a chairman, may only be made upon the recommendation of such chairman) and notice of such determination to the individual limited partner from the partner performance committee; or (c) upon the individual limited partner otherwise (except as a result of death, disability or a special withdrawal) ceasing to be, or providing notice to the general partner of his intention to cease to be, actively involved with the partnership and its affiliates.&#160;&#160;in the event of the withdrawal of an individual limited partner, such individual limited partner's related trusts, if any, shall be subject to a required withdrawal. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; in the event of the withdrawal of an individual original partner prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date (other than where the withdrawal is due to a breach of any of the non-competition covenants in section 2.13(b), in which case the provisions of section 2.13(g) shall apply), all of the class a common units (including all distributions thereon that would otherwise be received after the date of withdrawal) of &#160; 46 &#160; such individual original partner and its related trusts, if any, that have not yet vested in accordance with section 8.4 shall cease to vest with respect to such partners and upon the reallocation date shall be reallocated to each continuing partner in such a manner that each such continuing partner receives class a common units in proportion to the total number of original class a common units of such continuing partner and its original related trusts.&#160;&#160;any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 8.3(a) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his withdrawal; provided, however, that such continuing partner shall be permitted to exchange fifty percent (50%) of such number of class a common units (and sell any class a shares issued in respect thereof), notwithstanding the transfer restrictions set forth in section 8.1 in the event that the exchange committee (as defined in the exchange agreement) determines in its sole discretion that the reallocation is taxable; provided, however, that such exchange of class a common units is made in accordance with the exchange agreement. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(b) &#160;&#160; special withdraw al . &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; an individual limited partner (other than daniel s. och) may be required to no longer be actively involved with the partnership and its affiliates for any reason other than cause, in the sole and absolute discretion of the general partner&#160;(such event, a " special withdrawal "), which shall not constitute a withdrawal.&#160;&#160;upon the special withdrawal of an individual limited partner, such individual limited partner's related trusts, if any, shall also be subject to a special withdrawal. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; in the event of the special withdrawal of any limited partner, such limited partner's class a common units shall continue to vest in accordance with section 8.4. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; upon a withdrawal or special withdrawal, an individual limited partner shall: (i) have no right to access or use the property of the partnership or its affiliates, and (ii) not be permitted to provide services to, or on behalf of, the partnership or its affiliates. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; the provisions of sections 8.3(a) and 8.3(b) may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived with pmc approval. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; except as expressly provided in this agreement, no event affecting a partner, including death, bankruptcy, insolvency or withdrawal from the partnership, shall affect the partnership. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; following the withdrawal of an oz limited partner, from the applicable reallocation date such limited partner will be required to pay the same management fees and shall be subject to the same incentive allocation with respect to any remaining investments by such limited partner in any fund or account managed by och-ziff or any of its subsidiaries as are applicable to other investors that are not affiliates of och-ziff in such funds or accounts. &#160; 47 &#160; section 8.4 &#160;&#160; vesting . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; all class a common units purchased, indirectly, with proceeds from the ipo (including proceeds from any exercise of the underwriter option) and the dic sahir transaction&#160;will be deemed to have fully vested on issuance and such purchase (and will be immediately cancelled after such purchase). &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; subject to sections 2.13(g) and 8.3(a), all original class a common units held by a partner shall vest in equal installments on each anniversary date of the closing date for five years, beginning on the first anniversary date of the closing date; provided, however, that upon a withdrawal (but not a special withdrawal), all unvested units shall cease to vest and shall be reallocated pursuant to section 8.3(a); and provided, however, that this section 8.4(b) shall not prevent the transfer of the unvested interest of any original related trust (including unvested class a common units) in accordance with its related trust supplementary agreement to the relevant subsequent related trust or the transfer of unvested class a common units of an individual limited partner's related trust to such individual limited partner as authorized by the terms of the relevant trust agreement.&#160;&#160;in the event of the death or disability of an individual limited partner or in the event of a transfer of any of such individual limited partner's class a common units, such class a common units shall continue to vest on the same schedule as set forth above.&#160;&#160;these vesting requirements may be waived at any time with pmc approval. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; all class b common units will be fully vested on issuance. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; all class c non-equity interests held by a limited partner shall be cancelled upon the death, disability, withdrawal or special withdrawal of such limited partner. &#160;

(b) &#160;&#160; prior to the consummation of a tag-along sale, the oz limited partners participating in such tag-along sale (the " tag-along sellers ") shall cause the tag-along purchaser to offer in writing (such offer, a " tag-along offer ") to purchase each potential tag-along seller's tag-along securities.&#160;&#160;in addition, the tag-along offer shall set forth the consideration for which the tag-along sale is proposed to be made and all other material terms and conditions of the tag-along sale.&#160;&#160;if the tag-along offer is accepted by some or all of such potential tag-along sellers within five business days after its receipt then the number of class a shares and/or class a common units to be sold to the tag-along purchaser by the tag-along sellers shall be reduced by the number of class a shares&#160;and/or class a common units to be purchased by the tag-along purchaser from such accepting potential tag-along sellers.&#160;&#160; &#160; 48 &#160; the purchase from the accepting potential tag-along sellers shall be made on the same terms and conditions (including timing of receipt of consideration and choice of consideration, if any) as the tag-along purchaser shall have offered to the tag-along sellers, and the accepting potential tag-along sellers shall otherwise be required to transfer the class a shares and/or class a common units to the tag-along purchaser upon the same terms, conditions, and provisions as the tag-along sellers, including making the same representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements that the tag-along sellers agree to make. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; each oz limited partner acknowledges that, if he participates in a "tag-along sale" (as defined in the dic sahir transaction agreement), dic sahir has certain "tag-along rights" as set forth in the dic sahir transaction agreement and such oz limited partner agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8.5, in the event he does participate in such a "tag-along sale" then he will act in accordance with the provisions in the dic sahir transaction agreement relating to "tag-along rights" as if it were a party thereto. &#160; section 8.6 &#160;&#160; drag-along rights . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; prior to the consummation of a proposed drag-along sale, the drag-along sellers may, at their option, require each other oz limited partner to sell its drag-along securities to the drag-along purchaser by giving written notice (the " notice ") to such other oz limited partners not later than ten business days prior to the consummation of the drag-along sale (the " drag-along right "); provided, however, that if the drag along right is exercised by the drag-along sellers, all oz limited partners shall sell their drag-along securities to the drag-along purchaser on the same terms and conditions, including the class of security, the consideration per company security and the date of sale, as applicable to the drag-along sellers.&#160;&#160;the notice shall contain written notice of the exercise of the drag-along right pursuant to this section 8.6, setting forth the consideration to be paid by the drag-along purchaser and the other material terms and conditions of the drag-along sale. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; within five business days following the date of the notice, the drag-along sellers shall have delivered to them by the other oz limited partners their drag-along securities together with a limited power-of-attorney authorizing such drag-along sellers to sell such other oz limited partner's drag-along securities pursuant to the terms of the drag-along sale and such other transfer instruments and other documents as are reasonably requested by the drag-along sellers in order to effect such sale. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; each oz limited partner agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8.6, it shall participate in a "drag-along sale" (as defined in the dic sahir transaction agreement) in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the provisions in the dic sahir transaction agreement relating to "drag-along rights" as if it were a party thereto. &#160;

except as provided in this agreement, the death, disability, resignation, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of any partner or the occurrence of any other event which terminates the continued participation of any partner in the partnership shall not cause the partnership to be dissolved or its affairs wound up; provided, however, that at any time after the bankruptcy of the general partner, the holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units may, pursuant to prior written consent to such effect, replace the general partner with another person, who shall, after executing a written instrument confirming such person's agreement to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this agreement, (i) become a successor general partner for all purposes hereunder, (ii) be vested with the powers and rights of the replaced general partner, and (iii) be liable for all obligations and responsible for all duties of the replaced general partner from the date of such replacement. &#160; section 9.2 &#160;&#160; notice of liquidation .&#160;&#160;the general partner shall give each of the partners prompt written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the partnership. &#160; section 9.3 &#160;&#160; liquidator .&#160;&#160;upon dissolution of the partnership, the general partner may select one or more persons to act as a liquidating trustee for the partnership (such person, or the general partner, the " liquidator ").&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;upon dissolution, death, incapacity, removal or resignation of the liquidator, a successor and substitute liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by the general partner (or, in the case of the removal of the liquidator by holders of units, by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation)).&#160;&#160;the right to approve a successor or substitute liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute liquidator approved in the manner herein provided.&#160;&#160;except as expressly provided in this section 9.3, the liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the general partner under the terms of this agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers) necessary or appropriate to carry &#160; 50 &#160; out the duties and functions of the liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the partnership as provided for herein. &#160; section 9.4 &#160;&#160; liquidation .&#160;&#160;the liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the liquidator, subject to section 17-804 of the act and the following: &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; subject to section 9.4(d), the assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more partners on such terms as the liquidator and such partner or partners may agree.&#160;&#160;if any property is distributed in kind, except with respect to the investment distributions, the partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of section 9.4(d) to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other partners.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the partners understand and acknowledge that a partner may be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from the partnership despite the fact that the percentage of the asset distributed to such partner exceeds the percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which such partner shares in distributions from the partnership.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the partnership's assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may distribute the partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; liabilities of the partnership include amounts owed to the liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of section 9.3) and amounts to partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under article vii.&#160;&#160;with respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment.&#160;&#160;when paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be applied to other liabilities or distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; subject to the terms of any unit designation and except as otherwise provided in section 6.1 with respect to the investment distributions, all property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in section 9.4(b) shall be distributed to the partners in accordance with and to the extent of the positive balances in their respective capital accounts, as determined after taking into account all capital account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this section 9.4(c)) for the taxable year of the partnership during which the liquidation of the partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined by the general partner) and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence). &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if, upon the dissolution and liquidation of the partnership pursuant to this article ix and after all other allocations provided for in section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 9.4 were not &#160; 51 &#160; in this agreement, either (i) the positive capital account balance attributable to one or more units having a liquidation preference is not equal to such liquidation preference, or (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the positive balance of a partner's capital account with respect to common units by the aggregate of all partners' capital account balances with respect to common units at such time would differ from such partner's percentage interest, then the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may decide that net income (and items thereof) and net loss (and items thereof) for the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and liquidates pursuant to this article ix shall be allocated among the partners (x) first, to the extent necessary to ensure that the capital account balance attributable to a unit having a liquidation preference is equal to such liquidation preference, and (y) second, in a manner such that the positive balance in the capital account of each partner with respect to common units, immediately after giving effect to such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to each such partner's percentage interest.&#160;&#160;the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may apply the principles of this section 9.4(d) to any fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and terminates (including through application of section 761(e) of the code) if delaying application of the principles of this section 9.4(d) would likely result in capital account balances that are materially different from the capital account balances set forth&#160;in clauses (x) and (y) of the preceding sentence. &#160; section 9.5 &#160;&#160; capital account restoration .&#160;&#160;no partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its capital account upon liquidation of the partnership. &#160; &#160; article x &#160; miscellaneous &#160; section 10.1 &#160;&#160; incorporation of agreements .&#160;&#160;the exchange agreement and the tax receivable agreement shall each be treated as part of this agreement as described in section 761(c) of the code and treasury regulation sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c). &#160; section 10.2 &#160;&#160; amendment to the agreement . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; except as may be otherwise required by law, this agreement may be amended by the general partner without the consent or approval of any partners, subject to the rights of the ziff partner in section 10.2(b), provided, however, that, except as expressly provided herein (including, without limitation, sections 3.2, 5.2(d) and 10.2(c)), (i) if an amendment adversely affects the rights (not including any rights relating to the class c non-equity interests)&#160;of an individual limited partner or any related trust thereof (other than the ziff partner or any transferee thereof) other than on a pro rata basis with other holders of units of the same class, such individual limited partner must provide his prior written consent to the amendment, (ii) no amendment may adversely affect the rights (not including any rights relating to the class c non-equity interests) of the holders of a class of units (or any group of such holders) (other than the ziff partner or any transferee thereof) without the prior written consent of individual limited partners that (together with their related trusts) hold a majority of the outstanding units of such class (or of such group) then owned by all oz limited partners, (iii) the provisions of this section 10.2(a) may not be amended without the prior written consent of &#160; 52 &#160; individual limited partners that (together with their related trusts) hold a majority of the class a common units then owned by all oz limited partners, and (iv) the provisions of sections 8.3(a), 8.3(b) and 8.4 may only be amended with pmc approval.&#160;&#160;for the purposes of this section 10.2(a), any units owned by a related trust of an individual limited partner shall be treated as being owned by such individual limited partner.&#160;&#160;subject to the foregoing, and to the rights of the ziff partner in section 10.2(b) below, the general partner may enter into partner agreements with any limited partner that affect the terms hereof and the terms of such partner agreement shall govern with respect to such limited partner notwithstanding the provisions of&#160;this agreement. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; no amendment to this agreement (or any other action described in section 10.2(c)) which is materially adverse to the ziff partner may be made without the prior written consent of the ziff partner, unless such amendment (or such other action) similarly affects all or a substantial number of the other partners, in which case the consent of the ziff partner shall not be required; provided, however, that no amendment (or such other action) may be made without the prior written consent of the ziff partner if such amendment (or such other action) would have the effect of (i) adversely altering the rights of holders of class a common units without similarly altering the rights of holders of class b common units, except to the extent that such alteration of the rights of holders of class a common units is required by applicable law or regulation, (ii) adversely altering the ziff partner&#8217;s rights to transfer its interest or to participate in any registrations pursuant to the registration rights agreement or section 8.5, except to the extent that such alteration is required by applicable law or regulation, (iii) reducing the ziff partner's interest in greater proportion than the interests of daniel s. och and his related trusts in class a common units is reduced, (iv) reducing distributions to the ziff partner in greater proportion than distributions to daniel s. och and his related trusts, solely in his capacity as a holder of class a common units and not in any other capacity including his capacity as a holder of class c non-equity interests, are reduced, or (v) reducing distributions to the ziff partner in greater proportion than distributions to the holders of class b common units are reduced.&#160;&#160;except as expressly set forth in this section 10.2(b), the ziff partner and its successors, assigns, heirs and transferees shall have no voting, consent or approval rights with respect to any matter. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; it is acknowledged and agreed that none of the admission of any additional partner, the adoption of any unit designation, the issuance of any units or class c non-equity interests, or the delegation of any power or authority to any committee (or its chairman) shall be considered an amendment of this agreement that requires the approval of any limited partner; provided that any such action shall be subject to section 10.2(b). &#160; section 10.3 &#160;&#160; successors, counterparts .&#160;&#160;this agreement and any amendment hereto in accordance with section 10.2 shall be binding as to executors, administrators, estates, heirs and legal successors, or nominees or representatives, of the partners, and may be executed in several counterparts with the same effect as if the parties executing the several counterparts had all executed one counterpart. &#160;

&#160; (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;on or after the date of such breach, no sale, exchange, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, bequeath, creation of an encumbrance, or any other transfer or disposition of any kind may be made of any of the class a shares acquired by such partner or its related trusts, if any, through an exchange pursuant to the exchange agreement; &#160; (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;as of the applicable reallocation date, all of the unvested and vested class a common units of such partner and its related trusts, if any, and all allocations and distributions on such class a common units that would otherwise have been received by such partners on or after the date of such breach shall be reallocated from such partners&#160;to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts;

any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements, if any, in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his breach of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement.&#160;&#160;any continuing partner receiving reallocated class a common units pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be permitted to exchange fifty percent (50%) of such number of class a common units (and sell any class a shares issued in respect thereof), notwithstanding the transfer restrictions set forth in section 8.1 in the event that the exchange committee (as defined in the exchange agreement) determines in its sole discretion that the reallocation is taxable; provided, however, that such exchange of class a common units is made in accordance with the exchange agreement. &#160; (h)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything in section 2.13(g) to the contrary, the general partner may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to waive the application of any portion, all or none of the provisions of section 2.13(g) in the case of the breach by any partner of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement. &#160;

(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; special allocations .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; partnership minimum gain chargeback .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, each partner shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(c), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section 6.1(c) with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(c)(iii) and 6.1(c)(vi)).&#160;&#160; &#160; 36 &#160; this section 6.1(c)(i) is intended to comply with the partnership minimum gain chargeback requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 6.1 (other than section 6.1(c)(i)), except as provided in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, any partner with a share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(c), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section 6.1(c), other than section 6.1(c)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(c)(v) and 6.1(c)(vi), with respect to such taxable period.&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(c)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; qualified income offset .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in treasury regulation sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), items of partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the deficit balance, if any, in its adjusted capital account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless&#160;such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to section 6.1(c)(i) or (ii).&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(c)(iii) is intended to qualify and be construed as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; gross income allocations .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner has a deficit balance in its capital account at the end of any partnership taxable period in excess of the sum of (a) the amount such partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this agreement and (b) the amount such partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such partner shall be specially allocated items of partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this section 6.1(c)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such partner would have a deficit balance in its capital account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 6.1(c)(iv) were not in this agreement. &#160; (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests.&#160;&#160;if the general partner determines that the partnership's &#160; 37 &#160; nonrecourse deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the general partner is authorized, upon notice to the other partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements. &#160; (vi)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; partner nonrecourse deducti ons .&#160;&#160;partner nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the partner that bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i).&#160;&#160;if more than one partner bears the economic risk of loss with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt, such partner nonrecourse deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such economic risk of loss. &#160; (vii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; nonrecourse liabilities .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse liabilities of the partnership described in treasury regulation section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated among the partners in the manner chosen by the general partner and consistent with such treasury regulation. &#160; (viii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; code section 754 adjustments .&#160;&#160;to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any partnership asset pursuant to section 734(b) or 743(b) of the code is required, pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining capital accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the capital accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of&#160;the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their capital accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the treasury regulations. &#160; (ix)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; curative allocation .&#160;&#160;the required allocations are intended to comply with certain requirements of the treasury regulations.&#160;&#160;it is the intent of the partners that, to the extent possible, all required allocations shall be offset either with other required allocations or with special allocations of other items of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this section 6.1(c)(ix).&#160;&#160;therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this article vi (other than the required allocations), the general partner shall make such offsetting special allocations of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each partner's&#160;capital account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the capital account balance such partner would have had if the required allocations were not part of this agreement and all partnership items were allocated pursuant to the economic agreement among the partners. &#160; (x)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the general partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of section 6.1(c)(ix) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the required allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to section 6.1(c)(ix) among the partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; (xi)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the partnership shall specially allocate an amount of gross income equal to the expense amount to the general partner. &#160;

(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(a) in the case of a contributed property, such items attributable thereto shall be allocated among the partners in the manner provided under section 704(c) of the code that takes into account the variation between the agreed value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to a contributed property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(a) in the case of an adjusted property, such items attributable thereto shall (1) first, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with the principles of section 704(c) of the code to take into account the book-tax disparity of such property, and (2) second, in the event such property was originally a contributed property, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with section 6.2(b)(i)(a); and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to an adjusted property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the general partner may cause the partnership to eliminate book-tax disparities using any method or methods described in treasury regulation section 1.704-3 or that it determines is appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. &#160;

(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for purposes of determining the items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit allocable to any partner with respect to any period, such items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, quarterly or other basis, as determined by the general partner in&#160;its sole and absolute discretion using any permissible method under code section 706 and the regulations thereunder. &#160;

(b) for any reason &#160; 44 &#160; or no reason upon a determination by majority vote of the partner performance committee (which, if the partner performance committee has a chairman, may only be made upon the recommendation of such chairman) and notice of such determination to the individual limited partner from the partner performance committee; or (c) upon the individual limited partner otherwise (except as a result of death, disability or a special withdrawal) ceasing to be, or providing notice to the general partner of his intention to cease to be, actively involved with the partnership and its affiliates.&#160;&#160;in the event of the withdrawal of an individual limited partner, such individual limited partner's related trusts, if any, shall be subject to a required withdrawal. &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in the event of the withdrawal of an individual original partner prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date (other than where the withdrawal is due to a breach of any of the non-competition covenants in section 2.13(b), in which case the provisions of section 2.13(g) shall apply), all of the class a common units (including all distributions thereon that would otherwise be received after the date of withdrawal) of such individual original partner and its related trusts, if any, that have not yet vested in accordance with section 8.4 shall cease to vest with respect to such partners and upon the reallocation date&#160;shall be reallocated to each continuing partner in such a manner that each such continuing partner receives class a common units in proportion to the total number of original class a common units of such continuing partner and its original related trusts.&#160;&#160;any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 8.3(a) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his withdrawal; provided, however, that such continuing partner shall be permitted to exchange fifty percent (50%) of such number of class a common units (and sell any class a shares issued in respect thereof), notwithstanding the transfer restrictions set forth in section 8.1 in the event that the exchange committee (as defined in the exchange agreement) determines in its sole discretion that the reallocation is taxable; provided, however, that such exchange of class a common units is made in accordance with the exchange agreement. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; special withdrawal . &#160;

(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in the event of the special withdrawal of any limited partner, such limited partner's class a common units shall continue to vest in accordance with section 8.4. &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;upon a withdrawal or special withdrawal, an individual limited partner shall: (i) have no right to access or use the property of the partnership or its affiliates, and (ii) not be permitted to provide services to, or on behalf of, the partnership or its affiliates. &#160;

(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each oz limited partner acknowledges that, if he participates in a "tag-along sale" (as defined in the dic sahir transaction agreement), dic sahir has certain "tag-along rights" as set forth in the dic sahir transaction agreement and such oz limited partner agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8.5, in the event he does participate in such a "tag-along sale" then he will act in accordance with the provisions in the dic sahir transaction agreement relating to "tag-along rights" as if it were a party thereto. &#160;

except as provided in this agreement, the death, disability, resignation, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of any partner or the occurrence of any other event which terminates the continued participation of any partner in the partnership shall not cause the partnership to be dissolved or its affairs wound up; provided, however, that at any time after the bankruptcy of the general partner, the holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units may, pursuant to prior written consent to such effect, replace the general partner with another person, who shall, after executing a written instrument confirming such person's agreement to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this agreement, (i) become a successor general partner for all purposes hereunder, (ii) be vested with the powers and rights of the replaced general partner, and (iii) be liable for all obligations and responsible for all duties of the replaced general partner from the date of such replacement. &#160;

section 9.3 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; liquidator .&#160;&#160;upon dissolution of the partnership, the general partner may select one or more persons to act as a liquidating trustee for the partnership (such person, or the general partner, the " liquidator ").&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by &#160; 48 &#160; notice of removal approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;upon dissolution, death, incapacity, removal or resignation of the liquidator, a successor and substitute liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by the general partner (or, in the case of the removal of the liquidator by holders of units, by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation)).&#160;&#160;the right to approve a successor or substitute liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute liquidator approved in the manner herein provided.&#160;&#160;except as expressly provided in this section 9.3, the liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the general partner under the terms of this agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the partnership as provided for herein. &#160; section 9.4 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; liquidation .&#160;&#160;the liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the liquidator, subject to section 17-804 of the act and the following: &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;subject to section 9.4(d), the assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more partners on such terms as the liquidator and such partner or partners may agree.&#160;&#160;if any property is distributed in kind, the partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of section 9.4(d) to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other partners.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the partners understand and acknowledge that a partner may be compelled to accept a distribution&#160;of any asset in kind from the partnership despite the fact that the percentage of the asset distributed to such partner exceeds the percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which such partner shares in distributions from the partnership.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the partnership's assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may distribute the partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;liabilities of the partnership include amounts owed to the liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of section 9.3) and amounts to partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under article vii.&#160;&#160;with respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment.&#160;&#160;when paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be applied to other liabilities or distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. &#160; 49 &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;subject to the terms of any unit designation, all property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in section 9.4(b) shall be distributed to the partners in accordance with and to the extent of the positive balances in their respective capital accounts, as determined after taking into account all capital account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions&#160;pursuant to this section 9.4(c)) for the taxable year of the partnership during which the liquidation of the partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined by the general partner) and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence). &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if, upon the dissolution and liquidation of the partnership pursuant to this article ix and after all other allocations provided for in section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 9.4 were not in this agreement, either (i) the positive capital account balance attributable to one or more units having a liquidation preference is not equal to such liquidation preference, or (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the positive balance of a partner's capital account with respect to common units by the aggregate of all partners' capital account balances with respect to common units at such time would differ from such partner's percentage interest, then the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may decide that net income (and items thereof) and net loss (and items thereof) for the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and liquidates pursuant to this article ix shall be allocated among the partners (x) first, to the extent necessary to ensure that the capital account balance attributable to a unit having a liquidation preference is equal to such liquidation preference, and (y) second, in a manner such that the positive balance in the capital account of each partner with respect to common units, immediately after giving effect to such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to each such partner's percentage interest.&#160;&#160;the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may apply the principles of this section 9.4(d) to any fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and terminates (including through application of section 761(e) of the code) if delaying application of the principles of this section 9.4(d) would likely result in capital account balances that are materially different from the capital account balances set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the preceding sentence. &#160; section 9.5 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; capital account restorati on .&#160;&#160;no partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its capital account upon liquidation of the partnership. &#160; &#160; article x &#160; miscellaneous &#160; section 10.1 &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; incorporation of agreements .&#160;&#160;the exchange agreement and the tax receivable agreement shall each be treated as part of this agreement as described in section 761(c) of the code and treasury regulation sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c). &#160;

(b) &#160;&#160; intellectual property .&#160;&#160;(i) each partner acknowledges and agrees that the intellectual property shall be the sole and exclusive property of the partnership and such partner shall have no right, title, or interest in or to the intellectual property. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; all copyrightable material included in the intellectual property shall be deemed a "work made for hire" under the applicable copyright law, to the maximum extent permitted under such applicable copyright law, and ownership of all rights therein shall vest in the partnership.&#160;&#160;to the extent that a partner may retain any interest in any intellectual property by operation of law or otherwise, such partner hereby assigns and transfers to the partnership his or her entire right, title and interest in and to all such intellectual property. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; each partner hereby covenants and binds himself and his successors, assigns, and legal representatives to cooperate fully and promptly with the partnership and its designee, successors, and assigns, at the partnership's reasonable expense, and to do all acts necessary or requested by the partnership and its designee, successors, and assigns, to secure, maintain, enforce, and defend the partnership's rights in the intellectual property.&#160;&#160;each partner further agrees, and binds himself and his successors, assigns, and legal representatives, to cooperate fully and assist the partnership in every way possible in the&#160;application for, or prosecution of, all rights pertaining to the intellectual property. &#160; 20 &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; if a partner commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of section 2.12(a) or section 2.12(b), the general partner shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of such section specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or&#160;threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to the partnership, the other partners, any person included within the och-ziff group, and the investments, accounts and funds managed by persons included within the och-ziff group and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such persons.&#160;&#160;such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. &#160; section 2.13 &#160;&#160; non-competition; non-solicitation; non-disparagement; non-interfere nce; and remedies . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; each individual limited partner acknowledges and agrees, in connection with such individual limited partner's participation in the partnership on the terms described herein and this amendment and restatement of the terms of the original partnership agreement or, in the case of an individual limited partner admitted to the partnership subsequent to the date hereof, such individual limited partner's admission on the terms described herein and in any partner agreement, that:&#160;&#160;(i) the alternative asset management business (including, without limitation, for purposes of this paragraph, any hedge or private equity fund management business) is intensely competitive, (ii) such partner, for the benefit of and on behalf of the partnership in his capacity as a partner, has developed, and will continue to develop and have access to and knowledge of, confidential information (including, but not limited to, material non-public information of the och-ziff group and its investors), (iii) the direct or indirect use of any such information for the benefit of, or disclosure of any such information to, any existing or potential competitors of the och-ziff group would place the och-ziff group at a competitive disadvantage and would do damage to the och-ziff group, (iv) such partner, for the benefit of and on behalf of the partnership in his capacity as a partner, has developed relationships with investors and counterparties through investment by and resources of the och-ziff group, while a limited partner of the partnership, (v) such partner, for the benefit of and on behalf of the partnership in his capacity as a partner, may continue to develop relationships with investors and counterparties, through investment by and resources of the och-ziff group, while a limited partner of the partnership, (vi) such partner engaging in any of the activities prohibited by this section 2.13 would constitute improper appropriation and/or use of the och-ziff group's confidential information and/or investor and counterparty relationships, (vii) such partner's association with the och-ziff group has been critical, and such partner's association with the och-ziff group is expected to continue to be critical, to the success of the och-ziff group, (viii) the services to be rendered,&#160;and relationships developed, for the benefit of and on behalf of the partnership in his capacity as a partner, are of a special and unique character, (ix) the och-ziff group conducts the alternative asset management business throughout the world, (x) the non-competition and other restrictive covenants and agreements set forth in this agreement are fair and reasonable, and (xi) in light of the foregoing and of such partner's education, skills, abilities and financial resources, such partner acknowledges and&#160;agrees that such partner will not assert, and it should not be considered, that enforcement of any of the covenants set forth in this section 2.13 would prevent such partner from earning a living or otherwise are void, voidable or unenforceable or should be voided or held unenforceable. &#160; 21 &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; during the restricted period, each individual limited partner will not, directly or indirectly, either on his own behalf or on behalf of or with any other person: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; without the prior written consent of the general partner, (a) engage or otherwise participate in any manner or fashion in any competing business, (b) render any services to any competing business, or (c) acquire a financial interest in or become actively involved with any competing business (other than as a passive investor holding less than 2% of the issued and outstanding stock of public companies);

(c) &#160;&#160; during the restricted period, each individual limited partner will not, directly or indirectly, either on his own behalf or on behalf of or with any other person: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; in any manner solicit or induce any of the och-ziff group's current, former or prospective financing sources, capital market intermediaries, consultants, suppliers, partners or other counterparties to terminate (or diminish in any material respect) his relationship with the och-ziff group for the purpose of associating with any competing business, or otherwise encourage such financing sources, capital market intermediaries, consultants, suppliers, partners or other counterparties to terminate (or diminish in any respect) his relationship with the och-ziff group for any other reason; or &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; in any manner interfere with the och-ziff group's business relationship with any investors, financing sources, capital market intermediaries, consultants, suppliers, partners or other counterparties. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; during the restricted period, each individual limited partner will not, directly or indirectly, either on his own behalf or on behalf of or with any other person, in any manner solicit any of the owners, members, partners, directors, officers or employees of any member of the och-ziff group to terminate their relationship or employment with the applicable member of the och-ziff group, or hire any such person (i) who is employed at the time of such solicitation by any member of the och-ziff group, (ii) who is or was once an owner, member, partner, director, officer or employee of any member of the och-ziff group as of the date of special withdrawal or withdrawal of such partner, or (iii) whose employment or relationship with any such member of the och-ziff group terminated within the 24-month period prior to the date of special withdrawal or withdrawal of such partner or thereafter.&#160;&#160;additionally, the partner may not solicit or encourage to cease to work with any member of the och-ziff group any consultant, agent or adviser that the partner knows or should know is under contract with any member of the och-ziff group. &#160; 22 &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; during the restricted period and at all times thereafter, each individual limited partner will not, directly or indirectly, make, or cause to be made, any written or oral statement, observation, or opinion disparaging the business or reputation of the och-ziff group, or any owners, partners, members, directors, officers, or employees of any member of the och-ziff group; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section 2.13 shall preclude such partner from providing truthful testimony in response to a valid subpoena, court order, regulatory request, or as may be otherwise required by law, or from participating or cooperating in any action, investigation or proceeding with, or providing truthful information to, any governmental agency, legislative body, self-regulatory organization, or the legal departments of the och-ziff group. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; each individual limited partner acknowledges and agrees that an attempted or threatened breach by such person of this section 2.13 would cause irreparable injury to the partnership and the other members of the och-ziff group not compensable in money damages and the partnership shall be entitled, in addition to the remedies set forth in sections 2.13(g) and 2.13(i), to obtain a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction prohibiting any breaches of this section 2.13 without being required to prove damages or furnish any bond or other security. &#160; (g) &#160;&#160; each individual limited&#160;partner agrees that it would be impossible to compute the actual damages resulting from a breach of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, any of the non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement, and that the amounts set forth in this section 2.13(g) are reasonable&#160;and do not operate as a penalty, but are a genuine pre-estimate of the anticipated loss&#160;that the partnership and other members of the och-ziff group would suffer from a breach of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of any of the non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement. &#160; in the event an individual limited partner breaches section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, any of the non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement, then: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; on or after the date of such breach, any unvested class a common units of such partner and its related trusts, if any, shall cease to vest and thereafter shall be reallocated in accordance with this section 2.13(g); &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; on or after the date of such breach, no allocations shall be made to the respective capital accounts of such partner and its related trusts, if any, and no distributions shall be made to such partners; &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; on or after the date of such breach, no transfer (including any exchange pursuant to the exchange agreement) of any of the class a common units of such partner or its related trusts, if any, shall be permitted under any circumstances notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement; &#160; (iv) &#160;&#160; on or after the date of such breach, no sale, exchange, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, bequeath, creation of an encumbrance, or any other transfer or disposition of any kind may be made of any of the class a shares acquired by such partner or its related trusts, if any, through an exchange pursuant to the exchange agreement; &#160; 23 &#160; (v) &#160;&#160; as of the applicable reallocation date, all of the unvested and vested class a common units of such partner and its related trusts, if any, and all allocations and distributions on such class a common units that would otherwise have been received by such partners on or after the date of such breach shall be reallocated from such partners&#160;to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts; &#160; (vi) &#160;&#160; each of such partner and its related trusts, if any, agrees that, on the reallocation date, it shall immediately: &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; pay to the continuing partners, in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts, a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of: (i) the total &#160; after-tax proceeds received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof for any class a shares acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and that were subsequently transferred during the 24-month period prior to the date of such breach; and (ii) any distributions received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof during such 24-month period on class a shares acquired pursuant to the exchange agreement; &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; transfer any class a shares that were acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and held by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof on and after the date of such breach to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts; and &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; pay to the continuing partners in proportion to the total number of original class a common units owned by each such continuing partner and its original related trusts&#160;a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of: (i)&#160;the total after-tax proceeds received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof for any class a shares acquired at any time pursuant to the exchange agreement and that were subsequently transferred on or after the date of such breach; and (ii) all distributions received by such individual limited partner or related trust thereof on or after the date of such breach on class a shares acquired pursuant to the exchange agreement;&#160;and &#160; (vii) &#160;&#160; such partner and its related trusts agrees that he shall receive no payments, if any, that he would have otherwise received under the tax receivable agreement on or after the date of such breach, and shall have no further rights under the tax receivable agreement, exchange agreement or registration rights agreement after such date. &#160; any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements, if any, in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his breach of section 2.13(b) &#160; 24 &#160; or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement.&#160;&#160;any continuing partner receiving reallocated class a common units pursuant to this section 2.13(g) shall be permitted to exchange fifty percent (50%) of such number of class a common units (and sell any class a shares issued in respect thereof), notwithstanding the transfer restrictions set forth in section 8.1 in the event that the exchange committee (as defined in the exchange agreement) determines in its sole discretion that the reallocation is taxable; provided, however, that such exchange of class a common units is made in accordance with the exchange agreement. &#160; (h) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding anything in section 2.13(g) to the contrary, the general partner may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to waive the application of any portion, all or none of the provisions of section 2.13(g) in the case of the breach by any partner of section 2.13(b) or, if applicable, of the relevant non-competition covenants provided in such partner's partner agreement. &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; without limiting the right of the partnership to obtain injunctive relief for any attempted or threatened breach of this section 2.13, in the event a partner breaches section 2.13(c), (d) or (e), then at the election of the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion the partnership shall be entitled to seek any other available remedies including, but not limited to, an award of money damages. &#160; section 2.14 &#160;&#160; insurance .&#160;&#160;the partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, to the extent and in such amounts as the general partner shall deem reasonable, on behalf of covered persons and such other persons as the general partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by any such person in connection with the activities of the partnership and/or its subsidiaries regardless of whether the partnership would have the power or obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this agreement.&#160;&#160;the partnership may enter into indemnity contracts with covered persons and such other persons as the general partner shall determine and adopt written procedures pursuant to which arrangements are made for the advancement of expenses and the funding of obligations under this section 2.14, and containing such other procedures regarding indemnification as are appropriate and consistent with this agreement. &#160; section 2.15 &#160;&#160; representations and warranties .&#160;&#160;each partner hereby represents and warrants to the others and to the partnership as follows: &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; such partner has all requisite power to execute, deliver and perform this agreement;

section 2.18 &#160;&#160; short s elling and hedging transactions . &#160; while each partner (including the ziff partner) is a limited partner of the partnership (irrespective of whether or not a special withdrawal or withdrawal has occurred in respect of such partner) and at all times thereafter (other than with respect to the ziff partner), such partner and its affiliates shall not, without pmc approval, directly or indirectly, (a) effect any short sale (as such term is defined in regulation sho under the exchange act) of class a shares or any short sale of any related security, or (b) enter into any swap or other transaction, other than a sale (which is not a short sale) of class a shares or any related security to the extent permitted by this agreement, that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic risks, benefits or consequences of ownership of class a shares or any related security.&#160;&#160;the foregoing clause (b) is expressly agreed to preclude each partner and its affiliates, while such partner (including the ziff partner) &#160; 26 &#160; is a limited partner of the partnership (irrespective of whether or not a special withdrawal or withdrawal has occurred in respect of such partner) and at all times thereafter (other than with respect to the ziff partner), from engaging in any hedging or other transaction (other than a sale, which is not a short sale, of class a shares or any related security to the extent permitted by this agreement) which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a transfer of the economic risks, benefits or consequences of ownership of class a shares or any related security, or a disposition of class a shares or any related security, even if such transfer or disposition would be made by someone other than such partner or affiliate thereof or any person contracting directly with such partner or affiliate. &#160;

(ii) &#160;&#160; any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the partnership's carrying value with respect to such property as of such date. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; the capital account balance of each partner and the carrying value of all partnership property shall be adjusted in accordance with the rules set forth in treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) to reflect the partner's allocable share (as determined under article iv) of the items of net income or net loss that would be &#160; 36 &#160; realized by the partnership if it sold all of its property at its fair market value (taking code section 7701(g) into account) on (a) the date of the acquisition of any additional interest in the partnership by any new or existing partner in exchange for more than a de minimis capital contribution;

(c) &#160;&#160; a transferee of units shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the capital account of the transferor relating to the units so transferred, unless otherwise determined by the general partner. &#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial general partner shall not succeed to any portion of any of the capital accounts of the holders of class a common units that are purchased by the partnership with the proceeds received from the ipo and the dic sahir transaction to the extent attributable to pre-closing allocations or deferred income allocations. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in this agreement, no partner shall have the right to request, demand, or receive any distribution in respect of such partner's capital account from the partnership (other than as expressly provided in article vii or article ix). &#160; section 5.3 &#160;&#160; determinations by general partner .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in this agreement, in the event the general partner shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the capital accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to effectuate the intended economic sharing arrangement of the partners, the general partner may make such modification. &#160;

37 &#160; respect of each such partner for such taxable year and, second, in accordance with the respective percentage interests of the partners. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; net loss .&#160;&#160;subject to the terms of any unit designation, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in section 6.1(d), net loss for each taxable period and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing net loss for such taxable period shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests; provided, however, that to the extent&#160;any allocation of net loss would cause any partner to have a deficit balance in its adjusted capital account at the end of such taxable year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its adjusted capital account), such allocation of net loss shall be reallocated among the other partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; deferred income allocations &#160; and pre-closing allocations. &#160;&#160;deferred income allocations shall be made&#160;among the original deferral partners&#160;in accordance with the relevant deferred income allocation plans.&#160;&#160;pre-closing allocations shall be made among the original partners and the ziff partner&#160;in accordance with such partners' interests in the partnership, as determined by the general partner. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; special allocations .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; partnership minimum gain chargeback .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, each partner shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(d), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(d)(iii) and 6.1(d)(vi)).&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the partnership minimum gain chargeback requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 6.1 (other than section 6.1(d)(i)), except as provided in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain during any partnership taxable period, any partner with a share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 6.1(d), each partner's adjusted capital account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this section &#160; 38 &#160; 6.1(d), other than section 6.1(d)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to section 6.1(d)(v) and 6.1(d)(vi), with respect to such taxable period.&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; qualified income offset .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in treasury regulation sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6), items of partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the deficit balance, if any, in its adjusted capital account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to section 6.1(d)(i) or (ii).&#160;&#160;this section 6.1(d)(iii) is intended to qualify and be construed as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. &#160; (iv) &#160;&#160; gross income all ocations .&#160;&#160;in the event any partner has a deficit balance in its capital account at the end of any partnership taxable period in excess of the sum of (a) the amount such partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this agreement and (b) the amount such partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to treasury regulation sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such partner shall be specially allocated items of partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such partner would have a deficit balance in its capital account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 6.1(d)(iv) were not in this agreement. &#160; (v) &#160;&#160; nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests.&#160;&#160;if the general partner determines that the partnership's nonrecourse deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the treasury regulations promulgated under section 704(b) of the code, the general partner is authorized, upon notice to the other partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements. &#160; (vi) &#160;&#160; partner nonrecourse deductions .&#160;&#160;partner nonrecourse deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the partner that bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with treasury regulation section 1.704-2(i).&#160;&#160;if more than one partner bears the economic risk of loss with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt, such partner nonrecourse deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such economic risk of loss. &#160; 39 &#160; (vii) &#160;&#160; nonrecourse liabilities .&#160;&#160;nonrecourse liabilities of the partnership described in treasury regulation section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated among the partners in the manner chosen by the general partner and consistent with such treasury regulation. &#160; (viii) &#160;&#160; c ode section 754 adjustments .&#160;&#160;to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any partnership asset pursuant to section 734(b) or 743(b) of the code is required, pursuant to treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining capital accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the capital accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their capital accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the treasury regulations. &#160; (ix) &#160;&#160; curative allocation .&#160;&#160;the required allocations are intended to comply with certain requirements of the treasury regulations.&#160;&#160;it is the intent of the partners that, to the extent possible, all required allocations shall be offset either with other required allocations or with special allocations of other items of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this section 6.1(d)(ix).&#160;&#160;therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this article vi (other than the required allocations), the general partner shall make such offsetting special allocations of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each partner's capital account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the capital account balance such&#160;partner would have had if the required allocations were not part of this agreement and all partnership items were allocated pursuant to the economic agreement among the partners. &#160; (x) &#160;&#160; the general partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of section 6.1(d)(ix) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the required allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to section 6.1(d)(ix) among the partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions. &#160; (xi) &#160;&#160; the partnership shall specially allocate an amount of gross income equal to the expense amount to the general partner. &#160; section 6.2 &#160;&#160; allocations for tax purposes . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; except as otherwise provided herein, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; in an attempt to eliminate book-tax disparities attributable to a contributed property or an adjusted property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, &#160; 40 &#160; amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for u.s. federal income tax purposes among the partners as follows: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; (a) in the case of a contributed property, such items attributable thereto shall be allocated among the partners in the manner provided under section 704(c) of the code that takes into account the variation between the agreed value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to a contributed property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; (a) in the case of an adjusted property, such items attributable thereto shall (1) first, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with the principles of section 704(c) of the code to take into account the book-tax disparity of such property, and (2) second, in the event such property was originally a contributed property, be allocated among the partners in a manner consistent with section 6.2(b)(i)(a); and (b) any item of residual gain or residual loss attributable to an adjusted property shall be allocated among the partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to section 6.1. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; the general partner may cause the partnership to eliminate book-tax disparities using any method or methods described in treasury regulation section 1.704-3 or that it determines is appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; for the proper administration of the partnership, the general partner, as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion is necessary or appropriate to execute the provisions of this agreement and to comply with u.s. federal, state and local tax law, may (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including, without limitation, gross income) or deductions; (iii) amend the provisions of this agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of treasury regulations under section 704(b) or section 704(c) of the code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the units (or any class or classes thereof); and (iv) adopt and employ methods for (a) the maintenance of capital accounts for book and tax purposes, (b) the determination and allocation of adjustments under sections 704(c), 734 and 743 of the code, (c) the determination and allocation of taxable income, tax loss and items thereof under this agreement and pursuant to the code, (d) the determination of the identities and tax classification of holders of units, (e) the provision of tax information and reports to the holders of units, (f) the adoption of reasonable conventions and methods for the valuation of assets and the determination of tax basis, (g) the allocation of asset values and tax basis, (h) the adoption and maintenance of accounting methods, (i) the recognition of the transfer of units and (j) tax compliance and other tax-related requirements, including without limitation, the use of computer software. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes and allocated to the partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under section 754 &#160; 41 &#160; of the code that may be made by the partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by sections 734 and 743 of the code. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; for purposes of determining the items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit allocable to any partner with respect to any period, such items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, quarterly or other basis, as determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion using any permissible method under code section 706 and the regulations thereunder. &#160; &#160; article vii &#160; distributions &#160; section 7.1 &#160;&#160; distributions . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; no partner shall have the right to withdraw capital or demand or receive distributions or other returns of any amount in his capital account, except as expressly provided in this article vii or article ix. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; subject to the terms of any unit designation, distributions in respect of units shall be made to the partners in the following order: &#160; (i) &#160;&#160; first, tax distributions shall be made pursuant to section 7.3; &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; second, an expense amount distribution&#160;shall be made pursuant to section 7.4. &#160; (iii) &#160;&#160; third, distributions, if any, shall be made to the relevant limited partners in respect of class c non-equity interests as and when determined by class c approval. &#160; (iv) &#160;&#160; fourth, distributions shall be made as and when determined by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion in accordance with the partners' respective percentage interests. &#160; (v) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the management fee distributions, term loan distributions, and distributions in respect of deferred income allocations shall be made exclusively to the applicable original partners and the ziff partner and&#160;(b) in the event of a sale or dissolution of the partnership, all distributions shall be made in accordance with section 9.4. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; amounts received (including amounts withheld in respect of taxes or other governmental charges from such amounts so received) by any partner pursuant to a partner agreement with any subsidiary of the partnership relating to the performance of services&#160;to or for the benefit of such subsidiary by such partner during any period beginning on or after &#160; 42 &#160; the date of such partner's admission to the partnership shall be treated as distributions made to such partner with respect to such period (and, if required, future periods) for all purposes of this agreement, and such amounts shall reduce amounts otherwise distributable to the partner pursuant to this agreement with respect to such period (or such future periods). &#160; section 7.2 &#160;&#160; distributions in kind .&#160;&#160;the general partner may cause the partnership to make distributions of assets in kind in its sole and absolute discretion.&#160;&#160;whenever the distributions provided for in section 7.1 shall be distributable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property determined by the general partner in good faith, and in the event of such a distribution there shall be allocated to the partners in accordance with article vi the amount of net income or net loss that would result if the distributed asset had been sold for an amount in cash equal to its fair market value at the time of the distribution.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, net income or net loss that would result if any asset distributed to a partner in respect of deferred income allocations had been sold for cash equal to its fair market value at the time of the distribution shall be allocated pursuant to the foregoing sentence solely to the original deferral partners receiving the distribution of such asset.&#160;&#160;no partner shall have the right to demand that the partnership distribute any assets in kind to such partner. &#160; section 7.3 &#160;&#160; tax distributions .&#160;&#160;subject to &#167;17-607 of the act, and unless determined otherwise by the general partner in its sole discretion, the partnership shall make distributions to each partner for each calendar quarter ending after the date hereof as follows (collectively, the " tax distributions "): &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the first quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the first quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the second quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the second quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year; &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; on or before the 10th day following the end of the third quarterly period of each calendar year, an amount equal to such partner's presumed tax liability for the third quarterly period less the aggregate amount of prior distributions previously made to such partner during such calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year;

and &#160; 43 &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; tax distributions shall be made on the basis of a calendar year regardless of the fiscal year used by the partnership.&#160;&#160;to the extent the general partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion that the distributions made under the foregoing subsections (a) through (d) are insufficient to satisfy the partners' presumed tax liability for the applicable calendar year, on or before the april 10th immediately following the applicable calendar year, an amount that the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion will be sufficient to allow each partner to satisfy his presumed tax liability for the applicable calendar year, after taking into account all prior distributions made to the partners with respect to the applicable calendar year, excluding any tax distribution with respect to a previous calendar year. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, other than section 7.3(g), tax distributions shall be made: (i) to all partners pro rata in accordance with their percentage interests; and (ii) as if each distributee partner was allocated an amount of income in each quarterly period in respect of such partner's units equal to the product of (x) the highest amount of income allocated to any partner with respect to his units, calculated on a per-unit basis, taking into account any income allocations pursuant to section 6.2 hereof and disregarding any adjustment required by section 734 or section 743 of the code, multiplied by (y) the amount of units held by such distributee partner. &#160; (g) &#160;&#160; subject to the limitations set forth in this section 7.3, the partnership shall make distributions in respect of the tax liability of a partner arising from the allocation of any items hereunder to class c non-equity interests applying principles similar to the principles for determining tax distributions and presumed tax liability, and amounts so allocated, determined or distributed with respect to class c non-equity interests of a partner shall not be taken into account in determining any tax distributions in respect of units. &#160; section 7.4 &#160;&#160; expense amount distributions .&#160;&#160;the partnership shall distribute any expense amount to the general partner at such times as the general partner shall determine in its sole discretion&#160;(an " expense amount distribution "). &#160;

restrictions on distributions .&#160;&#160;the foregoing provisions of this article vii to the contrary notwithstanding, no distribution shall be made: (a) if such distribution would violate any contract or agreement to which the partnership is then a party or any law, rule, regulation, order or directive of any governmental authority then applicable to the partnership; (b) to the extent that the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any amount otherwise distributable should be retained by the partnership to pay, or to establish a reserve for the payment of, any liability or obligation of the partnership, whether liquidated, fixed, contingent or otherwise; or (c) to the extent that the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that the cash available to the partnership is insufficient to permit such distribution. &#160; 44 &#160; article viii &#160; transfer or assignment of interest; cessation of partner status &#160; section 8.1 &#160;&#160; transfer and assignment of interest . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; oz limited partners .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, transfers of class a common units may only be made by oz limited partners (x) in accordance with the other provisions of this article viii (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions in section 8.4, except as expressly set forth in this section 8.1(a) in respect of transfers by original related trusts), and (y) subject to section 2.13(g).&#160;&#160;during the restricted period, no oz limited partner shall be permitted to transfer class a common units unless, following the date of such transfer, the relevant individual limited partner and its related trusts continue to hold in the aggregate at least 25% of the class a common units of such partners that have vested on or before the date of such transfer, without regard to dispositions (such requirements, the " minimum retained ownership requirements ").&#160;&#160;an oz limited partner may not transfer all or any of such partner's units without the prior written approval of the general partner, which approval may be granted or withheld, with or without reason, in the general partner's sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that, without the prior written approval of the general partner, (i) an original related trust may transfer its interest (including any unvested units) in accordance with its related trust supplementary agreement to the relevant subsequent related trust (provided, however, that such subsequent related trust remains subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring original related trust had been before its withdrawal), (ii)&#160;the related trust of any individual limited partner may, at any time, subject to section 2.13(g), transfer such related trust's class a common units (including any unvested units) to such individual limited partner as authorized by the terms of the relevant trust agreement (provided, however, that such individual limited partner remains subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring related trust had been before the transfer), and (iii) any oz limited partner may, at any time, subject to the minimum retained ownership requirements and section 2.13(g), and provided further that the relevant units have vested in accordance with section 8.4, (a) transfer any of such partner's units in accordance with the exchange agreement, (b) transfer any of such partner's units to a permitted transferee of such partner with pmc approval, which pmc approval may not be unreasonably withheld, (c) transfer the &#160;

provided, however, that any certificates of ownership presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the transfer agent duly executed by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.&#160;&#160;the transfer agent shall not be required to register a transfer of any units or exchange any certificate of ownership if such purported transfer would cause the partnership to violate the securities act, the exchange act, the investment company act (including by causing any violation of the laws, rules, regulations, orders and other directives of any governmental authority) or otherwise violate this section 8.1.&#160;&#160;in the event of any transfer, the transferring partner shall provide the address and facsimile number for each transferee as contemplated by section 10.10 and shall cause each transferee to agree in writing to comply with the terms of this agreement. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; publicly traded partnership .&#160;&#160;no transfer shall be permitted (and, if attempted, shall be void ab initio) if the general partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion&#160;that such a transfer would pose a risk that the partnership would be a "publicly traded partnership" as defined in section 7704 of the code. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; securities laws .&#160;&#160;each partner and each assignee thereof hereby agrees that it will not effect any transfer of all or any part of its interest in the partnership (whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law) in any manner contrary to the terms of this agreement or that violates or causes the partnership or the partners to violate the securities act, the exchange act, the investment company act, or the laws, rules, regulations, orders and other directives of any governmental authority. &#160;

(b) for any reason or no reason upon a determination by majority vote of the partner performance committee (which, if the partner performance committee has a chairman, may only be made upon the recommendation of such chairman) and notice of such determination to the individual limited partner from the partner performance committee; or (c) upon the individual limited partner otherwise (except as a result of death, disability or a special withdrawal) ceasing to be, or providing notice to the general partner of his intention to cease to be, actively involved with the partnership and its affiliates.&#160;&#160;in the event of the withdrawal of an individual limited partner, such individual limited partner's related trusts, if any, shall be subject to a required withdrawal. &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; in the event of the withdrawal of an individual original partner prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date (other than where the withdrawal is due to a breach of any of the non-competition covenants in section 2.13(b), in which case the provisions of section 2.13(g) shall apply), all of the class a common units (including all distributions thereon that would otherwise be received after the date of withdrawal) of such individual original partner and its related trusts, if any, that have not yet vested in accordance with section 8.4 shall cease to vest with respect to such partners and upon the reallocation date shall be reallocated to each continuing partner in such a manner that each such continuing partner receives class a common units in proportion to the total number of original class a common units of such continuing partner and its original related trusts.&#160;&#160;any reallocated class a common units received by a continuing partner pursuant to this section 8.3(a) shall be deemed for all purposes of this agreement to be class a common units of such continuing partner and subject to the same vesting requirements in accordance with section 8.4 as the transferring limited partner had been before his withdrawal;

47 &#160; (ii) &#160;&#160; in the event of the special withdrawal of any limited partner, such limited partner's class a common units shall continue to vest in accordance with section 8.4. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;

(b) &#160;&#160; prior to the consummation of a tag-along sale, the oz limited partners participating in such tag-along sale (the " tag-along sellers ") shall cause the tag-along purchaser to offer in writing (such offer, a " tag-along offer ") to purchase each potential tag-along seller's tag-along securities.&#160;&#160;in addition, the tag-along offer shall set forth the consideration for which the tag-along sale is proposed to be made and all other material terms and conditions of the tag-along sale.&#160;&#160;if the&#160;tag-along offer is accepted by some or all of such potential tag-along sellers within five business days after its receipt then the number of class a shares and/or class a common units to be sold to the tag-along purchaser by the tag-along sellers shall be reduced by the number of class a shares and/or class a common units to be purchased by the tag-along purchaser from such accepting potential tag-along sellers.&#160;&#160;the purchase from the accepting potential tag-along sellers shall be made on the same terms and conditions (including timing of receipt of consideration and choice of consideration, if any) as the tag-along purchaser shall have offered to the tag-along sellers, and the accepting potential tag-along sellers shall otherwise be required to transfer the class a shares and/or class a common units to the tag-along purchaser upon the same terms, conditions, and provisions as the tag-along sellers, including making the same representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements that the tag-along sellers agree to make. &#160;

section 8.6 &#160;&#160; drag-along rights . &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; prior to the consummation of a proposed drag-along sale, the drag-along sellers may, at their option, require each other oz limited partner to sell its drag-along securities to the drag-along purchaser by giving written notice (the " notice ") to such other oz limited partners not later than ten business days prior to the consummation of the drag-along sale (the " drag-along right "); provided, however, that if the drag along right is exercised by the drag-along sellers, all oz limited partners shall sell their drag-along &#160; 49 &#160; securities to the drag-along purchaser on the same terms and conditions, including the class of security, the consideration per company security and the date of sale, as applicable to the drag-along sellers.&#160;&#160;the notice shall contain written notice of the exercise of the drag-along right pursuant to this section 8.6, setting forth the consideration to be paid by the drag-along purchaser and the other material terms and conditions of the drag-along sale. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; within five business days following the date of the notice, the drag-along sellers shall have delivered to them by the other oz limited partners their drag-along securities together with a limited power-of-attorney authorizing such drag-along sellers to sell such other oz limited partner's drag-along securities pursuant to the terms of the drag-along sale and such other transfer instruments and other documents as are reasonably requested by the drag-along sellers in order to effect such sale. &#160;

except as provided in this agreement, the death, disability, resignation, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of any partner or the occurrence of any other event which terminates the continued participation of any partner in the partnership shall not cause the partnership to be dissolved or its affairs wound up; provided, however, that at any time after the bankruptcy of the general partner, the holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units may, pursuant to prior written consent to such effect, replace the general partner with another person, who shall, after executing a written instrument confirming such person's agreement to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this agreement, (i) become a successor general partner for all purposes hereunder, (ii) be vested with the powers and rights of the replaced general partner, and (iii) be liable for all obligations and responsible for all duties of the replaced general partner from the date of such replacement. &#160; section 9.2 &#160;&#160; notice of liquidation .&#160;&#160;the general partner shall give each of the partners prompt written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the partnership. &#160; 50 &#160; section 9.3 &#160;&#160; liquidator .&#160;&#160;upon dissolution of the partnership, the general partner may select one or more persons to act as a liquidating trustee for the partnership (such person, or the general partner, the " liquidator ").&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;the liquidator (if other than the general partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation).&#160;&#160;upon dissolution, death, incapacity, removal or resignation of the liquidator, a successor and substitute liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by the general partner (or, in the case of the removal of the liquidator by holders of units, by holders of a majority of the outstanding class b common units (subject to the terms of any unit designation)).&#160;&#160;the right to approve a successor or substitute liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute liquidator approved in the manner herein provided.&#160;&#160;except as expressly provided in this section 9.3, the liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the general partner under the terms of this agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the partnership as provided for herein. &#160; section 9.4 &#160;&#160; liquidation .&#160;&#160;the liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the liquidator, subject to section 17-804 of the act and the following: &#160; (a) &#160;&#160; subject to section 9.4(d), the assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more partners on such terms as the liquidator and such partner or partners may agree.&#160;&#160;if any property is distributed in kind, except with respect to deferred fees, the partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of section 9.4(d) to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other partners.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the partners understand and acknowledge that a partner may be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from the partnership despite the fact that the percentage of the asset distributed to such partner exceeds the percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which such partner shares in distributions from the partnership.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the partnership's assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners.&#160;&#160;the liquidator may distribute the partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160; liabilities of the partnership include amounts owed to the liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of section 9.3) and amounts to partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under article vii.&#160;&#160;with &#160; 51 &#160; respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment.&#160;&#160;when paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be applied to other liabilities or distributed as additional liquidation proceeds. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; subject to the terms of any unit designation and except as otherwise provided in this agreement&#160;with respect to&#160;distributions of the proceeds of deferred fees and management fee distributions, all property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in section 9.4(b) shall be distributed to the partners in accordance with and to the extent of the positive balances in their respective capital accounts, as determined after taking into account all capital account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this section 9.4(c)) for the taxable year of the partnership during which the liquidation of the partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined by the general partner) and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence). &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if, upon the dissolution and liquidation of the partnership pursuant to this article ix and after all other allocations provided for in section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this section 9.4 were not in this agreement, either (i) the positive capital account balance attributable to one or more units having a liquidation preference is not equal to such liquidation preference, or (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the positive balance of a partner's capital account with respect to common units by the aggregate of all partners' capital account balances with respect to common units at such time would differ from such partner's percentage interest, then the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may decide that net income (and items thereof) and net loss (and items thereof) for the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and liquidates pursuant to this article ix shall be allocated among the partners (x) first, to the extent necessary to ensure that the capital account balance attributable to a unit having a liquidation preference is equal to such liquidation preference, and (y) second, in a manner such that the positive balance in the capital account of each partner with respect to common units, immediately after giving effect to such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to each such partner's percentage interest.&#160;&#160;the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may apply the principles of this section 9.4(d) to any fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the partnership dissolves and terminates (including through application of section 761(e) of the code) if delaying application of the principles of this section 9.4(d) would likely result in capital account balances that are materially different from the capital account balances set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the preceding sentence. &#160; section 9.5 &#160;&#160; capital account restoration .&#160;&#160;no partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its capital account upon liquidation of the partnership. &#160;

provided, however, that no amendment (or such other action) may be made without the prior written consent of the ziff partner if such amendment (or such other action) would have the effect of (i) adversely altering the rights of holders of class a common units without similarly altering the rights of holders of class b common units, except to the extent that such alteration of the rights of holders of class a common units is required by applicable law or regulation, (ii) adversely altering the ziff partner&#8217;s rights to transfer its interest or to participate in any registrations pursuant to the registration rights agreement or section 8.5, except to the extent that such alteration is required by applicable law or regulation, (iii) reducing the ziff partner's interest in greater proportion than the interests of daniel s. och &#160; 53 &#160; and his related trusts in class a common units is reduced, (iv) reducing distributions to the ziff partner in greater proportion than distributions to daniel s. och and his related trusts, solely in his capacity as a holder of class a common units and not in any other capacity including his capacity as a holder of class c non-equity interests, are reduced, or (v) reducing distributions to the ziff partner in greater proportion than distributions to the holders of class b common units are reduced.&#160;&#160;except as expressly set forth in this section 10.2(b), the ziff partner and its successors, assigns, heirs and transferees shall have no voting, consent or approval rights with respect to any matter. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; it is acknowledged and agreed that none of the admission of any additional partner, the adoption of any unit designation, the issuance of any units or class c non-equity interests, or the delegation of any power or authority to any committee (or its chairman) shall be considered an amendment of this agreement that requires the approval of any limited partner; provided that any such action shall be subject to section 10.2(b). &#160; section 10.3 &#160;&#160; successors, counterparts .&#160;&#160;this agreement and any amendment hereto in accordance with section 10.2 shall be binding as to executors, administrators, estates, heirs and legal successors, or nominees or representatives, of the partners, and may be executed in several counterparts with the same effect as if the parties executing the several counterparts had all executed one counterpart. &#160;
