for the financing transactions contemplated hereby, to assign any portion of the commitment to one or more of its affiliates, financing sources or other investors, and only upon the actual funding of such assigned portion of the commitment to parent in accordance with this letter effective upon the closing, vista shall have no further obligation to parent (or any other person) with respect to such
