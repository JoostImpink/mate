and cash, as described above. the exchange agreement provides that the issuer&rsquo;s determination under the exchange agreement of the method used for settlement of the exchange (i.e., stock, cash or

only exchange up to 25% of the aggregate number of class a units held as of the first day of such 12-month period in which the exchange occurs. this limitation will expire after the first exchange

sale of all class a units held by the issuer; a person or group of persons (within the meaning of section 13(d) of the act) becoming the beneficial owner of a majority of the issuer&rsquo;s voting

majority of the board of directors of the resulting entity or the issuer&rsquo;s voting securities do not represent a majority of the voting securities of the resulting entity. the exchange agreement

the zgp llc agreement or other agreements of the company or zais group to which the holder of units may be subject. zgp or the issuer may impose additional restrictions on exchanges that it determines
