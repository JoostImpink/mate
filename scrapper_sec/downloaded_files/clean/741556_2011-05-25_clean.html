meeting, the subsequent withdrawal of shareholders, so as to reduce the number of shares entitled to vote at the meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting, unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. when a specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class or series of stock, a majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business by that class or series. 1.10 votes per share . except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by the act, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. 1.11 manner of action . if a quorum is present, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater or lesser number of affirmative votes is required by the articles of incorporation or by law. 1.12 voting for directors . at each election for directors, every shareholder entitled to vote at such election shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by him or her for as many persons as there are directors to be elected at that time and for whose election he or she has a right to vote. unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, cumulative voting is not authorized and the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 1.13 voting of shares . a shareholder may vote at any meeting of shareholders of this corporation, either in person or by proxy. shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by the officer, agent or proxy designated by the bylaws of the corporate shareholder or, in the absence of any applicable bylaw, by such person as the board of directors of the corporate shareholder may designate. proof of such designation may be made by presentation of a certified copy of the bylaws or other instrument of the corporate shareholder. in the absence of any such designation or, in the case of conflicting designation by the corporate shareholder, the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary and the treasurer of the corporate shareholder shall be presumed to possess, in that order, authority to vote such shares. 3 shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, personal representative or conservator may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his or her name. shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him or her without a transfer of such shares into his or her name or the name of his or her nominee. shares held by or under the control of a receiver, a trustee in a bankruptcy proceeding or an assignee for the benefit of creditors may be voted by such person without the transfer thereof into his or her name. if shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship with respect to the same shares, unless the secretary of this corporation is given notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, then acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one votes, in person or by proxy, that act binds all; (b) if more than one votes, in person or by proxy, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one votes, in person or by proxy, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction is entitled to vote the share or shares in question proportionally; or (d) if the instrument or order so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interest, a majority or a vote evenly split for purposes hereof shall be a majority or a vote evenly split in interest. the principles of this paragraph shall apply, insofar as possible, to execution of proxies, waivers, consents, or objections and for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of a quorum. 1.14 proxies . any shareholder of this corporation, other person entitled to vote on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to the act, or attorney-in-fact for such persons, may vote the shareholder&#146;s shares in person or by proxy. any shareholder of this corporation may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment form, either personally or by an attorney-in-fact. an executed telegram or cablegram appearing to have been transmitted by such person, or a photographic, photostatic, or equivalent reproduction of an appointment form, shall be deemed a sufficient appointment form. an appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary of this corporation or such other officer or agent which is authorized to tabulate votes, and shall be valid for up to eleven (11) months, unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. the death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of this corporation to accept the proxy&#146;s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his or her authority under the appointment. an appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. 4 1.15 voting trusts . one or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust and transferring their shares to the trustee. when a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interest in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to this corporation&#146;s principal office. after filing a copy of the list and agreement in this corporation&#146;s principal office, such copies shall be open to inspection by any shareholder of this corporation, subject to the requirements of the act, or to any beneficiary of the trust under the agreement during business hours. the trustee must also deliver a copy of each extension of the voting trust agreement, and a list of beneficial owners under such extended agreement, to this corporation&#146;s principal office. 1.16 shareholders&#146;
