&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; the reporting persons have acquired their shares of the issuer for investment. discovery is a member of an ad hoc committee of holders of unsecured senior notes (as defined in item 6 below).&#160;

notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, discovery, as part of such ad hoc committee, consented to a joint plan of reorganization (the "plan") filed with the united states bankruptcy court by the issuer and certain of its subsidiaries.&#160;

except as set forth above, the reporting persons have no plans or proposals as of the date of this filing that would relate to or would result in: (a) any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the issuer; (b) any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer; (c) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (d) any material change in the operating policies or corporate structure of the issuer; (e) any change in the issuer's charter or by-laws; (f) the shares of the issuer ceasing to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; or (g) causing the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934. &#160; the reporting persons, however, reserve the right, at a later date, to effect one or more of such changes or transactions in the number of shares they may be deemed to beneficially own. &#160;
