("cardinal"), an ohio corporation. cardinal is a national, full- service wholesaler distributing a broad line of pharmaceuticals, surgical and hospital supplies, therapeutic plasma and other specialty pharmaceutical products, health and beauty care products, and other items typically sold by hospitals, retail drug stores, and other health care providers. cardinal's principal executive offices are located at 5555 glendon court, dublin, ohio 43016. each executive officer and each director of cardinal is a citizen of the united states. the name, business address and present principal occupation of each executive officer and director are set forth in annex i to this schedule 13d which is incorporated herein by this reference. during the last five years, to the best of cardinal's knowledge, neither cardinal nor any of its executive officers or directors has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which cardinal or such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or finding any violation with respect to such laws, and which judgment, decree or final order was not subsequently vacated. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to the stock option agreement, dated february 7, 1996, between cardinal and pyxis (the "stock option agreement"), pyxis granted cardinal an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase from pyxis, under certain circumstances and subject to certain adjustments, up to 7,275,861 authorized and unissued shares of pyxis common stock, at a price per share, payable in cash, equal to the lower of (x) $24.80 or (y) the exchange ratio under the agreement and plan of merger, dated february 7, 1996, among cardinal, aztec merger corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of cardinal ("subcorp"), and pyxis (the "merger agreement"), described under item 4 below, multiplied by the closing price of common shares, without par value ("cardinal common shares"), of cardinal as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape on the last trading day page 3 of 11 cusip no. 747251106 immediately preceding the date of delivery to pyxis of written notice of cardinal's exercise of the option. as of the date hereof, the option is not exercisable. the shares of pyxis common stock subject to the option would equal 19.9% of the outstanding pyxis common stock before giving effect to the exercise of the option. under certain circumstances, cardinal may require pyxis to, or pyxis may be permitted to, repurchase for cash the option and any shares of pyxis common stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the option. the option was granted by pyxis as a condition of and in consideration for cardinal entering into the merger agreement. the exercise of the option for the full number of shares currently covered thereby would require aggregate funds of $170,088,003, based on an exchange ratio of .406557 and a closing price for cardinal common share of $57.50 on february 9, 1996. it is anticipated that, should the option become exercisable and should cardinal determine to exercise the option, cardinal would obtain the funds for purchase from working capital or by borrowing from parties whose identity is not yet known. a copy of the stock option agreement is included as exhibit 2.2 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. item 4. purpose of transaction. in connection with the execution of the stock option agreement, cardinal and pyxis entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which, among other matters and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, subcorp will merge (the "merger") with and into pyxis. the option was granted by pyxis as a condition of and in consideration for cardinal entering into the merger agreement. consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including: (i) receipt of the approval of the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of pyxis common stock; (ii) receipt of the approval of issuance of the cardinal common shares to be issued in the merger and of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares; (iii) expiration or termination of all waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under the hart-scott- rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended; (iv) registration of the cardinal common shares to be issued in the merger under the securities act of 1933, as amended; (v) receipt of an opinion of counsel as to the tax-free nature of certain aspects of the merger; (vi) receipt of an accountant's letter confirming that the merger will qualify as a pooling of interests transaction for financial reporting purposes; and (vii) satisfaction of certain other conditions. pursuant to the merger agreement, (a) the officers of the surviving corporation in the page 4 of 11 cusip no. 747251106 merger will be the officers of pyxis, (b) the directors of the surviving corporation in the merger will be the directors of subcorp, (c) each share of pyxis common stock will be converted into .406557 of a cardinal common share, subject to adjustment under the circumstances described in the merger agreement, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (d) at the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of pyxis, as the surviving corporation, will be amended to be identical (save for the name of the corporation) to those of subcorp. upon consummation of the merger, the pyxis common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market. a copy of the merger agreement is included as exhibit 2.1 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. except as set forth herein, cardinal does not have any current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional shares of pyxis common stock or the disposition of shares of pyxis common stock; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving pyxis or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of any material amount of assets of pyxis or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the present board of directors or management of pyxis, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any vacancies on the board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of pyxis; (vi) any other material change in pyxis's business or corporate structure; (vii) any change in pyxis's charter or bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto, or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of pyxis by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of pyxis to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (ix) a class of equity securities of pyxis becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of issuer. although the option does not allow cardinal to purchase any shares of pyxis common stock pursuant thereto unless and until the conditions to exercise specified in the stock option agreement occur, assuming for purposes of this item 5 that such conditions are satisfied and cardinal is entitled to purchase shares of pyxis common stock pursuant to the option, cardinal would be entitled to purchase 7,275,861 shares of pyxis common stock, or approximately 16.6% of the outstanding pyxis common stock after giving effect to the exercise of the option. page 5 of 11 cusip no. 747251106 cardinal does not currently have the right to acquire any shares of pyxis common stock under the option unless certain events specified in the stock option agreement occur. accordingly, cardinal does not have sole or shared voting or dispositive power with respect to any shares of pyxis common stock, and cardinal disclaims beneficial ownership of pyxis common stock subject to the option until such events occur. assuming for purposes of this item 5 that events occurred that would enable cardinal to exercise the option and cardinal exercised the option, cardinal would have sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the shares acquired pursuant to the option, subject to pyxis's right to repurchase such shares as set forth in the stock option agreement. the foregoing description of certain terms of the stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the stock option agreement which is filed as exhibit 2.2 hereto and which is incorporated herein by this reference. to the best of cardinal's knowledge, no executive officer or director of cardinal beneficially owns any shares of pyxis common stock, nor (except for the issuance of the option) have any transactions in pyxis common stock been effected during the past 60 days by cardinal or, to the best knowledge of cardinal, by any executive officer or director of cardinal. in addition, no other person is known by cardinal to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities covered by this schedule 13d. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. each of the persons set forth in annex ii to this schedule 13d, which annex ii is incorporated herein by this reference, has entered into an agreement with cardinal pursuant to which, among other matters, such person has agreed (i) to vote all of the shares of pyxis common stock beneficially owned by such person or its affiliates or over which such person or any of its affiliates has voting power or control to approve the merger and the merger agreement, (ii) not to vote such shares in favor of any other recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving pyxis, or acquisition of any capital stock (other than upon exercise of outstanding options under stock option plans of pyxis in effect on february 7, 1996) or any material portion of the assets (except for acquisitions of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) of pyxis and (iii) not to, and not to permit any company, trust or other entity controlled by such person to, and not to permit any of its affiliates to, contract to sell, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of such shares or any interest therein or securities convertible thereinto or any voting rights with respect thereto other than pursuant to the merger without cardinal's consent. such persons in the aggregate are estimated to have page 6 of 11 cusip no. 747251106 voting power over approximately 4% of the outstanding shares of pyxis common stock, based upon 36,562,117 shares of pyxis common stock outstanding as of february 5, 1996, as represented by pyxis. cardinal may hereafter enter into similar agreements with other holders of pyxis common stock. a copy of the form of support/voting agreement, dated as of february 7, 1996, executed by such persons is included as exhibit 99.1 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the support/voting agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. a copy of the merger agreement is included as exhibit 2.1 to

1996, by and among cardinal health, inc., an ohio corporation ("cardinal"), aztec merger corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of cardinal ("subcorp"), and pyxis corporation, a delaware corporation ("pyxis"). preliminary statements a. cardinal desires to acquire the healthcare auto- mation and information business and other businesses operated by pyxis through the merger (the "merger") of subcorp with and into pyxis, with pyxis as the surviving corporation, pursuant to which each share of pyxis common stock (as defined in sec- tion 4.4) outstanding at the effective time (as defined in sec- tion 1.2) will be converted into the right to receive cardinal common shares (as defined in section 3.3) as more fully pro- vided herein. b. pyxis desires to combine its healthcare automa- tion and information and other businesses with the wholesale drug distribution and related businesses operated by cardinal and for the holders of shares of pyxis common stock ("pyxis stockholders") to have a continuing equity interest in the com- bined cardinal/pyxis businesses. c. the parties intend that the merger constitute a tax-free "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), by reason of section 368(a)(2)(e) thereof. d. the parties intend that the merger be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests for financial reporting purposes. e. the respective boards of directors of cardinal, subcorp and pyxis have determined the merger in the manner con- templated herein to be desirable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders and, by resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this agreement. agreement now, therefore, in consideration of these premises and the mutual and dependent promises hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i the merger 1.1 the merger. upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), subcorp shall be merged with and into pyxis as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in article vi. following the merger, the separate corporate existence of subcorp shall cease and pyxis shall continue its existence un- der the laws of the state of delaware. pyxis, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the merger, is hereinafter some- times referred to as the "surviving corporation." 1.2 effective time. the merger shall be consummated by filing with the secretary of state of the state of delaware (the "delaware secretary of state") a certificate of merger (the "certificate of merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with section 251(c) of the dgcl. the merger shall become effective (the "effective time") when the certificate of merger has been filed with the delaware sec- retary of state or at such later time as shall be specified in the certificate of merger. prior to the filing referred to in this section 1.2, a closing (the "closing") shall be held at the offices of cardinal, 5555 glendon court, dublin, ohio 43016, or such other place as the parties may agree on a date (the "closing date") specified by the parties, which date shall be as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten business days, following the date upon which all conditions set forth in article vi hereof have been satisfied or waived or such other time as the parties may mutually agree. 1.3 effects of the merger. the merger shall have the effects set forth in section 259 of the dgcl. 1.4 certificate of incorporation and bylaws. the certificate of merger shall provide that at the effective time (i) the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corpora- tion as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be amended as of the effective time so as to contain the provi- sions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior thereto in the certificate of incorporation of subcorp, except for article i thereof which shall continue to read "the name of the corporation is 'pyxis corporation'", and (ii) the by-laws of pyxis in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the by-laws of the surviving corporation, amended as of the effective time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained in the bylaws of subcorp immediately -2- prior thereto; in each case until amended in accordance with applicable law. 1.5 directors and officers. from and after the ef- fective time, the officers of pyxis shall be the officers of the surviving corporation and the directors of subcorp shall be the directors of the surviving corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. on or prior to the closing date, pyxis shall deliver to cardinal evidence satisfactory to cardinal of the resignations of the directors of pyxis, such resignations to be effective as of the effective time. 1.6 additional actions. if, at any time after the effective time, the surviving corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the surviving corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of pyxis, or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this agreement, pyxis and its of- ficers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the surviving corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to ex- ecute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the surviving corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this agreement, and the officers and directors of the surviving corporation are authorized in the name of pyxis or otherwise to take any and all such action. article ii conversion of securities 2.1 conversion of capital stock. at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of cardinal, subcorp or pyxis: (a) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of subcorp issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the surviving corporation. such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the surviv- ing corporation. -3- (b) each share of pyxis common stock issued and out- standing immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and represent a number of cardinal common shares equal to the exchange ratio (as defined below). (c) each share of capital stock of pyxis held in the treasury of pyxis shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 2.2 exchange ratio; fractional shares. the "ex- change ratio" shall equal (i) if cardinal has not made an ad- justment election (as defined in section 7.1(d)), .406557 or (ii) if cardinal has made an adjustment election, then the product of (x) .406557 and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing 55.34 by the average of the closing prices of cardinal common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") composite tape ("nyse composite tape") on each of the last ten trading days ending on the sixth trading day prior to the earlier of (i) the meeting of pyxis stockholders at which the vote to approve the merger occurs or (ii) the meeting of holders of cardinal common shares ("cardinal shareholders") at which the vote to approve and authorize the issuance of cardinal common shares in the merger occurs (the "average share price"). no certificates for fractional cardinal common shares shall be issued as a result of the conversion provided for in section 2.1(b). to the extent that an outstanding share of pyxis common stock would otherwise have become a fractional cardinal common share, the holder thereof, upon presentation of such fractional interest represented by an appropriate certifi- cate for pyxis common stock to the exchange agent pursuant to section 2.3, shall be entitled to receive a cash payment therefor in an amount equal to the value (determined with reference to the closing price of cardinal common shares on the nyse composite tape on the last full trading day immediately prior to the effective time) of such fractional interest. such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a separately bargained for, consideration. if more than one certificate representing shares of pyxis common stock shall be surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of cardinal common shares for which certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by the certificates so surrendered. in the event that prior to the effective time cardinal shall declare a stock dividend or other distribution payable in cardinal common shares or securities convertible into cardinal common shares, or effect a stock split, reclassification, combination or other change with respect to cardinal common shares, the exchange ratio set forth in this section 2.2 shall be adjusted to -4- reflect such dividend, distribution, stock split, reclassification, combination or other change. 2.3 exchange of certificates. (a) exchange agent. promptly following the effec- tive time, cardinal shall deposit with boatmen's trust company or such other exchange agent as may be designated by cardinal (the "exchange agent"), for the benefit of pyxis stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this section 2.3, certificates representing cardinal common shares issuable pursuant to section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of pyxis common stock and shall from time-to-time deposit cash in an amount reasonably expected to be paid pursuant to section 2.2 (such cardinal common shares and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "exchange fund"). (b) exchange procedures. as soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "cer- tificates") which immediately prior to the effective time rep- resented outstanding shares of pyxis common stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive cardinal common shares pursuant to section 2.1(b) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as cardinal may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing cardinal common shares. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent, together with a duly ex- ecuted letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a cer- tificate representing that number of cardinal common shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to section 2.1 and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distribu- tions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pur- suant to the provisions of this article ii, after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and the shares represented by the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. no interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distribu- tions, if any, payable to holders of shares of pyxis common stock. in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of pyxis common stock which is not registered on the transfer records of pyxis, a certificate representing the proper number of cardinal common shares, together with a check for the cash -5- to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to such transferee if the certificate representing such shares of pyxis common stock held by such transferee is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents required to evi- dence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any appli- cable stock transfer taxes have been paid. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.3, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing cardinal common shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as pro- vided in this article ii. (c) distributions with respect to unexchanged shares. notwithstanding any other provisions of this agree- ment, no dividends or other distributions declared or made af- ter the effective time with respect to cardinal common shares having a record date after the effective time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate, and no cash pay- ment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder shall surrender such certificate as provided in this section 2.3. subject to the effect of appli- cable laws (as defined in section 3.9), following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole cardinal common shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time theretofore payable with respect to such whole cardinal common shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole cardinal common shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon. (d) no further ownership rights in pyxis common stock. all cardinal common shares issued upon surrender of certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to this article ii) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of pyxis common stock represented thereby, and from and after the effective time there shall be no further regis- tration of transfers on the stock transfer books of pyxis of shares of pyxis common stock. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this section 2.3. certificates surrendered for exchange by any -6- person constituting an "affiliate" of pyxis for purposes of rule 145(c) under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), shall not be exchanged until cardinal has received written undertakings from such person in the form at- tached hereto as exhibit a. (e) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to pyxis stock- holders for six months after the effective time shall be deliv- ered to cardinal, upon demand thereby, and holders of shares of pyxis common stock who have not theretofore complied with this section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to cardinal for payment of any claim to cardinal common shares, cash in lieu of frac- tional shares thereof, or dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof. (f) no liability. none of cardinal, the surviving corporation or the exchange agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of pyxis common stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the exchange fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. if any certifi- cates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years af- ter the effective time of the merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any cash in lieu of frac- tional shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to whole shares of pyxis common stock in respect of such certifi- cate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental authority (as defined in section 3.4)), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law (as defined in section 3.9), become the property of cardinal, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (g) investment of exchange fund. the exchange agent shall invest any cash included in the exchange fund, as di- rected by cardinal, on a daily basis. any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to cardinal upon termination of the exchange fund pursuant to section 2.3(e). 2.4 treatment of stock options; stock purchase plan. (a) prior to the effective time, cardinal and pyxis shall take all such actions as may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised option under stock option plans of pyxis in effect on the date hereof which has been granted to current or former directors, officers, employees, consultants or independent contractors of pyxis by pyxis (each, an "pyxis -7- option") to be automatically converted at the effective time into an option (a "cardinal exchange option") to purchase that number of cardinal common shares equal to the number of shares of pyxis common stock issuable immediately prior to the effec- tive time upon exercise of the pyxis option (without regard to actual restrictions on exercisability) multiplied by the ex- change ratio, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price which existed under the corresponding pyxis option di- vided by the exchange ratio, and with other terms and condi- tions that are the same as the terms and conditions of such pyxis option immediately before the effective time; provided that with respect to any pyxis option that is an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of section 422 of the code, the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner sat- isfying the requirements of section 424(a) of the code. in connection with the issuance of cardinal exchange options, cardinal shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of cardinal common shares that will become subject to cardinal exchange op- tions pursuant to this section 2.4 and (ii) from and after the effective time, upon exercise of cardinal exchange options, make available for issuance all cardinal common shares covered thereby, subject to the terms and conditions applicable thereto. (b) pyxis agrees to issue treasury shares of pyxis, to the extent available, upon the exercise of pyxis options prior to the effective time. (c) cardinal agrees to file with the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") as soon as reasonably practicable after the closing date a registration statement on form s-8 or other appropriate form under the securities act to register cardinal common shares issuable upon exercise of the cardinal exchange options and use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the exercise or expiration of such options. (d) pyxis shall terminate the pyxis employee stock purchase plan (the "pyxis purchase plan") immediately prior to the effective time. unless cardinal and pyxis shall otherwise agree in writing prior to the effective time, all amounts that have been withheld but not yet applied to purchase pyxis common stock pursuant to the pyxis purchase plan as of the termination date shall be refunded, without interest, pursuant to the terms of the pyxis purchase plan. -8- article iii representations and warranties of cardinal and subcorp in order to induce pyxis to enter into this agree- ment, cardinal and

(b) as used herein, a "purchase event" shall mean any of the following events: (i) any person (other than cardinal or any of its subsidiaries) shall have commenced (as such term is defined in rule 14d-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")), or shall have filed a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any shares of pyxis common stock such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the then outstanding pyxis common stock; (ii) pyxis or any of its subsidiaries shall or shall have entered into, authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced an intention to enter into, authorize, recommend, or propose, an agreement, -2- arrangement or understanding with any person (other than cardinal or any of its subsidiaries) to, or any person (other than cardinal or any of its subsidiaries) shall have publicly announced a bona fide intention to, (a) effect any competing transaction, (b) purchase, lease or otherwise acquire 10% or more of the assets of pyxis or any of its subsidiaries or (c) purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, tender or exchange offer or similar transaction) benefi- cial ownership (as defined below) of securities repre- senting 10% or more of the voting power of pyxis or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any person (other than cardinal or any subsidiary of cardinal) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of pyxis; (iv) pyxis's board of directors shall have with- drawn or modified in a manner adverse to cardinal the recommendation of pyxis's board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and/or the merger; (v) if at the meeting of pyxis stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) the requisite vote of the pyxis stockholders to approve the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement shall not have been obtained; or (vi) the merger agreement shall have been terminated by either party pursuant to section 7.1 thereof (other than a termination pursuant to sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c) (other than a termination by cardinal pursuant to section 7.1(c) of the merger agreement if pyxis's or pyxis's affiliate's failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before june 30, 1996), 7.1(d), 7.1(g) or 7.1(i)) or any event shall have occurred that would cause any party thereto to have the right to so terminate the merger agreement. (c) as used herein, the terms "beneficial owner- ship", "beneficial owner" and "beneficially own" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in rule 13d-3 under the ex- change act. as used herein, "person" shall have the meaning specified in sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the exchange act. -3- (d) in the event cardinal wishes to exercise the option, it shall deliver to pyxis a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it intends to pur- chase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than two business days nor later than 60 calendar days from the notice date for the closing of such purchase (the "closing date"); provided that if the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the option (the "closing") cannot be consummated by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has expired or been terminated; and, provided further that, without limiting the foregoing, if prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is required in connection with such purchase, cardinal and, if applicable, pyxis shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same (and pyxis shall cooperate with cardinal in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval), and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the case may be, (i) any required notification period has expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been obtained, and in either event, any requisite waiting period has passed.

(c) if at the time of issuance of any pyxis common stock pursuant to any exercise of the option, pyxis shall have issued any share purchase rights or similar securities to holders of pyxis common stock, then each such share of pyxis common stock shall also represent rights with terms substantially the same as and at least as favorable to cardinal as those issued to other holders of pyxis common stock. (d) certificates for pyxis common stock delivered at any closing hereunder shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows: the shares represented by this certificate are subject to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and pyxis corporation, a copy of which is on file at the principal office of pyxis corporation, and to resale restrictions arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state securities laws. a copy of such agreement will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by pyxis corporation of a written request therefor. it is understood and agreed that the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if cardinal shall have delivered to pyxis an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to pyxis to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act and any applicable state securities laws. 5. authorization, etc. (a) pyxis hereby represents and warrants to cardinal that: -5- (i) pyxis has full corporate authority to execute and deliver this option agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) such execution, delivery and consummation have been authorized by the board of directors of pyxis, and no other corporate proceedings are necessary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of pyxis, enforceable against pyxis in accordance with its terms; (iv) pyxis has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and permit it to issue and, at all times from the date hereof through the date of the exercise in full or the expiration or termination of the option, shall have reserved for issuance upon exercise of the option, 7,275,861 shares of pyxis common stock, all of which, upon issuance pursuant hereto, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances, restrictions and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights; and (v) the rights agreement dated as of august 5, 1994, between pyxis and first interstate bank (the "rights agreement"), has been amended, and will remain amended (and no replacement plan will be adopted), so as to provide that none of cardinal and its affiliates will become an "acquiring person" and that no "stock acquisition date" or "distribution date" (as such terms are defined in the rights agreement) will occur as a result of the execution of this option agreement, the grant of the option hereunder or the acquisition or transfer of shares of pyxis common stock by cardinal pursuant to the exercise, in whole or in part, of the option. (b) pyxis hereby agrees that, prior to the termination of the option pursuant to section 3(a) hereof, pyxis shall not take, or allow to be taken, any action that could result in the representations and warranties set forth in section 5(a)(v) hereof becoming false or inaccurate. (c) cardinal hereby represents and warrants to pyxis that: -6- (i) cardinal has full corporate authority to ex- ecute and deliver this option agreement and to consum- mate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) such execution, delivery and consummation have been authorized by all requisite corporate action by cardinal, and no other corporate proceedings are neces- sary therefor; (iii) this option agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of cardinal, enforceable against cardinal in accordance with its terms; and (iv) any pyxis common stock or other securities ac- quired by cardinal upon exercise of the option will not be taken with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of ex- cept in compliance with the securities act. 6. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. (a) in the event of any change in pyxis common stock by reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, and the purchase price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that cardinal shall receive upon exercise of the option the same class and number of outstanding shares or other securities or property that cardinal would have received in respect of pyxis common stock if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. if any additional shares of pyxis common stock are issued after the date of this option agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in the first sentence of this section 6(a) or pursuant to this option agreement) the number of shares of pyxis common stock subject to the option shall be adjusted so that, after such issuance, it equals 19.9% of the number of shares of pyxis common stock then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the option. (b) in the event that pyxis shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than cardinal or one of its subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than cardinal or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into pyxis -7- and pyxis shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of pyxis common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of pyxis or any other person or cash or any other property or the shares of pyxis common stock outstanding immediately before such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding common shares and common share equivalents of pyxis, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than cardinal or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option, at the election of cardinal, with respect to any of the following persons (as designated by cardinal) (i) the acquiring corporation (as defined below), (ii) any person that controls the acquiring corporation, or (iii) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), pyxis.

(a) at the request of cardinal at any time commencing upon the occurrence of a purchase event and ending 13 months immediately thereafter (the "cardinal repurchase period"), pyxis (or any successor entity thereof) shall repurchase the option from cardinal together with all (but not less than all) shares of pyxis common stock purchased by cardinal pursuant thereto with respect to which cardinal then has beneficial ownership, at a price (when calculated on a per share basis, the "per share repurchase price") equal to the sum of: (i) the difference between (a) the "market/tender offer price" for shares of pyxis common stock (defined as the higher of (x) the highest price per share at which a tender or exchange offer has been made for shares of pyxis common stock or (y) the highest closing mean of the "bid" and the "ask" price per share of pyxis -8- common stock reported by the nasdaq national market, the automated quotation system of the national association of securities dealers, inc., for any day within that portion of the cardinal repurchase period which precedes the date cardinal gives notice of the required repurchase under this section 7) and (b) the exercise price as determined pursuant to section 2 hereof (subject to adjustment as provided in section 6), mul- tiplied by the number of shares of pyxis common stock with respect to which the option has not been exercised, but only if such market/tender offer price is greater than such exercise price; (ii) the exercise price paid by cardinal for any shares of pyxis common stock acquired pursuant to the option; (iii) the difference between the market/tender offer price and the exercise price paid by cardinal for any shares of pyxis common stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the option, multiplied by the number of shares so purchased, but only if such market/tender offer price is greater than such exercise price; and (iv) cardinal's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with pursuing the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, without limitation, legal, accounting and investment banking fees, up to but not in excess of an amount equal to $2 million in the aggregate, less any amounts previously paid by pyxis to cardinal solely in reimbursement for costs pursuant to section 7.2 of the merger agreement. (b) in the event cardinal exercises its rights un- der this section 7, pyxis shall, within 10 business days thereafter, pay the required amount to cardinal by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by cardinal and cardinal shall surrender to pyxis the option and the certificates evidencing the shares of pyxis common stock purchased thereunder with respect to which cardinal then has beneficial ownership. (c) in determining the market/tender offer price, the value of any consideration other than cash shall be de- termined by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by cardinal and reasonably acceptable to pyxis. -9- 8. repurchase at option of pyxis except to the extent that cardinal shall have previously exercised its rights under section 7, at the re- quest of pyxis during the six-month period commencing 13 months following the first occurrence of a purchase event, pyxis may repurchase from cardinal, and cardinal shall sell to pyxis, all (but not less than all) of the pyxis common stock acquired by cardinal pursuant to the option and with respect to which cardinal has beneficial ownership at the time of such repurchase at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) 110% of the market/tender offer price per share (calculated in the manner set forth in section 7(a)(i) hereof but utilizing the period beginning on the occurrence of a purchase event and ending on the date pyxis exercises its repurchase right pursuant to this section 8), (ii) the per share repurchase price or (iii) the sum of (a) the aggregate purchase price of the shares so repurchased plus (b) interest on the aggregate purchase price paid for the shares so repurchased from the date of purchase by cardinal to the date of repurchase at the highest rate of interest an- nounced by bank one, columbus, na as its prime or base lending or reference rate during such period, less any dividends received on the shares so repurchased, plus (c) cardinal's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with pursuing the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, without limitation, legal, accounting and investment banking fees, less any amounts previously paid by pyxis to cardinal solely in reimbursement for costs pursuant to section 7.2(i) of the merger agreement, which sum shall be divided by the number of shares of pyxis common stock to be repurchased by pyxis. any repurchase under this section 8 shall be consummated in accordance with section 7(b). 9. registration rights. at any time after a purchase event, pyxis shall, if requested by any holder or beneficial owner of shares of pyxis common stock issued upon exercise of the option (each a "holder"), as expeditiously as possible file a registration statement on a form for general use under the securities act if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of pyxis common stock that have been acquired upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition requested by any such holder. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by pyxis for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. pyxis shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement -10- first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other disposi- tions. the registration effected under this section 9 shall be at pyxis's expense except for underwriting commissions and the fees and disbursements of such holders' counsel at- tributable to the registration of such pyxis common stock. in no event shall pyxis be required to effect more than two registrations hereunder. the filing of any registration statement required hereunder may be delayed for such period of time (not to exceed 60 days) as may reasonably be required to facilitate any public distribution by pyxis of pyxis common stock or if a special audit of pyxis would otherwise be required in connection therewith. if requested by any such holder in connection with such registration, pyxis shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares on terms and including obligations and indemnities which are customary for parties similarly situated. upon receiving any request for registration under this section 9 from any holder, pyxis agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to pyxis to be entitled to registration rights under this section 9, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. 10. listing. if pyxis common stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option are then listed on the nasdaq national market or any national securities exchange, pyxis, upon the request of cardinal, will promptly file an application to list the shares of pyxis common stock or other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option on the nasdaq national market or such exchange and will use its best efforts to obtain approval of such listings as soon as practicable. 11. severability. any term, provision, covenant or restriction con- tained in this option agreement held by a court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, voidness or unenforceability, but neither the remaining terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this option agreement nor the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction shall be affected or impaired thereby. any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this option agreement -11- that is so found to be so broad as to be unenforceable shall be interpreted to be as broad as is enforceable. 12. miscellaneous. (a) expenses. each of the parties hereto shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, in- cluding fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel, except as other- wise provided herein.

(c) successors; no third party beneficiaries. the terms and conditions of this option agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. nothing in this option agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns, any rights, reme- dies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this option agreement, except as expressly provided herein.
