and (ii) second, from the registrable shares requested to be included in such registration by the holders (allocated, if necessary, -7- pro rata among all such holders on the basis of the relative numbers of shares each such person has requested to be included in such registration), it being understood and agreed that the securities referred to in clause (i) above shall not be included in any such offering unless or until all the registrable shares requested to be included in such offering by the holders are so included. section 2.07. right of the company to suspend registration. the company shall be entitled to suspend, for a reasonable period of time not in excess of ninety days after its receipt of a request for a demand registration pursuant to section 2.02, the filing of any registration statement which it otherwise would be required to file pursuant to this article 2, if (i) at any time prior to the filing of such registration statement (a) the company is engaged or has fixed plans to engage in a registered public offering of its securities, (b) the company is in possession of material nonpublic information not ripe for disclosure in a registration statement and the board of directors of the company determines, in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment, that the disclosure of such information would be materially detrimental to the business and affairs of the company and that any registration statement absent the inclusion of such information would be materially misleading, (c) the company is then prohibited (pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement in connection with a public offering of its securities or otherwise) from filing such registration statement or (d) the company is engaged in any other activity which, in the good faith determination of the board of directors of the company, would be adversely affected by the requested demand registration to the material detriment of the company (each, a "disadvantageous effect"); and (ii) the company gives all selling holders written notice of such suspension; provided, however, that a suspension pursuant to this section 2.07 or pursuant to section 4.02 by reason of the existence of one or more disadvantageous effects shall be authorized only once during any twelve-month period. in the event of any suspension pursuant to this section 2.07, then unless the request for the demand registration is withdrawn pursuant to the last sentence of this section 2.07, the company shall file such registration statement as soon as practicable after the first to occur of (w) the consummation of the transaction which is the asserted basis for such disadvantageous effect, (x) the abandonment or termination of such transaction prior to consummation, (y) the determination by the board of directors of the company that such filing would not or would no longer result in such disadvantageous effect and (z) the ninety-first day after the receipt of the applicable request for such demand registration. if the company shall suspend the filing of any registration statement pursuant to this section 2.07, the majority selling holders shall have the right to withdraw the request for such demand registration by giving written notice to the company prior to expiration of such suspension period. section 2.08. form of registration statement. if, in connection with a demand registration, the company proposes to effect such registration through the filing of a registration statement on a particular registration form available for such registration under -8- the 1933 act and either the underwriters or managing underwriter, selling or placement agent or managing selling or placement agent or syndicate manager, if any, in connection with such demand registration shall advise the company in writing of its or their reasonable and good faith opinion that the use of another available form is of material importance to the success of the proposed offering or sale or other distribution contemplated, then such demand registration shall be effected on such other form. section 2.09. no other participants in demand registration. unless otherwise agreed by the majority holders, neither the company nor any other person except holders shall be permitted to include any shares of common stock, rights or other securities for registration, offering, sale or distribution in any demand registration. section 2.10. shelf registration.

(ii) any relief other than the payment of money is sought against the indemnified party; (iii) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;

or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other, from the subject offering or distribution, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by (or omitted to be supplied by) the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one -24- hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the net proceeds of the offering or other distribution received by the indemnifying party bears to the net proceeds of the offering or other distribution received by the indemnified party. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 6.04 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if all holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 6.04. section 6.05. limit on liability of holders. the parties agree, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that the obligations and liability of each selling holder with respect to any demand registration or piggyback registration, whether for indemnification pursuant to section 6.02, contribution pursuant to section 6.04 or otherwise, shall not in any event exceed in the aggregate the amount of net proceeds received by such selling holder from the sale of the registrable shares sold by such selling holder in such demand registration or piggyback registration. article 7 rule 144 section 7.01. rule 144. the company covenants that it will use best efforts to file any reports required to be filed by it under the 1933 act and the 1934 act and that it will take such further action as holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable holders to sell registrable shares without registration under the 1933 act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the 1933 act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of a holder, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. exhibit b purchaser shares purchase price wc capital, llc.................... 1,552,420 $962,500.40 carnegie hill associates, llc...... 322,580 $199,999.60 exhibit c [intentionally left blank] ex-2 3 0003.txt joint filing agreement joint filing agreement the undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on schedule 13d is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on schedule 13d shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. the undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning it or him contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that it or he knows of or has reason to believe that such information is not accurate. dated: january 22, 2001 wc capital, llc by: /s/ james wood ---------------------------------- name: james wood title: managing principal james wood /s/ james wood ---------------------------------- james wood christopher cox /s/ christopher cox ---------------------------------- christopher cox -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
