(a) if the company receives at any time, a written request from the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding (the "initiating holders") that the company file a registration statement under the act covering the registration of at least fifty percent (50%) of the registrable securities then outstanding, then the company shall: (i) within 10 days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all holders; (ii) use all reasonable efforts to file as soon as practicable, and in any event within 60 days of the receipt of such request, a registration statement for registration under the act of all registrable securities which the holders request to be registered, subject to the limitations of subsection 1.2(b); and (ii) use all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective. (b) if the initiating holders intend to distribute registrable securities by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the company as a part of their request made pursuant to subsection 1.2(a), and the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in subsection 1.2(a). the underwriter will be selected by the initiating holders and shall be an underwriter of regional or national standing reasonably acceptable to the company. in such event, the right of any holder to include registrable securities in the registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in the underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and such holder). all holders proposing to distribute their securities through the underwriting shall (together with the company as provided in subsection 1.4(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 1.2, if the underwriter advises the initiating holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the initiating holders shall so advise all holders of registrable securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant to this subsection, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all holders, including the initiating holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of registrable securities of the company owned by each holder; provided, however, that the number of shares of registrable securities to be included in the underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company furnishes to initiating holders a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the company stating that the company is actively engaged in an offering for itself or others or that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be detrimental to the company for a registration statement to be filed and it is therefore necessary to defer the filing of the registration statement, the company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to the filing for a period of not more than 120 days after receipt of the request of the initiating holders; provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve-month period. (d) in addition, the company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to this section 1.2 (i) after the company has effected one registration pursuant to this section 1.2 and such registration has been declared or ordered effective or (ii) if such demand registration would then be filed within six months of the initial filing of a registration under section 1.9. 1.3 piggyback registration. if the company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the company for any stockholder other than the holders) any of its stock under the act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a registration on form s-4 or form s-8 or successors thereto or on any other form which does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the registrable securities), the company shall, at such time, promptly give each holder written notice of such registration. upon the written request of each holder given within 20 days after mailing of such notice by the company, the company shall, subject to the provisions of section 1.4, cause to be registered under the act all of the registrable securities that each such holder has requested registrable securities to be registered. in the event that the company decides, for any reason, not to complete the registration of shares of common stock other than the registrable securities, or in the event that inclusion of the registrable securities would in the opinion of the managing underwriter for the offering (or the company if there is no underwriter), impair an offering by the company or its stockholders for whom the registration statement is filed, the company shall have no obligation under this section 1.3 to register, or continue with the registration of, the registrable securities. 1.4 obligations of the company. whenever required under this section 1 to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to 120 days or until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been completed, whichever is earlier; provided, however, that the 120-day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the holder is prohibited from selling any securities included in such registration pursuant to section 1.10 hereof or the terms of any lockup agreement entered into at the request of the company or an underwriter. (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement. (c) furnish to the holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of registrable securities owned by them. (d) use reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by the registration statement under other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the holders; provided that the company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions. (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering. (f) notify each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the act or the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. (g) cause all registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed.

and the company will pay to each such holder, underwriter or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action, subject to the limitations of section 1.7(c) below; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by or for any such holder, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter and its officers, and directors, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon written information furnished by or for such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, than an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) the obligations of the company and holders under this section shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this agreement. 1.8 reports

registrable securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public (net of any underwriters' discounts or commissions) of less than $1,000,000; (iii) if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its stockholders for such form s-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which event the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration statement for a period of not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request of the holder or holders under this section 1.9; provided, however, that the company shall not utilize this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period; (iv) if the company has, within the six (6) month period preceding the date of such request, already effected one (1) registration on form s-3 for the
