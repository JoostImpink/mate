or other consideration eqat, a delaware business trust wholly owned by equitable, acquired its shares of the issuer upon the exercise on march 12, 1996 of an option granted in connection with the comprehensive restructuring of the issuer's and its subsidiaries' financial obligations. the option was granted on january 2, 1996 in consideration for the exchange on that date of $28,112,007 principal amount, plus accrued interest, of 11% notes of cafeteria operators, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("cafeteria operators") and indirect wholly-owned partnership subsidiary of the issuer, for a limited partnership interest in cafeteria operators. pursuant to a put agreement, dated as of december 14, 1995, among the issuer, eqat, equitable, and other investors named therein, this option was exercisable by the holders (acting independently) of a majority of the cafeteria operators limited partnership interests received in exchange for the cafeteria operators notes. pursuant to the terms of the put agreement, upon exercise of the option by the required majority (which occurred on march 12, 1996), all investors (including eqat) that had exchanged cafeteria operators notes for cafeteria operators limited partnership interests were deemed to have exercised such option as well. accordingly, on march 12, 1996, eqat's limited partnership interest in cafeteria operators was transferred to the issuer in exchange for the shares. 16 item 4 - purpose of transaction eqat acquired its shares of the issuer reported in this schedule 13d solely for investment purposes in connection with the comprehensive restructuring of the issuer's and its subsidiaries' financial obligations, as further described in item 3 above. eqat currently has no contracts or arrangements concerning disposition of the shares. however, under the exchange agreement, dated as of november 15, 1995, among the issuer, cafeteria operators, eqat, equitable, and other investors named therein, eqat has the right to have its shares registered for resale under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"). on may 3, 1996, the issuer filed a registration statement on form s-1 pursuant to such registration rights on behalf of eqat as well as other holders of the issuer's common stock. the issuer filed amendment no. 1 to this registration statement on june 27, 1996. item 5 - interest in securities of the issuer eqat is holder of record of the 8,499,857 shares reported in this schedule 13d, or approximately 17.46% of the shares outstanding as of june 21, 1996 (percentage of outstanding based on information provided by the issuer in amendment no. 1, filed june 27, 1996, to its registration statement on form s-1). equitable is the beneficiary and owner of eqat. the collateral of eqat, which includes the shares, is managed by alliance pursuant to a collateral management agreement. the shares and such collateral management agreement have been pledged to the chase manhattan bank, n.a. as directed trustee (the "trustee") for the benefit and security of holders of certain notes of eqat. alliance and eqat (through the trustee) share the power to vote and to dispose of the 8,499,857 shares reported in this schedule 13d. equitable, as beneficiary and owner of eqat, may be deemed, for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), to beneficially own indirectly the shares held of record by eqat. because of axa's ownership interest in equitable, and the axa voting trustees' power to vote the equitable shares placed in the axa voting trust, each of axa and the axa voting trustees may be deemed, for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, to beneficially own indirectly the shares that equitable may be deemed to beneficially own indirectly. because of the direct and indirect ownership interest in axa of finaxa and the mutuelles axa, each of finaxa and the mutuelles axa may be deemed, for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, to beneficially own indirectly the shares that axa may be deemed to beneficially own indirectly. axa, finaxa, the mutuelles axa, and the axa voting trustees disclaim beneficial ownership of any shares. the reporting persons, in the aggregate, may be deemed to beneficially own 8,499,857 shares, or approximately 17.46% of the shares outstanding as of june 21, 1996. the percentage of shares outstanding reported as beneficially owned by each person herein on the date hereof is based upon 48,669,340 shares outstanding as of june 21, 1996, as reported by the issuer in amendment no. 1, filed june 27, 1996, to its registration statement on form s-1. item 6 - contracts, arrangements, understandings or
