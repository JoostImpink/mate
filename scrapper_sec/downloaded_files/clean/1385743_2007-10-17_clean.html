however, it is expected that the person to be elected will not be an affiliate of wexford capital or lambda. to permit the issuance of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes and the exercise of the warrants (the " subject securities "), the company is in the process of amending its certificate of incorporation to increase its number of authorized shares of common stock from 40,000,000 shares to 60,000,000 shares (the " certificate amendment"). as a condition to the closing, the company was required to obtain written consents of stockholders of the company sufficient to approve the certificate amendment and the issuance of the subject securities; however, such written consents will not become effective until 20 days after the definitive schedule 14c is given or sent to the company's stockholders. the certificate amendment is expected to become effective on or before the automatic conversion date. as part of the closing, the company entered into a registration rights agreement with the holders of the notes (the " registration rights agreement "), pursuant to which the company agreed to register the subject securities for resale under the securities act of 1933. pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the company is obligated to file a registration statement for such purpose within 60 days after the date on which the definitive schedule 14c is filed and to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective within 180 days after the date on which the definitive schedule 14c is filed. the company is obligated to pay all expenses in connection with such registration. if the company is unable to register all of the subject securities on a single registration statement, the company is obligated to file successive registration statements and cause such registration statements to become effective until all of the subject securities have been registered, all in accordance with the rules of the commission. except as set forth above, none of the reporting persons have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company (other than upon the conversion of the notes or the exercise of the warrants received by the managed account) or the disposition of securities of the company, (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization, or liquidation, involving the company or any of its securities, (iii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) any change in the present board or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company, (vi) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure, (vii) changes in the company's charter, bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person, (viii) causing a class of the securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, (ix) a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the act, or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. however, the reporting persons retain their rights to modify their plans with respect to the transactions described in this item 4, to acquire or dispose of securities of the company and to formulate plans and proposals that could result in the occurrence of any such events, subject to applicable laws and regulations. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) as of october 17, 2007, the managed account is a direct beneficial owner of 375,000 shares of common stock of the company (the " master account shares "), which consists of (i) 250,000 shares of common stock that can be obtained by the managed account upon conversion of the principal amount of the managed account note and (ii) 125,000 shares of common stock that can be obtained by the managed account upon exercise of the warrants that the managed account will receive upon conversion of the principal amount of the managed account note. the managed account shares represent 1.0% of the company's outstanding shares of common stock. as of october 17, 2007, master fund is a direct beneficial owner of 2,887,339 shares of common stock of the company (the " master fund shares " and, together with the managed account shares, the "shares") that can be obtained by master fund upon conversion of the master fund note. the master fund shares represent 7.6% of the company's outstanding shares of common stock. southpaw management serves as the investment manager of the managed account and master fund and receives a performance-based and an asset-based fee for managing the investments of the managed account and master fund; southpaw holdings is the general partner of southpaw management and mr. wyman and mr. golden are principals of southpaw holdings. by reason of such relationships, southpaw management, southpaw holdings, mr. wyman and mr. golden may be deemed to be indirect beneficial owners of the shares. the shares represent 8.6 % of the company's outstanding shares of common stock. the percentages of class specified above (and in the cover pages to this statement) are calculated on the basis of 12,317,992 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as reported in the company's form 10-qsb filed with the commission on august 13, 2007, increased by the aggregate number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the principal amount of all of the notes and (except with regard to the calculation of master fund's percentage of beneficial ownership) the exercise of the warrants that will be received by the managed account as a result of the conversion of the principal amount of the managed account note (i.e., shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants by other holders of series a notes have not been taken into account). the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of all of the notes (as opposed to only the managed account note and the master fund note) have been taken into account notwithstanding rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) promulgated under the act because all of the notes will be converted on the automatic conversion date. if the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes other than the managed account note and the master fund note were not taken into account, the percent of class for the managed account would instead be 2.9%, for master fund would be 19.0% and for each other reporting person would be 20.9%. (b) southpaw management, southpaw holdings, mr. wyman and mr. golden have the power to vote and dispose of the shares. the filing of this statement on schedule 13d shall not be construed as an admission that any of the reporting persons is, for the purposes of section 13(d) or 13(g) of the act, the beneficial owner of any of the shares. pursuant to rule 13d-4, southpaw management, southpaw holdings, mr. wyman and mr. golden disclaim all such beneficial ownership. (c) not applicable. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. pursuant to the investor rights agreement and as further described in item 6 below, the holders of the notes other than lambda have agreed to vote any shares of common stock or other voting securities of the company held by them for the election (or removal if directed by lambda) of two individuals nominated for election to the board by lambda. each of such holders has granted lambda an irrevocable proxy to vote such common stock or voting securities in connection with any vote on such matters. as a result of such rights, the investor rights agreement may be deemed to create a group of which the managed account and master fund are members pursuant to rule 13d-5 promulgated under the act. if a group were to exist, based upon the conversion of the principal amount of the notes the group would beneficially own 34,440,155 shares, representing a percent of class of 73.7%. each of the reporting persons disclaims the existence of a group, and this statement shall not be construed as an admission that a group exists. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer pursuant to the subscription agreement, the company has agreed that at all times until the investor rights agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms (the "designation period "), the company will cause two individuals designated by lambda (the individuals whom lambda has so designated from time to time are referred to herein as the "lambda designees ") to be members of the board except to the extent that (i) lambda otherwise consents in writing, or (ii) a member of the board originally designated by lambda resigns and lambda has not yet designated a successor. without limiting the generality of the company's obligations, during the designation period the company must cause the lambda designees to be elected or nominated to the board, promptly remove any lambda designee from the board upon the written direction of lambda, and promptly elect or appoint any successor designated by lambda having reasonably appropriate business experience and background to fill any vacancy caused by any lambda designee ceasing to be a member of the board for any reason. pursuant to the investor rights agreement, the company has agreed to take such corporate actions as may be required to, among other things, entitle lambda to (i) nominate the lambda designees to the board, (ii) nominate each successor to the lambda designees, provided that any successor shall have reasonably appropriate experience and background, and (iii) direct the removal from the board of any director nominated under the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii). the holders of notes have agreed to vote any shares of common stock or other voting securities of the company held by them for the election (or removal if directed by lambda) of the lambda designees and have granted lambda an irrevocable proxy to vote such common stock or voting securities in connection with any vote on such matters. the investor rights agreement will automatically terminate if lambda no longer owns shares of common stock and securities representing the right to acquire shares of common stock upon conversion, exchange or exercise (including the warrants held by lambda, " equity securities ") that in the aggregate represent at least 10% of the sum of the number of outstanding shares of common stock plus the number of shares of common stock issuable to lambda upon the exercise of equity securities. the parties to the investor rights agreement are the company, lambda, enso global equities master partnership lp, 3v capital master fund, ltd., distressed/high yield trading opportunities, ltd., master fund, kudu partners, l.p., ljhs company, the managed account and lewis p. schneider. the disclosure concerning the registration rights agreement contained in item 4 is incorporated herein by reference. in addition, the subscription agreement, registration rights agreement, the master fund note, the managed account note and form of warrant attached to the managed account note contain customary provisions relating to the transfer of the master fund note, the managed account note and the subject securities. the parties to the registration rights agreement are the same as the parties to the investor rights agreement. except for the subscription agreement, the investor rights agreement, the registration rights agreement, the managed account note and the master fund note, none of the reporting persons are a party to any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the company, including, but not limited to, any agreement concerning (i) transfer or voting of any securities of the company, (ii) finder's fees, (iii) joint venture, (iv) loan or option arrangements, (v) puts or calls, (vi) guarantees of profits, (vii) divisions of profits or losses, or (viii) the
