(b) claims. upon receipt by the stockholder at any time on or before the last day of the indemnification period of a certificate signed by any officer of parent (an "officer's certificate"): (a) stating that parent has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue losses, and (b) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, the stockholder shall, subject to the provisions of section 7.2(c) hereof, deliver to parent, as promptly as practicable, funds in an amount equal to such losses. the stockholder shall, at its sole discretion, pay all claims for indemnification hereunder in (i) cash or (ii) shares of parent common stock; provided, however that all claims for indemnification pursuant to section 7.2(a)(i) (with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of the representations and warranties set forth in section 2.18) or section 7.2(a)(ii) above shall be paid in cash only. in the event the stockholder determines to pay any claim, in whole or in part, in shares of parent common stock, the stockholder shall transfer to parent the number of shares of parent common stock having an aggregate value (based on the valuation of each share at 97% of the parent closing price (adjusted for splits, combinations and the like)) equal to the losses with respect to such claim. (c) objections to claims. no such payment or delivery may be required pursuant to section 7.2(b) above if the stockholder shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the officer's certificate with thirty (30) days of delivery of such officer's certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period. (d) resolution of conflicts. (i) in case the stockholder shall so object in writing to any claim or claims made in any officer's certificate, the stockholder and parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. if the stockholder and parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and stockholder shall deliver to parent, as promptly as practicable, an amount equal to such losses in cash or shares of parent common stock. (ii) if no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior to sixty (60) days after delivery of an officer's certificate, either of parent or the stockholder may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to parent and the stockholder. in the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, parent and the stockholder cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, parent and the stockholder shall each select one arbitrator within ten (10) additional days. the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. if the stockholder does not select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by parent. (iii) any such arbitration shall be held under the expedited rules then in effect of the american arbitration association. the arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without limitation, the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the american arbitration association. the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. the decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such officer's certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this agreement. such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). within five (5) days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party. (iv) judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. (e) third-party claims. in the event parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which parent believes may result in a demand for indemnification, parent shall notify the stockholder of such claim, and the stockholder, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the stockholder, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall alone be determinative of the amount of any claim for indemnification if the settlement is unreasonable. any dispute as to the reasonableness of such settlement shall be resolved pursuant to the terms of section 7.2(d) above. to the extent that such settlement is determined after such dispute resolution to be unreasonable, then the arbitrator(s) shall determine the amount, if any, that stockholder shall be required to indemnify parent in respect of such settled claim. in the event that the stockholder has consented to any such settlement, the stockholder shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this article vii to the amount of any claim by parent for indemnification with respect to such settlement. (f) sole remedy. parent's rights to indemnification as provided for in section 7.2 for a breach of representations or warranties contained in this agreement shall constitute parent's sole remedy for such a breach and the stockholder shall have no other liability or damages to the other party resulting from the breach; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent parent from pursuing remedies, including equitable remedies, as may be available to it under applicable law or equitable principles in the event of the stockholder's failure to comply with its indemnification obligations hereunder or in the event of a claim of fraud by parent against the stockholder. 7.3 further conditions on environmental indemnity.

(c) the stockholder may amend any return of the company, ww or any subsidiary filed or required to be filed for any taxable years or periods ending on or before the closing date, provided that any such amendment shall not adversely affect any of parent, the company, ww or their respective subsidiaries.

(e) neither parent nor the stockholder shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any tax claim which would adversely affect the other party for such year or a subsequent year without the written consent of the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. parent and the stockholder agree to cooperate, and parent agrees to cause the company, ww and any subsidiary to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any tax claim. 9.5 conveyance taxes. the stockholder and parent shall each pay one-half of any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other fees, and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement, other than transfers of assets contemplated by section 5.14 hereof ("transfer taxes"). notwithstanding section 9.2, which shall not apply to returns relating to transfer taxes, any returns that must be filed in connection with transfer taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for filing such returns, and such party will use its reasonable efforts to provide such returns to the other party at least 10 days prior to the due date of such returns. 9.6 miscellaneous (a) except as otherwise required by applicable law, the stockholder and parent agree to treat all payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the company, ww or any subsidiary) under this article ix and under other indemnity provisions of this agreement as adjustments to the purchase price for tax purposes. (b) any tax sharing agreement, arrangement or policy (whether written or oral) between the stockholder and the company, ww or any subsidiary shall be terminated immediately prior to the closing. (c) notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, the obligations of the stockholder to indemnify and hold harmless parent, the company, ww and any subsidiary pursuant to this article ix, and the representations and warranties contained in section 2.8 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). the obligations of parent to indemnify and hold harmless the stockholder pursuant to this article ix shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). (d) resolution of all tax-related disputes. in the event that the stockholder and parent cannot agree on the calculation of any amount relating to taxes or the interpretation or application of any provision of this agreement relating to taxes, such dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreeable to each of the stockholder and parent, whose decision shall be final and binding upon all persons involved and whose expenses shall be shared equally by the stockholder and parent.

(g) for purposes of any tax benefit actually realized determined under section 9.6(f) of this agreement, no later than 90 days after the filing of a tax return for any taxable period that includes a date upon which any amount was paid or accrued by parent, the company, ww or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, or the stockholder or its affiliates, on the other hand (each an "indemnified party"), in respect of a claim for which the stockholder is required to indemnify parent or parent is required to indemnify stockholder, as the case may be, pursuant to this agreement (the "indemnifying party"), parent shall provide stockholder or stockholder shall provide parent, as appropriate, a detailed statement (the "tax benefit statement") specifying the amount, if any, of any tax benefit that was actually realized by the indemnified parties for such tax period. to the extent that any deductions or other tax items (including basis) that could give rise to a tax reduction or savings do not result in the actual realization of such a tax reduction or savings in the year described in the previous sentence, this section 9.6(g) shall apply to each subsequent taxable period of the indemnified parties until either such tax savings are actually realized (resulting in a tax benefit) or the losses or other carryforwards to which such deductions or other tax items (including basis) gave rise expire unused, if applicable. for each relevant taxable period, the indemnifying party shall be provided with full access to the non-proprietary work papers and other materials and information of the indemnified parties' accountants in connection with the review of the tax benefit statement. if the indemnifying party disagrees in any respect with the computation of the amount of the tax benefit actually realized set forth in the tax benefit statement, the indemnifying party may, on or prior to 45 days after the receipt of the tax benefit statement, deliver a notice to the indemnified parties setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the indemnifying party's disagreement therewith ("tax benefit dispute notice"). if no tax benefit dispute notice is received by the indemnified parties on or prior to the 45th day after the indemnifying party's receipt of the tax benefit statement from parent, the tax benefit statement shall be deemed accepted by the indemnifying party. (h) payments. parent shall pay all amounts for indemnification for which it is liable pursuant to this agreement in cash; provided, however, that, if and to the extent any such cash payment (the "excess cash payment") would, in the opinion of skadden, cause skadden to no longer be able to issue an opinion that each of the mergers will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a) of the code, parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pay such excess cash payment in parent common stock (valued in accordance with section 7.2(b)); provided, further, that in no event will parent be obligated to pay such excess cash payment in parent common stock unless, in the opinion of counsel to parent, such payment in parent common stock would be exempt from registration under the securities act. article ix general provisions 10.1 notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial delivery service, or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or sent via facsimile (with acknowledgment of complete transmission) to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice): (i) if to parent, metal merger sub or ww merger sub, to: homestore.com, inc. 225 w. hillcrest drive, suite 100 thousand oaks, ca 91360 attention: david m. rosenblatt, esq. telephone no.: (805) 557-2300 facsimile no.: (805) 557-2689 with a copy to: wilson sonsini goodrich & rosati, professional corporation 650 page mill road palo alto, california 94304 attention: martin w. korman, esq. telephone no.: (650) 493-9300 facsimile no.: (650) 493-6811 and a copy to: fenwick & west two palo alto square palo alto, california 94306 attention: gordon k. davidson, esq. c. kevin kelso, esq. telephone no.: (650) 494-0600 facsimile no.: (650) 494-1417 (ii) if to the company, ww or stockholder, to: cendant corporation 9 west 57th street, 7th floor new york, ny 10019 attention: eric bock, esq. telephone no.: (212) 413-1800 facsimile no.: (212) 413-1923 with a copy to: skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp four times square new york, new york 10036 attention: david fox, esq. telephone no.: (212) 735-3000 facsimile no.: (212) 735-2000 10.2 interpretation.

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and, subject to section 4.1, promptly prepare and file with the sec, and promptly notify the stockholder or the shelf stockholders, as the case may be, of the filing of, such amendments or supplements to any registration statement or prospectus as may be necessary to correct any

rights granted by this agreement are subject to the following additional conditions and limitations: 4.1 delays and suspension. the company may delay the filing of, or suspend or delay the effectiveness of a registration statement for a reasonable period of time (but not exceeding 180 days), if the company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration or offering would interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the company or any of its affiliates or would require premature disclosure thereof and promptly give stockholder or the shelf stockholders, as applicable, written notice of such delay, provided, however, that the company may postpone a filing in such manner only once in each twelve (12) month period; provided that if the company files any other registration statement during this postponement period (other than an excepted registration statement), the company's obligations shall no longer be permitted its rights to delay and suspension under this section 4.1. in such event, the company's obligation under this agreement to file a registration statement, seek effectiveness of a registration statement or keep such registration statement effective shall be deferred. if the company shall postpone the filing of a registration statement pursuant to request for registration pursuant to section 2.1 hereof, stockholder shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the company within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of postponement and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of the requests for registration to which such selling stockholder is entitled pursuant to section 2.1 hereof. if the company suspends the effectiveness of a registration statement, the company will promptly deliver notice to the stockholder or the shelf stockholders, as applicable, of such suspension and will again deliver notice to the stockholder when such suspension is no longer necessary and the duration for which the company is required to keep a registration statement effective shall be extended by an additional number of days equal to the length of any suspension period. 4.2 amended or supplemented prospectus. the stockholder and the shelf stockholders agree that, as a condition to the receipt of the registration rights contained herein, upon receipt of any notice from the company described in section 4.1 hereof that suspends an effective registration statement, such stockholder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable shares until such stockholder's receipt of copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus from the company, or until it is advised in writing by the company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated by reference in the prospectus. if so directed by the company, such stockholder will deliver to the company all copies of the prospectus covering such registrable shares current at the time of receipt of such notice of suspension. 5. indemnification. 5.1 indemnification by the company. the company will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, stockholder and each of the shelf stockholders, as the case may be, and their respective directors, officers, partners, agents and affiliates and each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of the stockholder shares or the shelf shares, as the case may be, and each other person, if any, who controls stockholder or a shelf stockholder, as the case may be, or any such underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 act, insofar as losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which stockholder shares held by stockholder or shelf shares held by the shelf stockholders, as the case may be, were registered under the 1933 act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and the company will reimburse stockholder or the shelf stockholders, as the case may be, and each such director, officer, partner, agent or affiliate, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument executed by or on behalf of stockholder or a shelf stockholder (as the case may be) or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and provided, further, that the company shall not be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of stockholder shares or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 act, in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such person's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of stockholder shares to such person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus so long as such final prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, have been furnished to such underwriter. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of stockholder or the shelf stockholders, as the case may be, or any such underwriter, director, officer, partner, agent or affiliate or controlling person and shall

in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such stockholder. 5.3 notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this section 5 such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 5, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties is reasonably likely to exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be

party notifies the indemnifying party of such indemnified party's judgment and the basis therefor. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into

litigation. 5.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 5 shall be judicially determined (by the entry of final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) to be unavailable to a party seeking indemnification under section 5.1 or 5.2 hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under section 5.1 or section 5.2 hereof, the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under section 5.1 or section 5.2 hereof shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i)

omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)

1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. in addition, no person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 5.5 other indemnification. indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this section 5 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company, on the one hand, and stockholder and each shelf stockholder, on the other hand, with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority other than the 1933 act. 6.

held by it, or the intended method of disposition of such securities as may be required to effect the registration of the registrable securities, the company shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to this agreement with respect to such stockholder shares or shelf shares held by such stockholder or shelf stockholder. 7. expenses of registration. the company shall pay all registration, filing and qualification fees (including sec filing fees and the listing fees of the nasdaq stock market or any stock exchange on which the company securities are traded) attributable to the

thereto), delayed or abandoned, except if such withdrawal, delay or abandonment is a result of: (i) a request by the stockholder or the shelf stockholders to withdraw, delay or abandon such registration; (ii) the failure to comply with the requirements of section 6 hereof by the stockholder or shelf stockholder, as applicable; or (iii) any withdrawal, delay or abandonment of the registration caused by the fraud, material misstatement or omission of a material fact by the stockholder or a shelf stockholder, as applicable, to be included or required to be included in such

however, that such reinstatement shall exist for only so long as the stockholder or such shelf stockholder, as applicable, cannot sell all of the stockholder shares or such shelf stockholder's shares
