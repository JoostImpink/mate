shares of common stock from qad (for a purchase price of $10,500,000) and (b) 444,445 shares of common stock from the trust (for a purchase price of $2,000,000). as additional consideration for

common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share of common stock (the "warrant"), which number of shares of common stock and exercise price are subject to adjustment as provided in the warrant. the funds used to purchase the common stock were obtained, and it is currently anticipated that the funds, if any, used to purchase the securities issuable upon any exercise of the warrant, will be obtained, from the working capital of rei. rei obtains its working capital through capital contributions from its limited partners. 7 page 7 of 14 pages item 4. purpose of transaction. except as described in this schedule 13d, rei entered into the stock purchase agreement and the related agreements described below, and acquired the shares of common stock and the warrant acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement, for investment purposes. rei intends to review from time to time its investment in qad and depending on such review may consider from time to time various alternative courses of action. in addition, depending on prevailing conditions from time to time, including, without limitation, price and availability of shares, future evaluations by rei of the business and prospects of qad, regulatory requirements, other investment opportunities available to rei and general stock market and economic conditions, rei may determine to increase its investment or sell all or part of its investment in qad through open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, rei has no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. the stock purchase agreement contains various covenants relating to qad's ability to take certain actions following the closing, including without limitation; that (i) qad must use the net proceeds from its sale of common stock to rei thereunder for general corporate purposes; (ii) qad must allow rei to have such management rights as may be required to allow rei to qualify as a "venture capital operating company" within the meaning of section 2510.3-101 of the plan asset regulations promulgated by the united states department of labor and (iii) qad (and the other selling parties under the stock purchase agreement) must cause the shares of common stock purchased by rei thereunder to be approved for listing by the nasdaq national market. the stock purchase agreement also provides that qad shall engage rei to provide certain consulting and management advisory services to qad for a term of five years or until rei owns less than 1% of the shares of common stock (on a fully-diluted basis) that rei owns immediately after consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. qad shall pay to rei an annual fee of $312,500 for such services (such fee to be reduced proportionately from and after the time at which rei ceases to hold at least 50% of the shares of common stock (on a fully-diluted basis) that rei owns immediately after consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. the warrant sets forth the terms and conditions on which rei may exercise its right to purchase additional shares of common stock from qad. as noted in item 3 above, the warrant entitles rei to purchase up to 225,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share of common stock, which number of shares of common stock and exercise price are subject to adjustment as provided in the warrant. the warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, commencing on the closing date, through 5:00 p.m., new york time, on december 22, 2003, or, if such day is not a business day, on the next business day. the aggregate exercise price payable upon any exercise of the warrant may be paid, at rei's option, either in cash or on a cashless basis by reducing the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise. under the stockholders' agreement, dated as of the closing date, by and among qad, rei, pamela m. lopker, karl f. lopker and the trust (the "stockholders agreement"), rei and the other parties thereto agreed to take such action as is necessary to nominate and elect an individual designated by rei (the "rei director") as a member of qad's board of directors (the "board") not later than the time of the first meeting of the board, or the first written consent executed by the board, following the closing date, and thereafter at each annual meeting (or special meeting or solicitation for the election of directors) of qad's stockholders. however, rei shall no longer be entitled to designate the rei director if, at any time, rei ceases to hold at least 50% of the shares of common stock (on a fully-diluted basis) that rei owns immediately after consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. if any of pamela m. lopker, karl f. lopker, the trust or their respective permitted affiliate transferees under the stockholders' agreement (collectively, the "lopker stockholders") fails to vote its shares of common stock for the election or removal of the rei director in accordance with the requirements of the stockholders' agreement, rei shall have the right to vote such shares for the election to or removal from the board of the rei director. the stockholders' agreement provides that the rei director shall be jeffery a. lipkin for so long as he shall be 8 page 8 of 14 pages a general partner of rei's general partner and is able and willing to serve as a director of qad. in the event mr. lipkin ceases to be a general partner of rei's general partner or is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve as a director of qad, rei shall use reasonable efforts to designate as the rei director a person (x) as to whom no disclosure would be required to be made at the time of such designation pursuant to rule 401(f) or rule 404 of regulation s-k (other than by reason of the management and closing fees payable to rei pursuant to the stock purchase agreement), (y) who, at the time of such designation, is not an officer, director or affiliate of either (a) a significant customer of qad or (b) a significant competitor of qad and (z) who, prior to the time of such designation, has not engaged in conduct that has resulted in the disqualification of another person from listing on a national securities exchange or nasdaq. in the event that any lopker stockholder proposes to transfer any shares of common stock to any person (other than transfers to permitted affiliate transferees and certain transfers pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended), rei will have certain "tag-along rights" with respect to such transfer. under a registration rights agreement, dated as of the closing date, by and between qad and rei (the "registration rights agreement"), qad has granted to rei certain "demand" and "piggyback" registration rights. under a holdback agreement, dated as of the closing date, by and between rei and the lopker stockholders, the lopker stockholders have agreed to certain limitations on their ability to effect any public sale or distribution of common stock, or any other equity or equity equivalent securities issued by qad, during the 14 days prior to, or during the 90-day period beginning on, the effective date of any "demand" or "piggyback" registration covered by the registration rights agreement in which rei is a selling stockholder. copies of the stock purchase agreement, the warrant, the stockholders' agreement, the registration rights agreement and the holdback agreement are attached hereto as exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, and the foregoing descriptions of each such document are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to such document. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. a. the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each reporting person as of december 23, 1999 is 3,002,778, or approximately 9.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock. the number of shares of common stock, and the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock, beneficially owned by each of rei, rep, mr. finn-egan and mr. lipkin stated above reflects the exercise in full of the warrant. without taking into account the exercise of the warrant and acquisition of the underlying shares of common stock, the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each reporting person as of december 23, 1999 is 2,777,778, or approximately 8.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock. b. the responses of each reporting person to items (7) through (11) of the cover page of

(c) the purchaser shall indemnify the company and the selling stockholders and their respective directors, officers, employees, trustees, beneficiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, the "seller indemnified parties") in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the purchaser contained in this agreement, (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the purchaser contained in this agreement or (iii) violations of applicable securities laws by the purchaser in connection with any resale of the purchased shares or the warrant (other than in connection with a resale pursuant to the registration rights agreement). notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the purchaser shall not have any obligations to a seller indemnified party in respect of a claim for indemnification relating to this section 10.1(c) unless and until the aggregate amount of the seller indemnified parties' losses in respect of all such claims exceeds $125,000, after which the purchaser shall be obligated for all such aggregate losses of the seller indemnified parties in respect of such claims in excess of such amount. 10.2 method of asserting claims. all claims for indemnification by any indemnified party under section 10.1 will be asserted and resolved as follows: (a) in order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under section 10.1 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any person not a party to this agreement against the indemnified party (a "third party claim"), the indemnified party must deliver a claim notice (a "claim notice") to the indemnifying party -27- 29 within 30 business days after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the third party claim; provided, however, that failure to give such claim notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. (b) if a third party claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party, which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. subject to the next succeeding sentence, should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a third party claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, but shall continue to pay for any loss suffered, including expenses of investigations; and if the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such defense and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party. if (i) the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense of a third party claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within 20 business days after the delivery to the indemnifying party of the related claim notice, or (ii) legal counsel for the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that there are or may be legal defenses available to the indemnified party or to other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, which, if the indemnified party and the indemnifying party were to be represented by the same counsel, would constitute a conflict of interest for such counsel or prejudice prosecution of the defenses available to such indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of a third party claim and fail to diligently prosecute such defense, then in each such case the indemnified party, by notice to the indemnifying party, may employ its own counsel and control the defense of the third party claim and the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel employed by the indemnified party; and the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed for any such fees, charges and disbursements, as and when incurred. whether the indemnifying party or the indemnified party controls the defense of any third party claim, the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. such cooperation shall include the retention and provision to the counsel of the controlling party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such third party claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. the indemnifying party shall have the right to settle, compromise or discharge a third party claim (other than any such third party claim in which criminal conduct is alleged) without the indemnified party's consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) constitutes a complete and unconditional discharge and release of the indemnified party, and (ii) provides for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party. any amounts reimbursed to any indemnified party hereunder with respect to a particular third party claim shall be repaid to the indemnifying party in the event that it is finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification by the indemnifying party with respect to such third party claim. -28- 30 (c) in the event any indemnified party shall have a claim under section 10.1 against the indemnifying party that does not involve a third party claim, the indemnified party shall deliver an indemnity notice (an "indemnity notice") with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. the failure by any indemnified party to give the indemnity notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced thereby. if the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does not dispute the claim described in such indemnity notice or fails to notify the indemnified party within the dispute period as to whether the indemnifying party disputes the claim described in such indemnity notice, the loss in the amount specified in the indemnity notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under section 10.1 and, subject to the "basket" provisions of section 10.1, the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such loss to the indemnified party on demand. if the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the resolution period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. (d) the rights accorded to indemnified parties hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any indemnified party may have at law or in equity, under federal and state securities laws, by separate agreement (including under the transaction documents) or otherwise. article xi [intentionally omitted.] article xii miscellaneous 12.1 notices. all notices, requests and other communications hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given only if delivered personally against written receipt or by facsimile transmission or mailed by prepaid first class certified mail, return receipt requested, or mailed by overnight courier prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses or facsimile numbers: (a) if to the purchaser, to: recovery equity investors ii, l.p. 901 mariner's island boulevard suite 555 san mateo, ca 94404 facsimile no.: (650) 578-9842 -29- 31 attn: joseph j. finn-egan jeffrey a. lipkin with a copy to: morgan, lewis & bockius llp 101 park avenue new york, ny 10178 facsimile no.: (212) 309-6273 attn: james a. mercadante, esq.

or (vii) if the registration statement with respect to such demand registration does not remain effective for a period of at least 180 days beyond the effective date thereof or, in the case of any demand registration that constitutes an underwritten offering of registrable securities, until 45 days after the commencement of the distribution by the holders of the registrable securities included in such demand registration, in each case unless all of the registrable securities included in such demand registration have been sold to the public prior thereto in accordance with the plan of distribution specified in such registration statement. if a demand registration requested pursuant to this article i is deemed not to have been requested or effected as provided in this section 1.3, then the company shall continue to be obligated to effect the number of demand registrations set forth in section 1.2 without giving effect to such requested demand registration and will pay all registration expenses in connection with such demand registration. 3 48 1.4 priority on demand registrations. the company will not include in any demand registration any securities which are not registrable securities of the participating stockholders without the written consent of the requisite registration participants. if the requesting investors and other holders of registrable securities request registrable securities to be included in a demand registration which is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that in its opinion the number of registrable securities requested to be included exceeds the number of registrable securities which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the requisite requesting investors, the company will include any securities to be sold in such demand registration in the following order: (i) first, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the requesting investors in accordance with section 1.1(a); (ii) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by other participating stockholders in accordance with section 1.1(a); (iii) third, the securities which the company proposes to sell;

(b) the company may, upon written notice (a "black-out notice") to the requesting investors requesting a demand registration, require such requesting investors to withdraw such demand registration upon the good faith determination by the company that such postponement is necessary (i) to avoid disclosure of material non-public information or (ii) as a result of a pending material financing or acquisition transaction, and in each case, each of the rei stockholders may not request another demand registration for a period of up to 120 days, as specified by the company in such black-out notice. the company may only give a black-out notice where the giving of such notice has been specifically approved by the board of directors of the company. upon receipt of a black-out notice, the

registration of registrable securities (a "piggyback registration"), the company will give prompt written notice (in any event within 10 days after its receipt of notice of any exercise of other demand registration rights) to all participating stockholders of its intention to effect such a registration. such notice shall offer each participating stockholder the opportunity to register, on the same terms and conditions, such number of such participating stockholder's registrable securities as such participating stockholder may request. the company will include in such registration all

subject to the provisions of sections 2.3 and 2.4. such requests for inclusion shall specify the number of registrable securities intended to be disposed of and the intended method of distribution thereof. 2.2 piggyback expenses. the registration expenses of the participating stockholders will be paid by the company in all piggyback registrations. 5 50 2.3 priority on primary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the company, and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration is such that the success of the company's offering will be materially and adversely affected, then the company will include any securities to be sold in such piggyback registration in the following order: (i) first, the securities the company proposes to sell; (ii) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the

participate in such registration on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by each participating stockholder; and (iii) third, if all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the participating stockholders in accordance with section 2.1 are included in such registration, any other securities requested to be included in such registration in compliance with section 1.6. 2.4 priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the company's securities, and the managing underwriter advises the company in writing that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration

order: (i) first, the securities which such holders propose to sell in compliance with section 1.6; (ii) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the participating stockholders in accordance with section 2.1, provided that if the managing underwriter determines in good faith that a lower number of registrable securities of the participating

participate in such registration on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by each; and (iii) third, any other

representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such participating

stockholder's maximum liability in respect of its indemnification and contribution obligations under such underwriting agreement to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such

managers, partners, officers, directors, employees and general partners, as follows: (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (other than amounts paid in settlement) incurred by such person arising out of or based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or in any preliminary prospectus or prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 14 59 (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense incurred by such person to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental or regulatory authority, in each case whether commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever, that is based upon any such untrue statement or omission or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iii) against any and all expense incurred by such person in connection with investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental or regulatory authority, in each case whether commenced or threatened in writing, or against any claim whatsoever, that is based upon any such untrue statement or omission or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under clause (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of or based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of any participating stockholder expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or in any preliminary prospectus or prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further, however, that the company will not be liable to any participating stockholder (or any other indemnified person) under the indemnity agreement in this section 7.1, with respect to any preliminary prospectus or the final prospectus or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented, as the case may be, to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such participating stockholder (or other indemnified person) results from the fact that such participating stockholder sold registrable securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the final prospectus or of the final prospectus as then amended or supplemented, whichever is most recent, if the company has previously and timely furnished copies thereof to such participating stockholder. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any participating stockholder or any other person eligible for indemnification under this section 7.1, and shall survive the transfer of the relevant registrable securities by the participating stockholder who theretofore held them. 7.2 indemnification by a selling shareholder. in connection with 15 60 any registration statement which covers registrable securities of a participating stockholder pursuant to this agreement, each such participating stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 7.1 of this agreement), to the extent permitted by law, the company and each underwriter for the company or any such participating stockholder in connection therewith, each other person who controls the company or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, and each of their respective managers, officers, directors and general partners, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto or to any such prospectus, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information that relates only to such participating stockholder and its affiliates or the plan of distribution and that is furnished to the company by or on behalf of such participating stockholder expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any other person eligible under this section 7.2, and shall survive the transfer of registrable securities by such participating stockholder. the obligations of each participating stockholder pursuant to this section 7.2 are to be several and not joint. additionally, with respect to each claim pursuant to this section 7.2 and each corresponding claim for contribution under section 7.5, each such participating stockholder's maximum aggregate liability under this section 7.2 and section 7.5 shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such participating stockholder (after deducting any underwriting fees, discounts and expenses) from the sale of registrable securities being sold pursuant to such registration statement or prospectus by such participating stockholder. 7.3 indemnification procedure. within 10 days after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in section 7.1 or 7.2, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under section 7.1 or 7.2, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in such indemnified party's 16 61 reasonable judgment an actual or potential conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, in which case the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense of such claim but also shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of (i) in the case of a claim referred to in section 7.1, more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties selected by the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities held by such indemnified parties, or (ii) in the case of a claim referred to in section 7.2, more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for the company, in each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions or proceedings. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to (pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party an actual or potential conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels as may be reasonable in light of such conflict. the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not such indemnified party or any person who controls such indemnified party is a party to such claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding. an indemnified party will not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding in resect of which it is then seeking (or thereafter seeks) indemnification hereunder, in each case without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the rights set forth above, an indemnified party hereunder will have the right to retain, at its own expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim. 7.4 underwriting agreement. the company and each participating stockholder requesting registration of all or any part of its registrable securities pursuant to article i or ii, shall provide for the foregoing indemnity (with appropriate modifications) in any underwriting agreement entered into in connection with a demand registration or a piggyback registration with respect to any required registration or other qualification of registrable securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental or regulatory authority. 7.5 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this agreement is unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party under 17 62 such section, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to in section 7.1 or 7.2, as the case may be, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including the relative benefits received by each party from the offering of the securities covered by the relevant registration statement, the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the relevant claim was asserted and the parties' relative opportunities to correct and prevent any relevant statement or omission. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties' relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to relevant information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue or untrue statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 7.5 were to be determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first and second sentences of this section 7.5. the amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the first sentence of this section 7.5 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending the relevant action or proceeding and shall be limited as provided in section 7.3 if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of the relevant action or proceeding in accordance with the provisions of section 7.3. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 7.5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 7.5, such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof if the notice specified in section 7.3 has not been given with respect to such action or proceeding; provided, however, that the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this section 7.5, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. the company and the participating stockholders agree with each other, and will agree with and the underwriters of registrable securities registered pursuant to article i or ii, if requested by such underwriters, that (i) the underwriters' portion of the contribution paid to the participating stockholders pursuant to this section 7.5 shall not exceed the total underwriting fees, discounts and commissions in connection with the relevant offering of registrable securities and (ii) the total amount of such participating stockholder's contributions under this section 7.5 and any amounts paid by such participating 18 63 stockholder in respect of corresponding claims for indemnification under section 7.2 shall not exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such participating stockholder from the sale of registrable securities in the offering to which the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses of the indemnified parties relate. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7.6 periodic payments. the indemnification required by this article vii shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the relevant investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred; provided, however, that if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the relevant indemnified party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder in respect of such investigation or defense, such indemnified party shall repay to the indemnifying party, on demand, all amounts received by it in respect of such investigation or defense pursuant to this section 7.6, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published from time to time in the wall street journal) for the period from and including the date on which the indemnified party received the relevant amount to but excluding the date on which it repaid such amount to the indemnifying party. article viii rule 144 the company shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted by the commission thereunder (or, if the company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any participating stockholder, make publicly available other information), and it will take such further action as any participating stockholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such participating stockholder to sell shares of registrable securities without registration under the securities act in compliance with (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any participating stockholder, the company will deliver to such participating stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. article ix participation in underwritten registrations no participating stockholder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such participating stockholder (i) agrees to sell its 19 64 registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, escrow agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and consistent with the provisions of this agreement. if the requesting investors with respect to any demand registration are subsequently not entitled to participate in such demand registration solely by reason of their failure to comply with any material requirement of this article ix then, notwithstanding anything in section 1.1(b) or 1.3 to the contrary, the request by such requesting investors for such demand registration shall continue to be counted for purposes of section 1.2. article x definitions 10.1 terms. as used in this agreement, the following defined terms shall have the meanings set forth

(a) in the event that one or more lopker stockholders propose to transfer any shares (or other units) of subject securities (the "transferor shares") to any person (the "buyer"), other than a transfer to a permitted transferee or a rule 144 transaction (as such term is defined in the registration rights agreement), as a condition to such transfer, the lopker stockholders shall cause the buyer to offer (the "inclusion offer") to purchase from each rei stockholder, at such rei stockholder's option, up to that number of shares of subject securities determined in accordance with section 4(b) on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the transferor shares, except that each rei stockholder shall not be required to provide any representation, warranty or indemnification other than with respect to its ownership of, and authority to transfer, the subject securities owned by it free of any liens or encumbrances. the lopker stockholders shall provide prompt written notice to each rei stockholder (the "inclusion notice") setting forth all the terms and conditions of the inclusion offer, and each rei stockholder may accept the inclusion offer in whole or in part by providing a written notice of acceptance with respect to the subject securities owned by it to the lopker stockholders within 10 business days of delivery of the inclusion notice to it (the "acceptance notice"). (b) the rei stockholders, in the aggregate, shall have the right to sell, pursuant to the inclusion offer, subject securities representing (on a fully-diluted basis) the 81 same percentage of all shares of subject securities owned by them as the transferor shares are of all shares of subject securities (on a fully-diluted basis, but excluding any equity equivalents that are then either (i) not exercisable at the election of the holder thereof or (ii) "out of the money") owned by the lopker stockholders. in the event the number of shares of subject securities for which the rei stockholders elect to exercise such right, along with the shares of subject securities to be sold by the lopker stockholders, exceed the number of shares which the buyer is willing to purchase, the number of shares to be transferred to the buyer by each rei stockholder shall be reduced so that each rei stockholder is entitled to transfer the same percentage of its shares included in its acceptance notice as each other rei stockholder. (c) the lopker stockholders shall have 90 days, commencing on the date of the inclusion notice, in which to transfer, on behalf of themselves and the rei stockholders, up to the number of shares covered by the inclusion offer (including the transferor shares) to the buyer. the terms of such transfer, including, without limitation, price and form of consideration, shall be as set forth in the inclusion notice. if at the end of such 90 day period, the lopker stockholders have not completed the transfer of the shares of common stock proposed to be transferred, the lopker stockholders may not proceed with such transfer or any other transfer without first giving a new inclusion notice pursuant to the provisions of this section 4. (d) if the lopker stockholders are able to complete the transfer of the shares proposed to be transferred within such 90 day period, at the closing thereof, each rei stockholder shall deliver to the buyer a certificate or certificates representing the subject securities owned by it to be transferred pursuant to the inclusion offer, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and the buyer shall pay to each rei stockholder the purchase price for the subject securities so transferred pursuant to this section 4 and shall furnish such other evidence of the completion of such transfer and the terms thereof as may be reasonably requested by such rei stockholder. section 5. after-acquired shares. all of the provisions of this agreement shall apply to all of the subject securities now owned or hereafter issued or transferred to a stockholder in consequence of any additional issuance, purchase, exchange, exercise of conversion rights or reclassification of shares of common stock, corporate reorganization, or any other form of recapitalization, or consolidation, or merger, or share split, or share dividend, or capitalization issue; provided, however, that the provisions of this agreement shall not apply to any subject securities acquired by any rei stockholder from any person (other than any other rei stockholder or the company) after the date hereof, it being understood that the subject securities held by any rei stockholder shall be treated for purposes of this section 5 as being owned on a "first in, first out" basis. section 6. governing law. this agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of new york, except to the extent that the general corporation law of the state of delaware applies as a result of the company being incorporated in the state of delaware, in which case such general corporation law shall apply. 82 section 7. entire agreement; amendments. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed by (a) the company, (b) rei stockholders which then hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate shares of subject securities on a fully-diluted basis then held by all rei stockholders, and (c) lopker stockholders which then hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate shares of subject securities on a fully-diluted basis then held by all lopker stockholders. in the event of an amendment, modification or supplement of this agreement in accordance with its terms, each of the company and the stockholders shall take all actions reasonably within its control that are necessary or appropriate, within 30 calendar days following such amendment, modification or supplement, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, to cause the adoption of any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the company that may be required as a result of such amendment, modification or supplement to this agreement. the stockholders hereby agree to vote their shares of subject securities to approve each such amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the company. section 8. term. except for the provisions of sections 6 through 18 hereof, this agreement shall automatically and without further action terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the first date as of which the rei stockholders cease to own subject securities representing (on a fully-diluted basis) at least 25% of rei's original ownership level and (ii) the written agreement of (x) rei stockholders which then hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate shares of subject securities on a fully-diluted basis then held by all rei stockholders and (y) lopker stockholders which then hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate shares of subject securities on a fully-diluted basis then held by all lopker stockholders. section 9. waiver. no waiver by any party hereto of any term or condition of this agreement, in one or more instances, shall be valid unless in writing, and no such waiver shall be deemed to be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default of the same or any other term or condition hereof. section 10. successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns (including transferees of subject securities); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting any stockholder the right to transfer any of its subject securities except in accordance with this agreement. section 11. remedies. in the event of a breach by any party to this agreement of its obligations under this agreement, any party hereto injured by such breach, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees), will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement. the parties hereto agree that the provisions of this agreement shall be specifically enforceable, it being agreed by the parties hereto that the remedy at law, including monetary damages, for breach of any such provision will be inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. such equitable remedies and all other remedies are cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any remedies which any party hereto may have under this agreement or otherwise. 83 section 12. invalid provisions. if any provision of this agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. section 13. headings; certain conditions. the headings of the various articles and sections of this agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not define, limit or otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions hereof. unless the context otherwise expressly requires, all references herein to articles, sections and exhibits, are to article and sections of, and exhibits to, this agreement. the words "herein," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or provision. the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation". section 14. further assurances. each party hereto shall cooperate and shall take such further action and shall execute and deliver such further documents as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto in order to carry out the provisions and purposes of this agreement. section 15. gender. whenever the pronouns "he" or "his" are used herein they shall also be deemed to mean "she" or "hers" or "it" or "its" whenever applicable, and vice versa. words in the singular shall be read and construed as though in the plural and words in the plural shall be construed as though in the singular in all cases where they would so apply. section 16. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. section 17. notices.

(i) this warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised when all of the following items have been delivered to the company (the "exercise time"): (a) a completed exercise agreement, as described in section 1c below, executed by the person exercising all or part of the purchase rights represented by this warrant (the "purchaser"); (b) this warrant; (c) if the purchaser is not the registered holder, an assignment or assignments in the form set forth in exhibit ii hereto evidencing the assignment of this warrant to the purchaser; and (d) either (a) a check or wire transfer payable to the company in an amount equal to the product of (x) the exercise price multiplied by (y) the number of warrant shares being purchased upon such exercise (the "aggregate exercise price") or (b) the delivery of a notice to the company that the purchaser is exercising this warrant (or a portion thereof) by authorizing the company to reduce the number of warrant shares to be delivered to the purchaser upon such exercise of this warrant (or such portion thereof) by the number of warrant shares having an aggregate fair market value determined as of the exercise time equal to the aggregate exercise price. (ii) certificates for warrant shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) purchased upon exercise of this warrant shall be delivered by the company to the purchaser within three business days after the date of the exercise time. (iii) unless this warrant has expired or all of the purchase rights represented hereby have been exercised, the company shall prepare a new warrant, substantially identical hereto, representing the rights formerly represented by this warrant which have not expired or been exercised and shall, within three business days after the date of the exercise time, deliver such new warrant to the person designated for delivery in the exercise agreement. -2- 91 (iv) the warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be deemed to have been issued to the purchaser at the exercise time, and the purchaser shall be deemed for all purposes to have become the registered holder of such warrant shares at the exercise time. (v) the issuance of certificates for warrant shares upon exercise of this warrant shall be made without charge to the registered holder or the purchaser for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the company in connection with such exercise and the related issuance of warrant shares; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance of any warrants or any certificates representing warrant shares in a name other than that of a registered holder, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver such warrant or certificate for warrant shares unless and until the person requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. (vi) the company shall not close its books against the transfer of this warrant or of any warrant shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of this warrant in any manner which interferes with the timely exercise of this warrant. the company shall from time to time take all such action as may be necessary to assure that the par value per share, if any, of the unissued warrant shares acquirable upon exercise of this warrant is at all times equal to or less than the exercise price then in effect. in the event that the company fails to comply with its obligations set forth in the foregoing sentence, in addition to all other rights which the registered holder or purchaser may have at law or in equity, the purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) purchase warrant shares hereunder at par value, and the company shall be obligated to reimburse the purchaser for the aggregate amount of consideration paid in connection with such exercise in excess of the exercise price then in effect. (vii) the company shall assist and cooperate with any reasonable request by the registered holder or purchaser in connection with any governmental filings or approvals required to be obtained or made by any of them prior to or in connection with any exercise of this warrant (including, without limitation, making any filings or obtaining any approvals required to be made or obtained by the company). (viii) notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an exercise of any portion of this warrant is to be made in connection with a public offering or a sale of the company (pursuant to a merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise), then such exercise may at the election of the registered holder be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective until immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction. (ix) the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued warrant shares and solely for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise -3- 92 of this warrant, the maximum number of warrant shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant. all warrant shares which are so issuable shall, when issued and upon the payment of the applicable exercise price, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges. the company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such warrant shares may be so issued without violation by the company of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of any domestic securities exchange upon which shares of common stock or other securities constituting warrant shares may be listed (except for official notice of issuance which shall be immediately delivered by the company upon each such issuance) or any violation by the company of any agreement to which the company or any of its assets or properties may be subject. the company will cause the warrant shares, immediately upon such exercise, to be listed on each domestic securities exchange or quotation system upon which shares of common stock or other securities constituting warrant shares are listed or quoted at the time of such exercise. (x) if the warrant shares issuable by reason of exercise of this warrant are convertible into or exchangeable for any other stock or securities, then the company shall, at the purchaser's option and upon surrender of this warrant by such purchaser as provided above together with any notice, statement or payment required to effect such conversion or exchange of warrant shares, deliver to such purchaser (or as otherwise specified by such purchaser) a certificate or certificates representing the stock or securities into which the warrant shares issuable by reason of such exercise are convertible or exchangeable, registered in such name or names and in such denomination or denominations as such purchaser has specified. 1c. exercise agreement. upon any exercise of this warrant, the purchaser shall deliver to the company an exercise agreement in substantially the form set forth in exhibit i hereto, except that if the warrant shares are not to be issued in the name of the registered holder, the exercise agreement shall also state the name of the person to whom the certificates for the warrant shares are to be issued, and if the number of warrant shares to be issued does not include all of the warrant shares purchasable hereunder, it shall also state the name of the person to whom a new warrant for the unexercised portion of the rights hereunder is to be issued. section 2. adjustment of exercise price and number of shares. in order to prevent dilution of the rights granted under this warrant, the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 2, and the number of warrant shares obtainable upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time, as provided in this section 2. 2a. adjustment of exercise price and number of shares upon issuance of common stock. if and whenever, on or after the date of issuance, the company issues or sells, or in accordance with section 2b is deemed to have issued or sold, other than pursuant to a permitted issuance, and other than pursuant to an event for which an adjustment is made pursuant to section 2c, any shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the exercise -4- 93 price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then immediately upon such issuance or sale the exercise price shall be reduced to equal the amount determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale multiplied by the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (b) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which will be the product derived by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale. upon each such adjustment of the exercise price hereunder, the number of warrant shares acquirable upon exercise of this warrant shall be adjusted to equal the number of shares determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of warrant shares acquirable (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency) upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. for purposes of this section 2, the calculation of the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding shall exclude the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. 2b. effect on exercise price of certain events. for purposes of determining the adjusted exercise price under section 2a, the following shall be applicable: (i) issuance of rights or options. if the company in any manner grants any rights or options to subscribe for or to purchase (including, without limitation, the issuance of any notes or other debt instruments convertible into or payable in) common stock or any stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (including without limitation convertible common stock) (such rights or options being herein called "options" and such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities being herein called "convertible securities") other than a permitted issuance, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities is less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such price per share. for purposes of this paragraph, the "price per share for which common stock is issuable upon exercise of such options or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities" is determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the granting of such options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such options, plus in the case of such options which are exercisable for convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the issuance or sale of such convertible securities and the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such options or upon the conversion or exchange of all -5- 94 such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such options. no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon the exercise of such options or upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (ii) issuance of convertible securities. if the company in any manner issues or sells any convertible securities and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale, then the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be deemed to be outstanding from and after the date on which such convertible securities were issued and sold, and to have been issued and sold by the company for such price per share. for the purposes of this paragraph, the "price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange" is determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issue or sale of all such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities. no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and if any such issuance or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustment of the exercise price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 2b, no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale. (iii) change in option price or conversion rate. if the purchase price provided for in any options, the amount of common stock or convertible securities that may be purchased upon exercise of any option, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any convertible securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, changes at any time, the exercise price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted to the exercise price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, amount of common stock or convertible securities, additional consideration or changed conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold and the number of warrant shares shall be correspondingly readjusted. (iv) treatment of expired options and unexercised convertible securities. upon the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible securities, in either case without the exercise of such option or right, the exercise price then in effect and the number of warrant shares acquirable hereunder (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency) shall be adjusted to the exercise price and number of warrant shares which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had -6- 95 such option or convertible securities, to the extent not exercised in full and outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. (v) calculation of consideration received. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the company therefor. in case any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of marketable securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company shall be the market price thereof as of the date of receipt. in case any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger or other business combination in which the company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash or marketable securities shall be determined jointly by the company and the required holders. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within a reasonable period of time, such fair value shall be determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm jointly selected by the company and the required holders, whose determination shall be final and binding on the company and the registered holder. if the required holders and the company are unable to agree upon an independent investment banking or appraisal firm, then the required holders shall select one such independent investment banking or appraisal firm and the company shall select another such firm, and the calculation of fair value shall be made by a third independent investment banking or appraisal firm that has been selected by the two firms so chosen by the required holders and the company. in each such case, the firm calculating fair value shall submit to the company and to each registered holder such firm's written opinion addressed to each such registered holder setting forth such determination of fair value. if the independent investment banking or appraisal firm gives a range for its calculation of fair value, then fair value for purposes of this paragraph shall be the midpoint of such range. the fees and expenses of such firm shall be paid by the company. (vi) integrated transactions. in case any option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such options by the parties thereto, the option shall be deemed to have been issued for no consideration. (vii) treasury shares. for the purposes of this section 2, (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time does not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the company and (b) the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or sale of common stock. -7- 96 (viii)record date. if the company takes a record of the holders of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be either (x) the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or (y) the date of the issuance, granting or sale of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 2c. subdivision or combination of common stock. if the company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) the outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares or pays a dividend or makes a distribution to holders of the common stock in the form of shares of common stock, then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of warrant shares obtainable upon exercise of this warrant (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency), as the case may be, shall be proportionately increased. if the company at any time combines (by reverse stock split or otherwise) the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of warrant shares obtainable upon exercise of this warrant (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency), as the case may be, shall be proportionately decreased. 2d. organic change. any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets or other transaction which is effected in such a way that holders of common stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for common stock is referred to herein as an "organic change". prior to the consummation of any organic change, the company shall make appropriate provision (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the required holders) to ensure that each registered holder shall thereafter have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise thereof, in lieu of or addition to (as the case may be) the warrant shares immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such registered holder's warrants (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency), such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of warrant shares immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency) upon exercise of such registered holder's warrants had such organic change not taken place. in any such case, the company shall make appropriate provision (in form and substance satisfactory to the required holders) with respect to such registered holder's rights and interests to insure that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, sections 2, 3 and 4) shall thereafter be applicable to the warrants (including, without limitation, in the case of any such organic change in which the successor entity or purchasing entity is other than the company, an immediate adjustment of the exercise price to the product of the exercise price immediately prior to such organic change multiplied by the ratio of such value of the common stock reflected by the terms of such organic change divided by the fair market value of the common stock in effect -8- 97 immediately prior to such organic change and a corresponding immediate adjustment to the number of warrant shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the warrants (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency), if the value so reflected is less than the fair market value of the common stock in effect immediately prior to such organic change). the company shall not effect any such organic change unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the company) resulting from such organic change (including a purchaser of all or substantially all the company's assets) assumes by written instrument (in form and substance satisfactory to the required holders) the obligation to deliver to each registered holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such registered holder may be entitled to acquire upon exercise of warrants. 2e. certain events. if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 2 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features but excluding any permitted issuance), then the company's board of directors shall make an appropriate adjustment in the exercise price and the number of warrant shares obtainable upon exercise of this warrant (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency) so as to protect the rights of the registered holder of this warrant; provided that no such adjustment shall increase the exercise price or decrease the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise hereof other than as a readjustment in a manner consistent with that contemplated by section 2(b)(iv). 2f. actions to maintain exercise price above par price. before taking any action that would cause an adjustment to the exercise price such that, upon exercise of the warrant, warrant shares would be deemed to be issued below the then par value (if any) of the common stock, the company will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be reasonably necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable warrant shares at the exercise price. 2g. notices. (i) immediately upon any adjustment of the exercise price, the chief financial officer or president of the company shall compute such adjustment in accordance with the provisions hereof and prepare and sign a certificate showing such adjustment, and shall mail such certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holder. the certificate shall set forth the computations on which such adjustment is based, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, including without limitation a statement of the number of warrant shares which will issuable upon the exercise of this warrant. (ii) the company shall give written notice to the registered holder at least 30 days prior to the date on which the company closes its books or takes a record (a) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the common stock, (b) with respect to any pro rata -9- 98 subscription offer to holders of common stock, or (c) for determining rights to vote with respect to any organic change or any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company. (iii) the company shall also give written notice to the registered holder at least 30 days prior to the date on which any organic change or any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company shall take place. section 3. purchase rights. if at any time the company grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of the common stock (the "purchase rights"), then the registered holder shall be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which such registered holder would have acquired if such registered holder had held the maximum number of warrant shares acquirable (whether or not then acquirable or subject to a contingency) upon complete exercise of this warrant immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such purchase rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of common stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights. section 4. definitions. the following terms have the meanings set forth below and terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to them in the stock purchase agreement: "aggregate exercise price" has the meaning ascribed to it in section 1b(i)(d) hereof.
