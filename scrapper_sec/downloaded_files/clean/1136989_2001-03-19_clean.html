(ii) "buyer indemnified parties" means buyer and each officer, director, partner, member, manager, agent, employee, stockholder and other affiliate of buyer. (iii) "buyer indemnified representation costs" means any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, demands, charges, suits, penalties, costs, and expenses (including court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in investigating and preparing for any litigation or proceeding) that any of the buyer indemnified parties incurs in connection with, relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby and that arise out of any breach or default by the reit of any of the representations or warranties of the reit under this agreement or any agreement or document executed in connection herewith. 8.2 indemnification of the reit. from and after the first closing and subject to the provisions of this article 8 and section 9.2 below, buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the reit indemnified parties from and against any and all reit indemnified costs.

provided, however, that: (a) the indemnified party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of such third-party action (provided, however, that the indemnifying parties shall pay the legal fees of the indemnified party if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing by all indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such third-party action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to have charge of such third-party action, (iii) the indemnified party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that there may be defenses available to such indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) the indemnified party's counsel shall have advised the indemnified party in writing, with a copy delivered to the indemnifying party, that there is a material conflict of interest that could violate applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel); (b) the indemnifying party shall obtain the prior written approval of the indemnified party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such third-party action or any liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the indemnified party or if, in the opinion of the indemnified party, such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment could have a material adverse effect on its business; 45 54 (c) no indemnifying party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such third-party action; and (d) the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the indemnified party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action (i) as to which the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense within a reasonable length of time; or (ii) to the extent the third-party action seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the indemnified party which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations, assets, or financial condition of the indemnified party; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any indemnifying party without the prior written consent of such indemnifying party. the parties hereto shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense of any third-party action pursuant to this article 8 and, in connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals as may be reasonably requested. 8.4 direct claims. in any case in which an indemnified party seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to section 8.3 because no third-party action is involved, the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of any buyer indemnified costs or reit indemnified costs, as the case may be ("indemnified costs"), which indemnified party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8.5(c) and 9.2, the failure of the indemnified party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the indemnifying party with respect to such claim. 8.5 limitations. subject to section 9.2 hereof, the following provisions of this section 8.5 shall be applicable after the time of the first closing: (a) minimum loss. no indemnifying party shall be required to indemnify an indemnified party for buyer indemnified representation costs or reit indemnified representation costs, as the case may be ("indemnified representation costs"), unless and until the aggregate amount of such indemnified representation costs for which the indemnified party is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this article 8 exceeds $400,000 (the "minimum loss"). after the minimum loss is exceeded, the indemnified party shall be entitled to be paid the entire amount of its indemnified representation costs, including the full amount of the minimum loss, subject to the limitations on recovery and recourse set forth in this section 8.5. (b) determination of breach. for purposes of determining (i) whether an indemnifying party shall be required to indemnify an indemnified party under this article 8 or (ii) the aggregate amount of minimum loss suffered by an indemnified party, each representation and warranty contained in this agreement for which indemnification can be or is sought hereunder shall be read (including for purposes of determining whether a breach of such 46 55 representation or warranty has occurred) without regard to materiality (including material adverse effect) qualifications that may be contained therein. (c) limitation as to time. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any indemnified representation costs pursuant to this article 8 unless a written claim for indemnification in accordance with section 8.3 or 8.4 is given by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party with respect thereto on or before the first anniversary of the first closing date, except that this time limitation shall not apply to any (i) claims for fraud pursuant to section 9.2; (ii) claims for breaches of the representations and warranties contained in section 2.1(b) (relating to capital structure of the reit and its subsidiaries), section 2.1(c) (relating to authority of the reit and its subsidiaries), section 2.1(k) (relating to taxes) and section 2.1(o) (relating to environmental matters), which representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. (d) other indemnified costs. the provisions of this section 8.5 shall only be applied to indemnified representation costs and shall not be applicable to any other indemnified costs. (e) limitation as to amount. the indemnifying party's aggregate indemnity obligations to the indemnified parties under this agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the purchase price. 8.6 tax related adjustments. the reit and buyer agree that any payment of indemnified costs made hereunder will be treated by the parties on their tax returns as an adjustment to the purchase price. if, notwithstanding such treatment by the parties, any payment of indemnified costs is determined to be taxable income rather than adjustment to purchase price by any taxing authority, then the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party for any taxes payable by the indemnified party or any subsidiary by reason of the receipt of such payment (including any payments under this section 8.6), determined at an assumed marginal tax rate equal to the highest marginal tax rate then in effect for corporate taxpayers in the relevant jurisdiction. article 9 general provisions 9.1 survival of representations, warranties, and covenants. regardless of any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any party hereto or of any information any party may have in respect thereof, each of the representations and warranties made in this agreement or any other transaction document shall survive the first closing as provided below. the representations and warranties set forth in this agreement (other than representations and warranties contained in section 2.1(b) (relating to capital structure of the reit and its subsidiaries), section 2.1(c) (relating to authority of the reit and its subsidiaries), section 2.1(k) (relating to taxes) and section 2.1(o) (relating to environmental matters), which representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations) or any other transaction document shall terminate on the first anniversary of the first closing date. following the date of termination of a representation or warranty, no claim can be brought with respect to a breach of such representation or warranty, but no such 47 56 termination shall affect any claim for a breach of a representation or warranty that was asserted in writing pursuant to section 8.3 or section 8.4 hereof before the date of termination. to the extent that such are performable after the first closing or any subsequent closing, as applicable, each of the covenants and agreements contained in each of the transaction documents shall survive such closing indefinitely; provided, however, effective as of the first closing or any subsequent closing, the reit shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights and remedies as to any breach by buyer of any covenant and agreement of buyer contained in each transaction document occurring prior to such closing other than the obligation to acquire all subsequent closing shares. 9.2 no waiver relating to claims for fraud. the liability of any party under article 8 shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or equity based on such party's fraudulent acts or omissions. none of the provisions set forth in this agreement, including but not limited to the provisions set forth in section 8.5, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or equity based on any other party's fraudulent acts or omissions, nor shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud, (b) the time period during which a claim for fraud may be brought, or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek against another party with respect to a claim for fraud; provided, that with respect to such rights and remedies at law or equity, the parties further acknowledge and agree that none of the provisions of this section 9.2, nor any reference to this section 9.2 throughout this agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any defenses which may be available in respect of actions or claims for fraud, including but not limited to, defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages. 9.3 amendment and modification. this agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto or by buyer and the reit. 9.4 waiver of compliance. any failure of buyer on the one hand, or the reit, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition contained herein may be waived only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound by such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other failure. 9.5 specific performance. the parties recognize that in the event the reit should refuse to perform under the provisions of this agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate. buyer shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies which may be available, including money damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this agreement. in the event of any action to enforce this agreement specifically, the reit hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. in no event shall the reit be entitled to seek specific performance with respect to any of buyer's obligations arising under this agreement. 9.6 severability. if any term or other provision of this agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under any rule of applicable law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of 48 57 the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 9.7 expenses and obligations. (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement or as provided by law, if the first closing does not occur, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party which has incurred such expenses. if the first closing does occur, then, except as so provided, all costs and expenses incurred by the reit, on the one hand, and buyer, on the other, in connection with such consummation shall be borne solely and entirely by the reit and buyer, respectively. notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the first closing, buyer shall pay $131,250, the selling stockholders shall pay $71,250 in the aggregate and the reit shall pay $60,000 ($262,500 in total) to christopher weil & company, inc. as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. (b) in the event that (i) this agreement is terminated by the reit prior to the first closing pursuant to section 7.1(d)(i) or (ii) this agreement is terminated by buyer pursuant to section 7.1(c)(ii), section 7.1(c)(v), or section 7.1(c)(vi), then promptly after such termination (and in any event within one business day, except that any payment of the termination fee pursuant to subparagraph (i) above shall be paid simultaneously with, and be a necessary condition to, such termination), the reit shall pay buyer a fee of $10,000,000 million (the "termination fee") by wire transfer of same day funds; provided, however, that the amount of the termination fee payable to buyer upon a termination by buyer pursuant to section 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(c)(vi) shall be $3,500,000 rather than $10,000,000. the fee and other amounts payable pursuant to this section 9.7 shall be paid by the reit without reservation of rights or protests and the reit, upon making such payment, shall be deemed to have released and waived any and all rights that it may have to recover such amounts. 9.8 parties in interest. this agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided below, inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their successors, assigns and transferees, and nothing in this agreement, except as set forth below, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person (other than the indemnified parties as provided in article 8 and any released parties under section 7.3) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this agreement. 9.9 notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied, or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), or sent by federal express or other recognized overnight courier, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice): 49 58 (a) if to buyer, to: lone star fund iii (u.s.), l.p. 600 north pearl street suite 1500, lb 164 dallas, texas 75201 attention: j.d. dell facsimile: (214) 754-8401 with copies (which shall not constitute notice) to: vinson & elkins l.l.p. 3700 trammell crow center 2001 ross avenue dallas, texas 75201 attention: michael d. wortley facsimile: (214) 999-7732 (b) if to the reit, to: u.s. restaurant properties, inc. 12240 inwood road suite 200 dallas, texas 75244 attention: fred h. margolin facsimile: (972) 233-6453 with copies (which shall not constitute notice) to: locke liddell & sapp llp 2200 ross avenue suite 2200 dallas, texas 75201 attention: kenneth l. betts facsimile: (214) 740-8800 any of the above addresses may be changed at any time by notice given as provided above;

or 7.1(d) and to receive payment of the liquidated damages described below as provided in this section 7.2. if this agreement is terminated by the stockholders pursuant to section 7.1(b)(i) or 7.1(d), the parties agree and acknowledge that the stockholders will suffer damages that are not practicable to ascertain. accordingly, in such event and if, within ten business days after termination of this

right to terminate this agreement and to receive payment of the liquidated damages described above as provided in this section 7.2 shall be the stockholders' sole and exclusive right and remedy if the

(a) if any third party shall notice the buyer indemnified parties or the stockholders, as the case may be (the "indemnified party"), with respect to any matter which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other party (the "indemnifying party") under this article 8, then the indemnified party shall notify each indemnifying party thereof promptly; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the indemnified party in notifying any indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party from any liability or obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the indemnifying party thereby is damaged. in the event any indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within 15 days after the indemnified party has given notice of the matter that the indemnifying party is assuming the defense thereof, (i) the indemnifying party will defend the indemnified party against the matter with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, (ii) the indemnified party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except that the indemnifying party will be responsible for the fees and expenses of the separate co-counsel to the extent the indemnified party concludes reasonably that the counsel the indemnifying party has selected has a conflict of interest), (iii) the indemnified party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement from all liability with respect to the matter without the written consent of the indemnifying party (not to be withheld unreasonably) and (iv) the indemnifying party will not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter, or enter into any settlement from all liability with respect thereto, without the written consent of the indemnified party (not to be withheld unreasonably). an indemnifying party who fails to give the indemnified party notice within such 15-day period that the indemnifying party is assuming the defense of the matter shall have waived its right to assume the defense thereof. 17 24 (b) notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.3(a), the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the indemnified party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgement of any third-party action to the extent that the third-party action seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the indemnified party which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations, assets, or financial condition of the indemnified party. the parties hereto shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense of any third-party action pursuant to this article 8 and, in connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested. 8.4 direct claims. in any case in which an indemnified party seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to section 8.3 because no third-party action is involved, the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of any buyer indemnified costs or stockholder indemnified costs, as the case may be ("indemnified costs"), which such indemnified party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. subject to the limitations set forth in section 9.2, the failure of the indemnified party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless (and then solely to the extent) the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the indemnifying party with respect to such claim. 8.5 limitations. the following provisions of this section 8.5 shall be applicable after the time of the closing: (a) limitation as to time. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any indemnified costs pursuant to this article 8 unless a written claim for indemnification in accordance with section 8.3 or 8.4 is given by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party with respect thereto on or before the first anniversary of the closing date, except that this time limitation shall not apply to any (i) claims for fraud pursuant to section 9.2 or (ii) claims for breaches of the representations and warranties contained in section 2.1(a) (relating to ownership of the securities) and section 2.1(b) (relating to capacity of the stockholders), which representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

provided, however, effective as of the closing, the stockholders, on the one hand, and buyer, on the other hand, shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights and remedies as to any breach by the other party of any covenant and agreement of such party contained in each transaction document to be performed by such party at or prior to the closing. 9.2 no waiver relating to claims for fraud. the liability of any party under article 8 shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or equity based on such party's fraudulent acts or omissions. none of the provisions set forth in this agreement, including but not limited to the provisions set forth in section 8.5, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or equity based on any other party's fraudulent acts or omissions, nor shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (a) the time period during which a claim for fraud may be brought, or (b) the recourse which any such party may seek against another party with respect to a claim for fraud; provided, that with respect to such rights and remedies at law or equity, the parties further acknowledge and agree that none of the provisions of this section 9.2, nor any reference to this section 9.2 throughout this agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any defenses which may be available in respect of actions or claims for fraud, including but not limited to, defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages. 9.3 amendment and modification. this agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto or by buyer and the stockholders (or, in the case of the margolin stockholders and the rolph stockholders, by the margolin stockholders' representative and/or the rolph stockholders' representative, as applicable). 19 26 9.4 waiver of compliance. any failure of buyer on the one hand, or a stockholder, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition contained herein may be waived only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound by such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other failure. 9.5 specific performance. the parties recognize that in the event a stockholder should refuse to perform under the provisions of this agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate. buyer shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies which may be available, including money damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this agreement. provided that buyer timely complies with its obligations under section 1.4, in the event of any action to enforce this agreement specifically, the stockholders hereby waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. provided that buyer timely complies with its obligations under section 1.4, in no event shall the stockholders be entitled to seek specific performance with respect to any of buyer's obligations arising under this agreement. 9.6 severability. if any term or other provision of this agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under any rule of applicable law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 9.7 expenses and obligations. except as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement or as provided by law, if the closing does not occur, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party which has incurred such expenses;

(a) request for registration. (i) holders of a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the holders may make up to three written requests for a demand registration of all or any part of the registrable securities held by the holders; provided, that (a) each such demand registration by the holders must be in respect of registrable securities with a fair market value of at least $5,000,000, on the date such request is made or all of the registrable securities held by the requesting holders if the aggregate fair market value of all of such registrable securities is less than $5,000,000 and (b) the holders shall not be entitled to a demand registration if, during the 120 days preceding such request, the holders had requested a demand registration, unless the company preempted such demand registration in accordance with section 2.1(e) or the company postponed the filing thereof in accordance with section 3.1(a) and the requesting holders withdrew the request for such demand registration. (ii) any request for a demand registration will specify the aggregate number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be sold by the requesting holders and will also specify the intended method of disposition thereof. a registration will not count as a demand registration until it has become effective. should a demand registration not become effective due to the failure of a holder to perform its obligations under this agreement or the inability of the requesting holders to reach agreement with the underwriters for the proposed sale on price or other customary terms for such transaction, or in the event the requesting holders withdraw or do not pursue the request for the demand registration (in each of the foregoing cases, provided that at such time the company is in compliance in all material respects with its obligations under this 3 6 agreement), then, subject to section 2.1(b), such demand registration shall be deemed to have been effected; provided that (i) if the demand registration does not become effective because a material adverse change has occurred, or is reasonably likely to occur, in the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole subsequent to the date of the written request made by the requesting holders, (ii) if the company withdraws the demand registration for any reason or preempts the request for the demand registration or (iii) if, after the demand registration has become effective, an offering of registrable securities pursuant to a registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction, or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court or (iv) if the demand registration is withdrawn at the request of the requesting holders pursuant to section 2.1(f) or section 3.1(a), then the demand registration shall not be deemed to have been effected and will not count as a demand registration. (iii) upon receipt of any request for a demand registration by holders of a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the holders, the company shall promptly (but in any event within ten days) give written notice of such proposed demand registration to all other holders and all such holders shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the company within twenty days of their receipt of the company's notice, to elect to include in such demand registration such portion of their registrable securities as they may request. all such holders requesting to have their registrable securities included in a demand registration in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be "requesting holders" for purposes of this section 2.1. (b) in the event that the requesting holders withdraw or do not pursue a request for a demand registration and, pursuant to section 2.1(a) hereof, such demand registration is deemed to have been effected, the holders may reacquire such demand registration (such that the withdrawal or failure to pursue a request will not count as a demand registration hereunder) if the requesting holders reimburse the company for any and all registration expenses incurred by the company in connection with such request for a demand registration that was withdrawn or not pursued. (c) if the requesting holders so elect, the offering of such registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of a "firm commitment" underwritten offering. a majority in interest of the requesting holders shall have the right to select the managing underwriters and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with any offering under this section 2.1, subject to the company's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. (d) the requesting holders will inform the company of the time and manner of any disposition of registrable securities; provided, however, that the holders' only right to a shelf registration statement shall be pursuant to section 2.3. (e) the company will have the right to preempt any demand registration with a primary registration by delivering written notice (within seven business days after the company has received a request for such demand registration) of such intention to the requesting holders indicating that the company has identified a specific business need and use for the 4 7 proceeds of the sale of such securities and had contemplated such sale of securities prior to receiving the requesting holders' notice, and the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect a primary registration within 30 days of such notice. in the ensuing primary registration, the holders will have such piggyback registration rights as are set forth in section 2.2 hereof. upon the company's preemption of a requested demand registration, such requested registration will not count as the holders' demand registration. if the company thereafter decides to abandon its intention to pursue such sale of securities, it shall give notice thereof to any preempted holders within two business days following the company's decision. the company may exercise the right to preempt a demand registration only once in any 360-day period; provided that during any 360-day period the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit a period of at least 180 consecutive days during which the selling holders may effect a demand registration. (f) securities to be sold for the account of any person (including the company) other than a requesting holder shall not be included in a demand registration if the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the company and the requesting holders in writing that the inclusion of such securities will materially and adversely affect the price of the offering (a "material adverse effect"). furthermore, in the event the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the company or the requesting holders that even after exclusion of all securities of other persons (including the company) pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the amount of registrable securities proposed to be included in such demand registration by requesting holders is sufficiently large to cause a material adverse effect, the registrable securities of the requesting holders to be included in such demand registration shall equal the number of shares which the company and the requesting holders are so advised can be sold in such offering without a material adverse effect and such shares shall be allocated pro rata among the requesting holders on the basis of the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by each such requesting holder; provided, however, that if any registrable securities requested to be registered pursuant to a demand registration under section 2.1 are excluded from registration hereunder, then the holder(s) having shares excluded ("excluded holders") shall have the right to withdraw all, or any part, of their shares from such registration and if withdrawn in full such demand registration shall not be deemed to have been effected on the withdrawing holder's or holders' behalf and will not count as a demand registration for such withdrawing holder(s). 2.2 piggyback registration. (a) if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of common stock for its own account or for the account of another person (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 (or any substitute form or rule, respectively, that may be adopted by the commission)), the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders at the address set forth in the share register of the company as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event less than 15 days before the anticipated filing date), undertaking to provide each holder the opportunity to register on the same terms and conditions such number of shares of registrable securities as such holder may request (a "piggyback registration"). each holder will have seven business days after receipt of any such notice to notify the company as to whether it wishes to participate in a piggyback registration (which notice shall not be deemed to be a request for a demand registration); 5 8 provided that should a holder fail to provide timely notice to the company, such holder will forfeit any rights to participate in the piggyback registration with respect to such proposed offering other than as described in section 2.1(a)(iii). if the company or the person for whose account such offering is being made shall determine in its sole discretion not to register or to delay the proposed offering, the company may, at its election, provide written notice of such determination to the holders and (i) in the case of a determination not to effect the proposed offering, shall thereupon be relieved of the obligation to register such registrable securities in connection therewith, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay a proposed offering, shall thereupon be permitted to delay registering such registrable securities for the same period as the delay in respect of the proposed offering. as between the company or any other person for whose account any such offering is being made, on one hand, and the selling holders, on the other hand, the company or such other person, as the case may be, shall be entitled to select the underwriters in connection with any piggyback registration. (b) if the registrable securities requested to be included in the piggyback registration by any holder differ from the type of securities proposed to be registered by the company and the managing underwriter advises the company that due to such differences the inclusion of such registrable securities would cause a material adverse effect, then (i) the number of such holders' registrable securities to be included in the piggyback registration shall be reduced to an amount which, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would eliminate such material adverse effect or (ii) if no such reduction would, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, eliminate such material adverse effect, then the company shall have the right to exclude all such registrable securities from such piggyback registration, provided that no other securities of such type are included and offered for the account of any other person in such piggyback registration. any partial reduction in number of registrable securities of any holder to be included in the piggyback registration pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be effected pro rata based on the ratio which such holder's requested shares bears to the total number of shares requested to be included in such piggyback registration by all persons other than the company who have the contractual right to request that their shares be included in such registration statement and who have requested that their shares be included. if the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement are of the same type as the securities being registered by the company (whether such registration is initiated by the company or another security holder) and the managing underwriter advises the company that the inclusion of such registrable securities would cause a material adverse effect, the company will be obligated to include in such registration statement, as to each holder and any other person or persons having a contractual right to request their shares be included in such registration only a portion of the shares such holder and such other person or persons have requested be registered equal to the ratio which each such holder's and such other person's requested shares bears to the total number of shares requested to be included in such registration statement by all holders and such other person or persons (other than the person or persons initiating such registration request) having a contractual right to request that their shares be included in such registration statement and who have requested their shares be included. if the company initiated the registration, then the company may include all of its securities in such registration statement before any such holder's requested shares are included. if another security holder initiated the registration, then such initiating security holder may include all of its securities in such registration statement before any such holder's requested shares are included and the company may not include any of its securities in such registration statement unless all 6 9 registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement by all holders are included in such registration statement. if as a result of the provisions of this section 2.2(b) any holder shall not be entitled to include all registrable securities in a registration that such holder has requested to be so included, such holder may withdraw such holder's request to include registrable securities in such registration statement prior to its effectiveness. 2.3 shelf registration. (a) holders of a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the holders ("majority holders") may, at any time beginning 90 days after the closing date, make a written request that the company effect a shelf registration of all or any portion of the registrable securities held by the holders (the "shelf registration") pursuant to rule 415. upon receipt of a request for the shelf registration, the company shall promptly (but in any event within ten business days) give written notice of the proposed shelf registration to all other holders, and all such holders (including their future direct and indirect transferees to the extent permitted by the commission) shall have the right to include registrable securities in the shelf registration. the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 45 days after the time such obligation to file arises) with the commission, and thereafter shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective within 180 days after the filing thereof, a shelf registration statement on an appropriate form under the securities act covering all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests from holders for inclusion therein within 30 days after delivery to the holders of the company's notice. each such holder's request shall specify the number of registrable securities to be registered and the intended method of disposition. (b) the company shall use its best efforts to keep the shelf registration continuously effective for a period terminating the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which the commission declares the shelf registration effective and (ii) the date on which all the registrable securities covered by the shelf registration have been sold pursuant to such shelf registration. (c) the company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the shelf registration, if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by the company or by the securities act or requested by the holders of a majority of the registrable securities covered by such registration or any underwriter of the registrable securities. 7 10 (d) the holders' rights to require a shelf registration shall include the right to require one underwritten offering off the shelf registration statement (a "take-down") plus an additional number of take-downs equal to the number of unused demand registrations then remaining (as provided in section 2.2(a)(i)); provided that any such takedown shall be in respect of registrable securities having a fair market value of at least $5,000,000 on the date such request is made. any holder having registrable securities representing at least a majority of the registrable securities included in an effective registration statement pursuant to a shelf registration may request an underwritten take-down, and the company shall be obligated to give notice and opportunity to participate in the take-down to the other holders having registrable securities included in the shelf registration, in accordance with the same procedures, limitations and allocations applicable to a demand registration (with such changes in those procedures, limitations and allocations as are necessary to reflect that it is a take-down). no holder may request a take-down for a number of such holder's registrable securities that exceeds the number of that holder's registrable securities already included in the effective shelf registration. no other securities of the company may be included in an effective registration statement pursuant to a shelf registration other than the registrable securities. article iii registration procedures 3.1 filings; information. in connection with the registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 2.1, section 2.2 and section 2.3 hereof, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) the company will expeditiously prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies and which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become and remain effective (i) with respect to any demand registration or piggyback registration, for such period, not to exceed 60 days, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the sale of such securities, (ii) with respect to a shelf registration, until the earlier of the sale of all registrable securities thereunder and the fifth anniversary of the date on which the commission declares the shelf registration effective; provided that if the company shall furnish to the selling holder a certificate signed by the company's chairman, president or any executive vice-president or vice-president stating that the company's board of directors has determined in good faith that it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to the company or its stockholders for such a registration statement to be filed as expeditiously as possible because the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement or the disclosure of information in any related prospectus or prospectus supplement would materially interfere with any acquisition, financing or other material event or transaction which is then intended or the public disclosure of which at the time would be materially prejudicial to the company, the company may postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a period of not more than 120 days; provided that 8 11 during any 360-day period the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit a period of at least 180 consecutive days during which the company will make a registration statement available under this agreement; and provided further that if (i) the effective date of any registration statement filed pursuant to a demand registration would otherwise be at least 45 calendar days, but fewer than 90 calendar days, after the end of the company's fiscal year, and (ii) the securities act requires the company to include audited financials as of the end of such fiscal year, the company may delay the effectiveness of such registration statement for such period as is reasonably necessary to include therein its audited financial statements for such fiscal year. if the company exercises its right to postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement, the applicable requesting holders shall be entitled to withdraw their request for such demand registration and it shall not count as a demand registration. (b) anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that the company shall not be required to keep any shelf registration effective or useable for offers and sales of the registrable securities, file a post effective amendment to a shelf registration statement or prospectus supplement or to supplement or amend any registration statement, if the company is then involved in discussions concerning, or otherwise engaged in, any material financing or investment, acquisition or divestiture transaction or other material business purpose if the company determines in good faith that the making of such a filing, supplement or amendment at such time would interfere with such transaction or purpose; provided that under no circumstances may such postponement exceed 90 days from the date on which the company notifies the holders of such postponement, as provided hereafter. the company shall promptly give the holders of registrable securities written notice of such postponement containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay. upon receipt by a holder of registrable securities of notice of an event of the kind described in this section 3.1(b), such holder shall forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of registrable securities until such holder's receipt of notice from the company that such disposition may continue and of any supplemented or amended prospectus indicated in such notice. the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to permit sales of registrable securities on such shelf registration statement for at least 180 days during any 360-day period. in the event the company shall give notice of an event of the kind described in this section 3.1(b), the company shall extend the period during which the applicable registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.1(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the company shall give notice to the selling holders that such dispositions of such registrable securities may continue and shall have made available to the selling holders any such supplemented or amended prospectus. (c) the company will, if requested, prior to filing such registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to the selling holders, and each applicable managing underwriter, if any, copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to the selling holders and each such underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration statement, amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as the selling holders or each such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities by the selling holders. 9 12 (d) after the filing of the registration statement, the company will promptly notify the selling holders of any stop order issued or, to the company's knowledge, threatened to be issued by the commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered. (e) in addition to the requirements imposed on the company elsewhere herein, the company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to qualify the registrable securities for offer and sale under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as the selling holders reasonably request; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period in which such registration statement is required to be kept effective; and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each selling holder to consummate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such selling holder in such jurisdictions; provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this section 3.1(e), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction. (f) the company will as promptly as is practicable notify the selling holders, at any time when a prospectus relating to the sale of the registrable securities is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an underwriter or dealer, of the occurrence of any event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and promptly make available to the selling holders and to the underwriters any such supplement or amendment. upon receipt of any notice of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in the preceding sentence, selling holders will forthwith discontinue the offer and sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such registrable securities until receipt by the selling holders and the underwriters of the copies of such supplemented or amended prospectus and, if so directed by the company, the selling holders will deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the possession of selling holders, of the most recent prospectus covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. in the event the company shall give such notice, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 3.1(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the company shall make available to the selling holders such supplemented or amended prospectus. furthermore, in the event the company shall give such notice, the company shall, as promptly as is practical, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the registrable securities being sold thereunder, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 10 13 (g) the company will enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions (including, without limitation, participation in road shows and investor conference calls) as are required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities.

securities and other information as the company may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration. 3.2 registration expenses. in connection with any registration effected hereunder, the company shall pay all expenses incurred in connection with such registration (the "registration expenses"), including without limitation: (i) registration and filing fees with the commission and the national association of securities dealers, inc., (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the registrable securities), (iii) printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing or quotation of the registrable securities, (v) fees and expenses of counsel to the company and the reasonable fees and expenses of independent certified public accountants for the company (including fees and expenses associated with the special audits or the delivery of comfort letters together with the fees and expenses of one counsel for the selling holders), (vi) the reasonable fees and expenses of any additional experts retained by the company in connection with such registration, (vii) all roadshow costs and expenses not paid by the underwriters, and (viii) the fees and expenses of 12 15 other persons retained by the company will be borne by the company, whether or not any registration statement becomes effective; provided that in no event shall registration expenses include any underwriting discounts or commissions or transfer taxes or the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the selling holders. article iv indemnification and contribution 4.1 indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each selling holder and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, partners, stockholders, members, employees, agents and representatives and each person (if any) which controls a selling holder within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by, arising out of, resulting from or related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained or incorporated by reference in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by or based upon any information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use therein or by the selling holder's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished the selling holder with copies of the same; provided, however, that the company shall have no obligation to indemnify under this sentence to the extent any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities have been finally and non-appealably determined by a court to have resulted from such selling holder's willful misconduct or gross negligence. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling holders provided in this section 4.1, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by or based upon any information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such underwriter expressly for use therein or by the underwriter's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished the underwriter with copies of the same; provided, however, that the company shall have no obligation to indemnify under this sentence to the extent any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities have been finally and non-appealably determined by a court to have resulted from any such underwriter's willful misconduct or gross negligence. 4.2 indemnification by selling holders. each selling holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, which controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the 13 16 foregoing indemnity from the company to each selling holder, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each selling holder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the company provided in this section 4.2, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such selling holder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. each such selling holder's liability under this section 4.2 shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses) received by such selling holder from the sale of such registrable securities by such selling holder. the obligation of each selling holder shall be several and not joint. 4.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or section 4.2, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and, in the written opinion of counsel for the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. 4.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article iv is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities in respect of which indemnity is to 14 17 be provided hereunder, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall to the fullest extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company, a selling holder and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and each selling holder agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this article iv, no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and each selling holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds of the offering (before deducting expenses) received by such selling holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such selling holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article v miscellaneous 5.1 participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody arrangements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this agreement and (c) furnishes in writing to the company such information regarding such person, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as the company may from time to time request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration; provided, however, that no such 15 18 person shall be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with any such registration other than representations and warranties as to (i) such person's ownership of his or its registrable securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, (ii) such person's power and authority to effect such transfer and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws as may be reasonably requested; provided further, however, that the obligation of such person to indemnify pursuant to any such underwriting agreements shall be several, not joint and several, among such persons selling registrable securities, and the liability of each such person will be in proportion to, and provided further that such liability will be limited to, the net amount received by such person from the sale of such person's registrable securities pursuant to such registration. 5.2 rule 144. the company covenants that it will file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and that it will take such further action as the holders may reasonably request to the extent required from time to time to enable the holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such reporting requirements. 5.3 holdback agreements. (a) the holders. each holder, for so long as he or it individually owns registrable securities representing ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the company, agrees, in the event of an underwritten offering by the company (whether for the account of the company or otherwise) not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including any sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (except as part of such underwritten offering), during the 14 days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or such lesser period as the lead or managing underwriters may require) beginning on, the effective date of the registration statement for such underwritten offering (or, in the case of an offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to rule 415, the pricing date for such underwritten offering), provided that in connection with such underwritten offering each officer and director of the company and holder of ten percent or more of the common stock is subject to restrictions substantially equivalent to those imposed on the holders. (b) restrictions on public sale by the company. the company agrees (i) without the written consent of the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering of registrable securities covered by a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement, not to effect any public or private sale or distribution of its equity securities, including a sale pursuant to regulation d under the securities act, during the period beginning 14 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such registration statement (except (w) on form s-8 or any successor form to such form, (x) upon the exercise of any warrants, options or other securities exercisable or convertible into common stock 16 19 outstanding on the date hereof or (y) the grant or exercise of options to employees of the company pursuant to any duly adopted employee stock option plan); provided, however, that such period shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of any notice pursuant to section 3.1(f) hereof to and including the date when each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 3.1(f) hereof, and (ii) to cause each holder of its equity securities purchased from the company at any time on or after the date of this agreement (other than equity securities purchased in a registered public offering) to agree not to effect any public sale or distribution of any such equity securities during such periods, including a sale pursuant to rule 144. 5.4 termination. the registration rights granted under this agreement will terminate on december 31, 2015, or such earlier time as there shall no longer be any registrable securities. 5.5 amendments, waivers, etc. this agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the company and the holders of at least a majority of the registrable securities then held by all the holders, if the amendment is to be effective against the holders. 5.6 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. each party need not sign the same counterpart. 5.7 entire agreement. this agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 5.8 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of maryland regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. 5.9 assignment of registration rights. each holder of the registrable securities may assign all or any part of its rights under this agreement to any person to whom such holder sells, transfers, assigns or pledges such registrable securities. in the event that the holder shall assign its rights pursuant to this agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all its registrable securities, the holder shall also retain its rights with respect to its remaining registrable securities. 17 20 5.10 binding effect. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company and any successor organization which shall succeed to substantially all of the business and property of the company, whether by merger, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or otherwise, including by operation of law ("successor"). the company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall cause any successor to adopt and assume this agreement. if a parent entity of the company or its successor becomes the issuer of the registrable securities, then the company or such successor shall cause such parent entity to adopt and assume this agreement to the same extent as if the parent entity were the company or such successor. 18 21 in witness whereof, the company and each holder has caused this agreement to be signed on its behalf by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of the date first written above. u.s. restaurant properties, inc. by: /s/ barbara a. erhart --------------------------------- name: barbara a. erhart title: chief

(this "agreement") is made and entered into as of march 9, 2001, by and between u.s. restaurant properties, inc., a maryland corporation (the "company"), lsf3 capital investments i, llc, a delaware limited liability company ("buyer 1"), and lsf3 capital investments ii, llc, a delaware limited liability company ("buyer 2") (buyer 1 and buyer 2 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "buyer"). r e c i t a l s a. buyer proposes to purchase from the company and from stockholders of the company (with such collective purchases referred to herein as the "acquisitions") approximately 3,729,765 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the company ("common stock"). b. to help the company maintain its status as a reit, the company's restated articles of incorporation (the "articles"), impose certain limitations on the ownership of the company's stock. capitalized terms used in this agreement that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the articles. the articles contain a general restriction prohibiting any person from owning more than a specified percentage (initially set at 9.8%) of the common stock of the company and any series of preferred stock of the company. c. pursuant to section 7.10 of the articles, the company's board of directors is permitted to increase the common stock ownership limit with respect to a stockholder (as to such stockholder, an "excepted holder limit") and allow ownership in excess of the common stock ownership limit if certain conditions described in section 7.11 of the articles are satisfied. d. this agreement is intended to recognize that the board of directors of the company has agreed to increase the common stock ownership limit of buyer if certain conditions are satisfied and buyer intends to satisfy such conditions by execution of this agreement. a g r e e m e n t 1. representations and covenants of buyer 1 and buyer 2 beginning on the date hereof, and during any period that an excepted holder limit established pursuant to this agreement (as subsequently adjusted) remains in effect, buyer 1 and buyer 2 represent and agree, severally and not jointly, as follows: 1.1 as required by section 7.11(a) of the articles as a prerequisite to increasing the common stock ownership limit of a stockholder, assuming no individual, as such term is defined in code section 542(a)(2), is currently in violation of its 9.8% common stock ownership limit, the acquisitions will not cause the company to be "closely held" within the meaning of section 856(h) of the code (assuming ownership of shares of equity stock by all c-1 2 persons equal to the greatest of (i) the actual ownership, (ii) the beneficial ownership of equity stock by each person or (iii) the applicable ownership limit with respect to such person). 1.2 applying the constructive stock ownership rules of code section 856(h), common stock purchased by buyer pursuant to the acquisitions will not be considered to be owned by any individual, as such term is defined in code section 542(a)(2), who would be treated as owning common stock in excess of his common stock ownership limit of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company. if at any time after the date of this agreement, under the constructive ownership rules of code section 856(h) and taking the common stock owned by buyer into account, an individual, as such term is defined in section 542(a)(2) of the code, would be treated as owning common stock in excess of such individual's common stock ownership limit in violation of section 7.2, the excess stock and other provisions of section 7.2 of the articles shall be applied first to the common stock actually owned by such individual, second to the common stock treated as owned by such individual (other than as a result of common stock actually owned by buyer) and third to the common stock treated as owned by such individual as a result of common stock actually owned by buyer. 1.3 buyer will not own, actually, beneficially, or constructively shares of the company's equity stock that would violate the excepted holder limit established for buyer pursuant to this agreement and the resolutions of the board of directors. 1.4 as modified by section 1.2 above, buyer agrees that any violation or attempted violation of article 1 of this agreement or the provisions of the board of directors' resolution implementing this agreement (or other action contrary to the ownership restrictions imposed under the articles) will automatically subject the shares that otherwise would result in the violation to the treatment described in section 7.2 of the articles. 2. establishment of an excepted holder limit for buyer based on the representations and agreements contained in this agreement, the company, effective as of the execution of this agreement, is increasing the common stock ownership limit of buyer by adopting a resolution of its board of directors in the form attached to this agreement as exhibit "a." 3. related party rents 3.1 buyer 1 and buyer 2 hereby represent, severally and not jointly, that, to the best knowledge of such buyer based upon the due diligence described below, such buyer and each indirect equity owner does not own (directly or constructively through the application of code section 318, as modified by code section 856(d)(5)) an interest in any tenant of the company (or any entity owned or controlled by the company) listed on schedule 1 attached hereto that would cause the company to own (directly or constructively through the application of code section 318, as modified by code section 856(d)(5)) more than a 9.9% interest (within the meaning of section 856(d)(2)(b) of the code) in such tenant, without regard to the other interests in such tenant which the company may own (directly or constructively through the application c-2 3 of code section 318, as modified by code section 856(d)(5)). the due diligence referred to above consisted of a review by buyer 1 and buyer 2, respectively, of the most recently received copies of all financial reports received from (i) each partnership or limited liability company in which buyer 1 and buyer 2, as the case may be, directly or indirectly holds an equity interest; and (ii) each corporation or trust in which buyer 1 and buyer 2, as the case may be, directly or indirectly or indirectly owns a 10% or greater equity interest (which financial reports describe all entities in which such partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations and trust own an equity interest as of the date of such reports) and comparing the information contained in such financial reports to schedule 1. for purposes of this agreement, an "indirect equity owner" means any person (i) that is deemed to beneficially own or constructively own an interest in shares of the company that are held by buyer, and (ii) whose direct or indirect ownership of any interest in any tenant of the company would be attributed to the company through the application of section 318 of the code, as modified by code section 856(d)(5). in addition, buyer 1 and buyer 2 have received representations from each indirect equity owner of such buyer that the indirect equity owner does not own more than a 9.9% (within the meaning of section 856(d)(2)(b) of the code) in a tenant described on schedule 1. these representations are made only with respect to the date hereof assuming the acquisitions have already taken place and do not constitute continuing representations or covenants with respect to the matters described in this section 3.1. 3.2 buyer and the company agree that buyer will provide the following information to the company and the company will provide the following information to buyer on an annual basis: (a) no later than december 31, of each calendar year, the company will update the information contained in schedule 1 (the "tenant list") and provide such information to buyer and to any indirect equity owner; (b) no later than 30 days after receipt of the tenant list, buyer 1 and buyer 2 and any indirect equity owner will inform the company of its direct equity ownership of any tenant in which it owns a 10% or greater equity interest (as described in code section 856(d)(2)(b)) and whose name appears on the tenant list; (c) no later than march 31, of each calendar year after 2000 (but only for so long as buyer owns or constructively owns at least 10% of the equity stock of the company), buyer shall deliver to the company, subject to such confidentiality restrictions as buyer may reasonably require, copies of the most recently received information regarding investments from (i) each partnership or limited liability company in which buyer or any indirect equity owner directly or indirectly holds an equity interest; and (ii) each corporation or trust in which buyer or any indirect equity owner directly or indirectly owns a 10% or greater equity interest (each such partnership, limited liability company, corporation or trust referred to as a "buyer entity"). in the alternative, buyer may satisfy the requirements of this section 3.2(c) by certifying to the company, not later than march 31 of each calendar year after 2000 (but only for so long as buyer owns or constructively owns at least 10% of the equity stock of the company), that buyer personnel have reviewed the information regarding investments of c-3 4 each buyer entity described in the preceding sentence together with the tenant list most recently provided by the company, and that such review has not revealed (except as specifically noted) any circumstances in which buyer, any indirect equity owner or any buyer entity would own (directly or constructively through the application of section 318 (as modified by code section 856(d)(5)) more than a 9.9% interest (as described in code section 856(d)(2)(b)) in any such tenant. 3.3 no later than 30 days after receipt of the tenant list, buyer shall provide the tenant list to each buyer entity and any indirect equity owner. buyer agrees and buyer will cause each buyer entity and indirect equity owner to agree that they will not acquire an equity interest in any of the tenants listed on the tenant list without the consent of the company. 4. miscellaneous 4.1 all questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the state of maryland, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision (whether of the state of maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of maryland. 4.2 this agreement may be signed by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so signed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. c-4 5 each of the parties has caused this agreement to be signed by its duly authorized officers as of the date forth in the introductory paragraph of this agreement. the

articles, such increase is contingent upon the execution by buyer of an excepted holder agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit a, the accuracy of buyer's representations and warranties contained in such excepted holder agreement and the completion of the transactions contemplated by the agreement; and (2) if at any time after the reit ownership date, under the constructive ownership rules of code section 856(h) and taking the common stock owned by buyer into account, an individual, as such term is defined in section 542(a)(2) of the code, would be treated as owning common stock in excess of such individual's common stock ownership limit in violation of section 7.2, the excess stock and other provisions of section 7.2 of the articles shall be applied first to the common stock
