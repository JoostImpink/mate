(a) subject to the provisions hereof, this warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, but not as to a fractional share, at any time or from time to time on or after the date hereof and on or before the expiration date, by presentation and surrender hereof to the issuer at the address which, in accordance with the notice provisions of section 10 hereof, is then effective for notices to the issuer, with the election to purchase form annexed hereto as schedule i, duly executed, for the account of the issuer, of the exercise price for the number of warrant shares specified in such form. if this warrant should be exercised in part only, the issuer shall, upon surrender of this warrant, execute and deliver a new warrant evidencing the rights of the holder hereof to purchase the balance of the warrant shares purchasable hereunder. the issuer shall maintain at its principal place of business a register (the "register") for the registration of this warrant and registration of any transfer or assignment in whole or in part of the warrant. (b) the exercise price for the number of warrant shares specified in the election to purchase form shall be payable in united states dollars by (i) certified or official bank check payable to the order of the issuer or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the issuer for that purpose, (ii) an election by the holder to have the issuer withhold shares of common stock issuable upon exercise (a "cashless exercise"), (iii) certificates representing shares of common stock theretofore owned by the holder duly endorsed for transfer to the issuer, or (iv) any combination of the preceding, equal in value to the aggregate exercise price. for purposes hereof, a cashless exercise shall be effected by surrendering the warrant, in part or in whole, for such number of warrant shares as is determined by dividing (1) the total exercise price payable in respect of the number of warrant shares being purchased upon such exercise by (2) the amount by which the fair market value per share of common stock as of the exercise date exceeds the exercise price per share.

(b) if the issuer declares a dividend on common stock, or makes a distribution to holders of common stock, and such dividend or distribution is payable or made in common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, or rights to purchase common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant may be exercised shall be increased, as of the record date for determining which holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding shares (and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all such securities convertible into common stock) of common stock as a result of such dividend or distribution, and the exercise price shall be adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price for the purchase of all the warrant shares issuable hereunder immediately after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall equal the aggregate exercise price so payable immediately before such record date.

(d) in case of any consolidation of the issuer with, or merger of the issuer into, any other corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the issuer is the continuing corporation and in which no change occurs in its outstanding common stock), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the issuer, or in the case of any statutory exchange of securities with another corporation (including any exchange effected in connection with a merger of a third corporation into the issuer, except where the issuer is the surviving entity and no change occurs in its outstanding common stock), the corporation formed by such consolidation or the corporation resulting from such merger or the corporation which shall have acquired such assets or securities of the issuer, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the holder simultaneously therewith a new warrant, satisfactory in form and substance to the holder, together with such other documents as the holder may reasonably request, entitling the holder thereof to receive upon exercise of such warrant the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, or exchange of securities, or upon the dissolution following such sale or other transfer, by a holder of the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, or exchange. such new warrant shall contain the same basic other terms and conditions as this warrant and shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such written instrument, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 5. the above provisions of this paragraph (d) shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, exchanges, sales or other transfers covered hereby. (e) if the issuer shall, at any time before the expiration of this warrant, dissolve, liquidate or wind up its affairs other than as covered by section 5(d), the holder shall, upon exercise of this warrant have the right to receive, in lieu of the shares of common stock of the issuer that the holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive, the same kind and amount of assets as would have been issued, distributed or paid to the holder upon any such dissolution, liquidation or winding up with respect to such shares of common stock of the issuer had the holder been the holder of record of such shares of common stock receivable upon exercise of this warrant on the date for determining those entitled to receive any such distribution. if any such dissolution, liquidation or winding up results in any cash distribution in excess of the aggregate exercise price provided by this warrant for the shares of common stock receivable upon exercise of this warrant, the holder may, at the holder's option, exercise this warrant without making payment of the exercise price and, in such case, the issuer shall, upon distribution to the holder, consider the exercise price to have been paid in full and, in making settlement to the holder, shall obtain receipt of the exercise price by deducting an amount equal to the exercise price for the shares of common stock receivable upon exercise of this warrant from the amount payable to the holder. for purposes of this paragraph, at holder's option, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the issuer and distribution of the proceeds thereof to the issuer's shareholders shall be deemed liquidation.

(g) if an event occurs which is similar in nature to the events described in this section 5, but is not expressly covered hereby, the board of directors of the issuer shall make or arrange for an equitable adjustment to the number of warrant shares and the exercise price. (h) the term "common stock" shall mean the common stock, $.00004 par value, of the issuer as the same exists at the date of issuance of this warrant or as such stock may be constituted from time to time, except that for the purpose of this section 5, the term "common stock" shall include any stock of any class of the issuer which has no preference in respect of dividends or of amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer and which is not subject to redemption by the issuer. (i) the issuer shall retain a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing (who may be any such firm regularly employed by the issuer) to make any computation required under this section 5, and a certificate signed by such firm shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of any computation made under this section 5 absent manifest error. (j) whenever the number of warrant shares or the exercise price shall be adjusted as required by the provisions of this section 5, the issuer forthwith shall file in the custody of its secretary or an assistant secretary, at its principal office, and furnish to each holder hereof, a certificate prepared in accordance with paragraph (h) above, showing the adjusted number of warrant shares and the exercise price and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances requiring the adjustments. (k) notwithstanding any other provision, this warrant shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors and assigns of the issuer. (l) no adjustment in the exercise price in accordance with the provisions of this section 5 need be made if such adjustment would amount to a change in such exercise price of less than $.01 provided however, that the amount by which any adjustment is not made by reason of the provisions of this paragraph (l) shall be carried forward and taken into account at the time of any subsequent adjustment in the exercise price. (m) if an adjustment is made under this section 5 and the event to which the adjustment relates does not occur, then any adjustments in accordance with this section 5 shall be readjusted to the exercise price and the number of warrant shares which would be in effect had the earlier adjustment not been made. section 6. taxes on issue or transfer of common stock and warrant. the issuer shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable solely in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock or other securities on the exercise of this warrant. the issuer shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer of this warrant or in respect of any transfers involved in the issue or delivery of shares or the exercise of this warrant in a name other than that of the holder and the person requesting such transfer, issue or delivery shall be responsible for the payment of any such tax (and the issuer shall not be required to issue or deliver said shares until such tax has been paid or provided for). section 7. notice of adjustment. . in case at any time: (a) the issuer shall declare any cash dividend on its common stock;

(g) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or winding up of the issuer; or (h) the issuer proposes to take any other action or an event occurs which would require an adjustment pursuant to subsection (i) of this section 7; then, in any one or more of said cases, the issuer shall give at least fifteen days' prior written notice, addressed to holder at the address of holder as shown on the books of the issuer, of (i) the date on which the books of the issuer shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or for determining rights to vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up; (ii) in the case of any issuance of capital at a price per share less than the then applicable exercise price, the date of such issuance and the number of shares issued; and (iii) in the case of any reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, winding up or other action, as the case may be, the date (or, if not then known, a reasonable approximation thereof by the issuer) when same shall take place. such notice shall also specify (or, if not then known, reasonably approximate), if applicable, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record shall participate in such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, winding up, or other action, as the case may be. section 8. no dilution or impairment. the issuer shall not, by amendment of its charter or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of holder against dilution or other impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the issuer will not increase the par value, if any, of any shares of stock receivable upon the exercise of any warrant above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise, and at all times will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the issuer may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable stock upon the exercise of each warrant. section 9. registration rights. section 3 of the investor rights agreement, dated as of july ___, 2001, between the issuer and the holder (the "investor rights agreement") is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof mutatis mutandis. section 10. representations and warranties of the issuer;

and whereas, it is a condition precedent to investor's willingness to consummate the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement and the development agreement that issuer shall have executed and delivered this agreement; now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as follows: section 1. certain defined terms. capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in the body hereof are used herein as defined in the subscription agreement. section 2. preemptive rights. if at any time prior to the third anniversary of the date first above written, issuer wishes to issue or otherwise transfer additional securities which, after giving effect to such transfer, would constitute less than fifty percent (50%) of the adjusted diluted shares (for purposes of this section, the "proposed transaction"), and as of the issue date (as defined below) investor holds no less than 333,333 shares of common stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like), issuer shall give investor and each transferee of investor of not fewer than 100,000 shares of common stock or securities convertible into orexercisable or exchangeable for not fewer than 100,000 shares of common stock (together with investor, the "rights holders") written notice thereof (for purposes of this section, an "offer notice") not fewer than sixty days prior to the date (for purposes of this section, the "issue date") on which issuer wishes to consummate the proposed transaction. the offer notice shall describe in reasonable detail: (iii) the voting powers, designations, preferences, and rights of, and qualifications, limitations, and restrictions with respect to, the securities issuer wishes to issue or otherwise transfer; and (iv) the price per share, unit, or face amount, as the case may be, at which, and all other material terms and conditions (including the expected issue date) upon which, issuer wishes to issue or otherwise transfer such securities. the offer notice shall constitute an offer by issuer to each rights holder to issue and sell to such rights holder the number of shares or units or the face amount, as the case may be, of the securities issuer wishes to issue or otherwise transfer (for purposes of this section, the "offered securities"), equal to the product of: (a) the aggregate number of shares or units or the aggregate face amount, as the case may be, of securities proposed to be issued in the proposed transaction; multiplied by (b) the quotient of: (1) the number of fully-diluted shares held by such rights holder as of the date of the offer notice; divided by (2) the total number of fully-diluted shares outstanding as of the date of the offer notice.

(ii) issued or issuable to any employee of issuer pursuant to any employee equity incentive plan approved by the board of directors of issuer; provided, however, that such exclusion shall only apply with respect to the issuance of securities that do not exceed fifteen percent (15%) in the aggregate of the then total outstanding securities on a fully-diluted basis;

provided that there must be included in such registration registrable securities with an anticipated aggregate offering price of not less than $250,000. following receipt of any notice under this section 3(a)(i), issuer shall: give written notice of such request to all other rights holders within ten business days;

(iv) issuer shall not be obligated to effect and pay for more than two registrations pursuant to this section 3(a); provided that a registration requested pursuant to this section 3(a) shall not be deemed to have been effected for purposes of this section 3(a) unless: (a) it has been declared effective by the commission; (b) it has remained effective for the period set forth in section 3(d)(i); (c) rights holders included in such registration have not withdrawn sufficient shares from such registration such that the remaining holders requesting registration would not have been able to request registration under the provisions of section 3(a)(i); and (d) the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such registration is not subject to any stop order, injunction, or other order or requirement of the commission (other than any such stop order, injunction, or other requirement of the commission prompted by any act or omission of any rights holders).

(ii) each rights holder requesting or joining in a registration severally and not jointly shall indemnify and hold harmless issuer, each of its directors and officers, each person, if any, who controls issuer within the meaning of the securities act, and each agent and any underwriter for issuer (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which issuer or any such director, officer, controlling person, agent, or underwriter may become subject, under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement on the effective date thereof (including any prospectus filed under rule 424 under the securities act or any amendments or supplements thereto) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such rights holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such rights holder shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by issuer or any such director, officer, controlling person, agent, or underwriter (but not in excess of expenses incurred in respect of one counsel for all of them unless there is an actual conflict of interest between any indemnified parties, which indemnified parties may be represented by separate counsel) in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 3(i)(ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such rights holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that the liability of each rights holder hereunder shall be limited to the proportion of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense which is equal to the proportion that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares sold by such rights holder under such registration statement bears to the total net proceeds from the sale of all securities sold thereunder, but not in any event to exceed the net proceeds received by such rights holder from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement. (iii) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 3(i) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 3(i), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with all fees and expenses thereof to be paid by such indemnified party, and to be apprised of all progress in any proceeding the defense of which has been assumed by the indemnifying party. the failure to notify an indemnifying party promptly of the commencement of any such action, if and to the extent prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 3(i), but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 3(i). (iv) to the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 3(i)(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (j) lockup. each rights holder shall, in connection with any registration of issuer's securities, upon the request of issuer or the underwriters managing any underwritten offering of issuer's securities, agree in writing not to effect any sale, disposition, or distribution of any registrable securities (other than that included in the registration) without the prior written consent of issuer or such underwriters, as the case may be, for such period of time not to exceed ninety days from the effective date of such registration as issuer or the underwriters may specify; provided, however, that all executive officers and directors of issuer and all of the significant stockholders of issuer also have agreed not to effect any sale, disposition, or distribution of any securities held thereby pursuant to any registration rights granted by issuer, under the circumstances and pursuant to the terms set forth in this section 3(j). (k) assignment of registration rights. each rights holder may assign its registration rights (and, in connection therewith, shall delegate its related obligations) hereunder with respect to any registrable securities to any transferee of such registrable securities; provided that: (i) the transferring rights holder shall promptly give issuer written notice of such assignment stating the name and address of the assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which the registration rights hereunder were assigned; (ii) such assignee agrees in writing to be bound as a rights holder by the provisions of this section 3; and (iii) immediately following such assignment the further disposition of such securities by such assignee is restricted under the securities act. except as set forth in this section 3(k), no transfer of registrable securities shall cause such registrable securities to lose such status.
