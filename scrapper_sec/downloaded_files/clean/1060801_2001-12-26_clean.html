"indemnifying party") agrees to indemnify, defend ------------------ and hold harmless each of the purchasers and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, partners, members and controlling persons (each, an "indemnified party") to the fullest extent ----------------- permitted by law from and against any and all losses, claims, or written threats thereof (including, without limitation, any claim by a third party), damages, expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or between the indemnified party and any third party or otherwise) or other liabilities (collectively, "losses") resulting from or ------ arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by the company in this agreement, the stockholders agreement, the escrow agreement or the 25 warrants. the amount of any payment to any indemnified party herewith in respect of any loss shall be of sufficient amount to make such indemnified party whole for any diminution in value of the subject shares directly caused by such breach. in connection with the obligation of the indemnifying party to indemnify for expenses as set forth above, the indemnifying party shall, upon presentation of appropriate invoices containing reasonable detail, reimburse each indemnified party for all such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party or between the indemnified party and any third party) as they are incurred by such indemnified party; provided, -------- however, that if an indemnified party is reimbursed under this article vii for - ------- any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the losses in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such indemnified party. 7.2 notification. each indemnified party under this article ------------ vii shall, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any claim against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the indemnifying party under this article vii, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof. the omission of any indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party of any such action shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party (a) other than pursuant to this article vii or (b) under this article vii unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the indemnifying party's forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses. in case any such claim shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party in its reasonable judgment; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense at its own expense. notwithstanding the foregoing, in any claim in which both the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and an indemnified party, on the other hand, are, or are reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to control its own defense of such claim if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, either (x) one or more defenses are available to the indemnified party that are not available to the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, that would make such separate representation advisable; provided, however, that the indemnifying party (i) shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel to all indemnified parties and (ii) shall reimburse the indemnified parties for all of such fees and expenses of such counsel incurred in any action between the indemnifying party and the indemnified parties or between the indemnified parties and any third party, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that if an indemnified party is reimbursed under -------- ------- this article vii for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally judicially determined that the losses in question resulted primarily from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such indemnified party. the indemnifying party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened 26 claim relating to the matters contemplated hereby (if any indemnified party is a party thereto or has been actually threatened to be made a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected against an indemnified party without the indemnifying party's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the rights accorded to an indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to any rights that any indemnified party may have at common law, by separate agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to -------- ------- the contrary contained in this agreement, nothing in this article vii shall restrict or limit any rights that any indemnified party may have to seek equitable relief. 7.3 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this ------------ article vii from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 7.1 and 7.2, any reasonable legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. article viii affirmative covenants --------------------- the company hereby covenants and agrees with the purchasers as follows: 8.1 financial

(b) incidental or "piggy-back" rights with respect to a demand ---------------------------------------------------------- registration. each of the designated holders (other than initiating holders - ------------ which have requested a registration under section 3(a)) may offer its or his registrable securities under any demand registration pursuant to this section 3(b). within five (5) days after the receipt of a request for a demand registration from an initiating holder, the company shall (i) give written notice thereof to all of the designated holders (other than initiating holders which have requested a registration under section 3(a)) and (ii) subject to section 3(e), include in such registration all of the registrable securities held by such designated holders from whom the company has received a written request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days of the receipt by such designated holders of such written notice referred to in clause (i) above. each such request by such designated holders shall specify the number of registrable securities proposed to be registered. the failure of any designated holder to respond within such 10 day period referred to in clause (ii) above shall be deemed to be a waiver of such designated holder's rights under this section 3 with respect to such demand registration. any designated holder may waive its rights under this section 3 prior to the expiration of such 10-day period by giving written notice to the company, with a copy to the initiating holders. if a designated holder sends the company a written request for inclusion of part or all of such designated holder's registrable securities in a registration, such designated holder shall not be entitled to withdraw or revoke such request without the prior written consent of the company in its sole discretion unless, as a result of facts or circumstances arising after the date on which such request was made relating to the company or to market conditions, such designated holder reasonably determines that participation in such registration would have a material adverse effect on such designated holder. (c) effective demand registration. the company shall use all ----------------------------- commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such demand registration to be filed not later than thirty (30) days after it receives a request under section 3(a) hereof and to become and remain effective as soon as practicable thereafter but, in any event, not later than ninety (90) days after such filing. a registration shall not constitute a demand registration until it has become effective and remains continuously effective for the lesser of (i) the period during which all registrable securities registered in the demand registration are sold and (ii) 120 days; provided, however, that a registration shall not -------- ------- 7 constitute a demand registration if (x) after such demand registration has become effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or distribution of registrable securities thereunder is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the initiating holders and such interference is not thereafter eliminated or (y) the conditions specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such demand registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure by the initiating holder. (d) expenses. the company shall pay all registration expenses in -------- connection with a demand registration, whether or not such demand registration becomes effective. (e) underwriting procedures. ----------------------- (i) if the company or the initiating holders holding a majority of the registrable securities held by all of the initiating holders so elect, the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such demand registration to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be the approved underwriter selected in accordance with section 3(f). in connection with any demand registration under this section 3 involving an underwritten offering, none of the registrable securities held by any designated holder making a request for inclusion of such registrable securities pursuant to section 3(b) hereof shall be included in such underwritten offering unless such designated holder accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the company, the initiating holders and the approved underwriter, and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the approved underwriter, jeopardize the success of such offering by the initiating holders. if the approved underwriter advises the company in its reasonable opinion that the aggregate amount of such registrable securities requested to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the success of such offering, then the company shall include in such registration only the aggregate amount of registrable securities that the approved underwriter believes may be sold without any such material adverse effect and shall reduce the amount of registrable securities to be included in such registration by removing from such registration securities owned, first by the company and ----- second by the designated holders (including the initiating holders) pro rata - ------ based on the number of registrable securities owned by each such designated holder. (ii) if an initiating holder makes a request for a demand registration and, pursuant to section 3(e)(i) above, the approved underwriter advises the company to reduce the aggregate amount of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering such that less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the registrable securities requested to be included by any initiating holder are ultimately included in and sold pursuant to such demand registration, the initiating holder shall have the right to require the company to effect an additional demand registration; provided, however, that in no event -------- ------- shall the aggregate number of demand registrations to be effected by the company for any one initiating holder exceed two (2). 8 (f) selection of underwriters. if any demand registration of ------------------------- registrable securities is in the form of an underwritten offering, the company shall select and obtain an investment banking firm of national reputation to act as the managing underwriter of the offering (the "approved underwriter"); -------------------- provided, however, that the approved underwriter shall, in any case, also be - -------- ------- approved by the initiating holders. 4. incidental or "piggy-back" registration. --------------------------------------- (a) request for incidental registration. if at any time the ----------------------------------- company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering by the company for its own account (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor thereto) or for the account of any stockholder of the company other than the designated holders, then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to each of the designated holders at least twenty (20) days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall describe the proposed registration and distribution and offer such designated holders the opportunity to register the number of registrable securities as each such designated holder may request (an "incidental registration"). the company shall use all commercially reasonable ----------------------- efforts (within twenty (20) days of the notice provided for in the preceding sentence) to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of a proposed underwritten offering (the "company underwriter") to permit each of the ------------------- designated holders who have requested in writing to participate in the incidental registration to include its or his registrable securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the securities of the company or the account of such other stockholder, as the case may be, included therein. in connection with any incidental registration under this section 4(a) involving an underwritten offering, the company shall not be required to include any registrable securities in such underwritten offering unless the designated holders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon between the company, such other stockholders, if any, and the company underwriter, and then only in such quantity as the company underwriter believes will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the company. if the company underwriter determines that the registration of all or part of the registrable securities which the designated holders have requested to be included would materially adversely affect the success of such offering, then the company shall be required to include in such incidental registration, to the extent of the amount that the company underwriter believes may be sold without causing such adverse effect, first, all of the securities to be offered for the account of ----- the company or on the account of the selling stockholder that caused the registration statement that has triggered the incidental registration to be filed, as the case may be; second, the registrable securities to be offered for ------ the account of the designated holders pursuant to this section 4, pro rata based on the number of registrable securities owned by each such designated holder; and third, any other securities requested to be included in such offering. ----- (b) expenses. the company shall bear all registration expenses -------- in connection with any incidental registration pursuant to this section 4, whether or not such incidental registration becomes effective. 9 5. holdback agreements. ------------------- (a) restrictions on public sale by designated holders. to the ------------------------------------------------- extent (i) requested (a) by the company or the initiating holders, as the case may be, in the case of a non-underwritten public offering and (b) by the approved underwriter or the company underwriter, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten public offering and (ii) all of the company's officers, directors and holders in excess of one percent (1%) of its outstanding capital stock execute agreements identical to those referred to in this section 5(a), each designated holder agrees (x) not to effect any public sale or distribution of any registrable securities or of any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such registrable securities, including a sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, or offer to sell, contract to sell (including without limitation any short sale), grant any option to purchase or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a public sale any registrable securities and (y) not to make any request for a demand registration under this agreement, during the ninety (90) day period or such shorter period, if any, mutually agreed upon by such designated holder and the requesting party beginning on the effective date of the registration statement (except as part of such registration) for such public offering. no designated holder of registrable securities subject to this section 5(a) shall be released from any obligation under any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into pursuant to this section 5(a) unless all other designated holders of registrable securities subject to the same obligation are also released. all designated holders of registrable securities shall be automatically released from any obligations under any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into pursuant to this section 5(a) immediately upon the expiration of the 90 day period. (b) restrictions on public sale by the company. the company ------------------------------------------ agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of its securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities (except pursuant to registrations on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor thereto), during the period beginning on the effective date of any registration statement in which the designated holders of registrable securities are participating and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which all registrable securities registered on such registration statement are sold and (ii) 120 days after the effective date of such registration statement (except as part of such registration). 6. registration procedures. ----------------------- (a) obligations of the company. whenever registration of -------------------------- registrable securities has been requested pursuant to section 3 or section 4 of this agreement, the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable, and in connection with any such request, the company shall, as expeditiously as possible: (i) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies or which counsel for the 10 company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and cause such registration statement to become effective; provided, however, that (x) before filing a registration statement or prospectus - -------- ------- or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company shall provide counsel selected by the designated holders holding a majority of the registrable securities being registered in such registration ("holders' counsel") with an ---------------- adequate opportunity to review and comment on such registration statement and each prospectus included therein (and each amendment or supplement thereto) to be filed with the commission, subject to such documents being under the company's control, and (y) the company shall notify the holders' counsel and each seller of registrable securities of any stop order issued or threatened by the commission and take all action required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered;

(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this ------------ section 7 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in sections 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c), any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided that the -------- total amount to be contributed by such designated holder shall be limited to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions) received by such designated holder in the offering. 16 the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 8. rule 144. the company covenants that it shall (a) file any -------- reports required to be filed by it under the exchange act and (b) take such further action as each designated holder may reasonably request (including providing any information necessary to comply with rule 144 under the securities act), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such designated holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time or (ii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the commission. the company shall, upon the request of any designated holder, deliver to such designated holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 9. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) recapitalizations, exchanges, etc. the provisions of --------------------------------- this agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to (i) the shares of common stock, (ii) any and all shares of voting common stock of the company into which the shares of common stock are converted, exchanged or substituted in any recapitalization or other capital reorganization by the company and (iii) any and all equity securities of the company or any successor or assign of the company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in conversion of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the shares of common stock and shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof. the company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any successor or assign (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) to enter into a new registration rights agreement with the designated holders on terms substantially the same as this agreement as a condition of any such transaction. (b) no inconsistent agreements. the company shall not enter -------------------------- into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the designated holders in this agreement or grant any additional registration rights to any person or with respect to any securities which are not registrable securities which are prior in right to or inconsistent with the rights granted in this agreement.
