permitted by applicable law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or

excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each bank receiving in respect of the obligations held by it its proportionate payment as contemplated by this agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such bank, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. &#167;14. the agent . &#167;14.1 authorization . the agent is authorized to take such action on behalf of each of the banks and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder and under any of the other loan documents and any related documents delegated to the agent, together with such powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the agent. the obligations of agent hereunder are primarily administrative in nature, and nothing contained in this agreement, or any of the other loan documents shall be construed to constitute the agent as a trustee for any bank or to create any agency or fiduciary relationship. agent shall act as the contractual representative of the banks hereunder, and notwithstanding the use of the term &#147;agent&#148;, it is understood and agreed that the agent shall not

no liability . neither the agent nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other person assisting them in their duties nor any agent, or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted 33 to be taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other loan documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the agent or such other person, as the case may be, shall be liable for losses due to its willful misconduct or gross negligence. the agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any default or event of default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the agent for the account of the banks, unless the agent has received notice from a bank or the borrowers referring to the loan documents and describing with reasonable specificity such default or event of default and stating that such notice is a &#147;notice of default&#148;. &#167;14.4 no representations . the agent shall not be responsible for the execution or validity or enforceability of this agreement, the notes, any of the other loan documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made herein, or any agreement, instrument or certificate delivered in connection therewith or in any of the other loan documents or in any certificate or instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of the borrowers or the guarantor, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or in any other of the loan documents. the agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by the borrowers or the guarantor or any holder of any of the notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. the agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the banks, with respect to the creditworthiness or financial condition of the borrowers or the guarantor or the value of the collateral. each bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the agent or any other bank, and based upon such information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this agreement. each bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the agent or any other bank, based upon such information and documents as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this agreement and the other loan documents. agent&#146;s special counsel has only represented agent and keybank in connection with the loan documents and the only attorney-client relationship or duty of care is between agent&#146;s special counsel and agent or keybank. each bank has been independently represented by separate counsel on all matters regarding the loan documents and the granting and perfecting of liens in the collateral. &#167;14.5 payments . (a) a payment by the borrowers or the guarantor to the agent hereunder or under any of the other loan documents for the account of any bank shall constitute a payment to such bank. the agent agrees to distribute to each bank not later than one business day after the agent&#146;s receipt of good funds, determined in accordance with the agent&#146;s customary practices, such bank&#146;s pro rata share of payments received by the agent for the account of the banks except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any of the other loan documents. in the event that the agent fails to distribute such amounts within one business day as provided above, the agent shall pay interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the federal funds effective rate from time to time in effect. 34 (b) if in the opinion of the agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the notes or under any of the other loan documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. if a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the agent is to be repaid, each person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the agent its proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such persons as shall be determined by such court. (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement or any of the other loan documents, any bank that fails (i) to make available to the agent its pro rata share of any loan, (ii) to comply with the provisions of &#167;13 with respect to making dispositions and arrangements with the other banks, where such bank&#146;s share of any payment received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in excess of its pro rata share of such payments due and payable to all of the banks, in each case as, when and to the full extent required by the provisions of this agreement, or (iii) to perform any other obligation within the time period specified for performance, or if no time period is specified, if such failure continues for a period of five (5) business days after notice from the agent, shall be deemed delinquent (a &#147;delinquent bank&#148;) and shall be deemed a delinquent bank until such time as such delinquency is satisfied. in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to the agent at law and in equity, a delinquent bank&#146;s right to participate in the administration of the loan documents, including, without limitation, any rights to consent to or direct any action or inaction of the agent pursuant to this agreement or otherwise, or to be taken into account in the calculation of majority banks or any matter requiring approval of all of the banks, shall be suspended while such bank is a delinquent bank. a delinquent bank shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the borrowers and the guarantor, whether on account of outstanding loans, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent banks for application to, and reduction of, their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding loans. the delinquent bank hereby authorizes the agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent banks in proportion to their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding loans. the provisions of this section shall apply and be effective regardless of whether an event of default occurs and is then continuing, and notwithstanding (i) any other provision of this agreement to the contrary or (ii) any instruction of borrowers as to their desired application of payments. the agent shall be entitled to (i) withhold or set off, and to apply to the payment of the obligations of any delinquent bank any amounts to be paid to such delinquent bank under this agreement, (ii) to collect interest from such bank for the period from the date on which the payment was due at the rate per annum equal to the federal funds effective rate plus two percent (2%), for each day during such period, and (iii) bring an action or suit against such delinquent bank in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted obligations of such delinquent bank. a delinquent bank shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding loans of the nondelinquent banks or as a result of other payments by the delinquent banks to the nondelinquent banks, the banks&#146; respective pro rata shares of all outstanding loans have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency. &#167;14.6 holders of notes . subject to the terms of article 18, the agent may deem and treat the payee of any note as the absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof 35 until it shall have been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent holder, assignee or transferee. &#167;14.7 indemnity . the banks ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless the agent from and against any and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which the agent has not been reimbursed by the borrowers as required by &#167;15), and liabilities of every nature and character arising out of or related to this agreement, the notes or any of the other loan documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the agent&#146;s actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused by the agent&#146;s willful misconduct or gross negligence. &#167;14.8 agent as bank . in its individual capacity, the bank acting as the agent shall have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its commitment and the loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the notes as it would have were it not also the agent. &#167;14.9 resignation . subject to the terms of &#167;18.1, the agent may resign at any time by giving 30 calendar days&#146; prior written notice thereof to the banks and the borrowers. upon any such resignation, the majority banks, subject to the terms of &#167;18.1, shall have the right to appoint as a successor agent any bank or any bank whose senior debt obligations are rated not less than &#147;a&#148; or its equivalent by moody&#146;s investors service, inc. or not less than &#147;a&#148; or its equivalent by standard &amp; poor&#146;s ratings services and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000. unless an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the borrowers. if no successor agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring agent&#146;s giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring agent may, on behalf of the banks, appoint a successor agent, which shall be any bank or a bank whose debt obligations are rated not less than &#147;a&#148; or its equivalent by moody&#146;s investors service, inc. or not less than &#147;a&#148; or its equivalent by standard &amp; poor&#146;s ratings services and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000. upon the acceptance of any appointment as agent hereunder by a successor agent, such successor agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed agent, and the retiring agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder as agent. after any retiring agent&#146;s resignation, the provisions of this agreement and the other loan documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as agent. upon any change in the agent under this agreement, the resigning agent shall execute such assignments of and amendments to the loan documents as may be necessary to substitute the successor agent for the resigning agent. &#167;14.10 duties in the case of enforcement . in case one or more events of default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not acceleration of the obligations shall have occurred, the agent may and, if so requested by the majority banks and the banks have provided to the agent such additional indemnities and assurances in accordance with their respective commitment percentages against expenses and liabilities as the agent may reasonably request, shall proceed to exercise all or any legal and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have; provided, however, that unless and until the agent shall have received such directions, the agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such default or event of default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the 36 banks. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if agent reasonably determines payment is in the best interest of all the banks, agent may (but shall not be obligated to) without the approval of the banks take such actions and pay such amounts as agent reasonably deems necessary to protect the collateral. each bank shall, within thirty (30) days of request therefor, pay to the agent its commitment percentage of the reasonable costs incurred by the agent in taking any such actions hereunder to the extent that such costs shall not be promptly reimbursed to the agent by the borrowers or out of the collateral within such period. the majority banks may direct the agent in writing as to the method and the extent of any such exercise, the banks hereby agreeing to indemnify and hold the agent harmless in accordance with their respective commitment percentages from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, provided that the agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent that the agent reasonably believes the agent&#146;s compliance with such direction to be unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction or commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction. &#167;14.11 bankruptcy . in the event a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against a borrower or the guarantor with respect to the obligations, the agent shall have the sole and exclusive right to file and pursue a

extent permitted by law, any other legal, equitable or surety defenses whatsoever to which borrowers might otherwise be entitled, it being the intention that the obligations of borrowers hereunder are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable. each borrower understands that the exercise by agent of certain rights and remedies may affect or eliminate such borrower&#146;s right of subrogation against the other borrower or the guarantor and that such borrower may therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability hereunder. nevertheless, borrowers hereby authorize and empower agent, its successors, endorsees and assigns, to exercise in its or their sole discretion, any rights and remedies, or any combination thereof, which may then be available, it being the purpose and intent of borrowers that the obligations hereunder shall be absolute, continuing, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement or the other loan documents to the contrary, each borrower hereby waives and releases any claim or other rights which such borrower may now have or hereafter acquire against the other borrower or guarantor or any other person of all or any of the obligations of borrowers hereunder that arise from the existence or performance of such borrower&#146;s obligations under this agreement or any of the other loan documents, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of agent and the banks against the borrowers or guarantor or other person or any collateral which agent now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the borrowers or guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights, except for those rights of each borrower under the contribution agreement; provided, however, each borrower agrees not to pursue or enforce any of its rights under the contribution agreement and each borrower agrees not to make or receive any payment on account of the contribution agreement so long as any of the obligations or the hedge obligations remain unpaid or undischarged. in the event any borrower shall receive any payment under or on account of the contribution agreement, it shall hold such payment as trustee for agent and the banks and be paid over to agent and the banks on account of the indebtedness of borrowers to agent and the banks and the hedge obligations but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of borrowers under the other provisions of the loan documents except to the extent the principal amount or other portion of such indebtedness shall have been reduced by such payment. without limitation on the generality of the other waivers contained in this agreement, each borrower hereby waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the agent, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed or otherwise impaired such borrower&#146;s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the 49 principal (whether by the operation of any provision of the california code of civil procedure or otherwise). in addition, each borrower hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced, dependent upon or affected by, and hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any defense based on, any one or more of the following: (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of, or the existence of any default with respect to, the obligations or the hedge obligations, any security therefor, or any related instrument, documents, obligation, transaction or matter; (ii) the nature, extent, condition, value or continued existence of any security given in connection with the obligations or the hedge obligations; (iii) any action or failure to take action by any holder of the obligations or the hedge obligations under or with respect to the loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations, any security therefor, or any related documents, transaction or matter; (iv) any other dealings between any holder of the obligations or the hedge obligations and agent and the banks; (v) any exculpatory language or provisions limiting or restricting agent&#146;s rights or remedies against the borrowers or any other person under the loan documents; or (vi) any claim by or on behalf of borrowers of any credit or right of setoff with respect to the note or any of the obligations or the hedge obligations. &#167;34.5 waiver . each of the borrowers waives, to the fullest extent that each may lawfully so do, the benefit of all appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, homestead, exemption and redemption laws which such person may claim or seek to take advantage of in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of any of the loan documents or the exercise by the banks or agent of any of their respective remedies under the loan documents and, to the fullest extent that the borrowers may lawfully so do, such person waives any and all right to have the assets comprised in the security intended to be created by the security documents (including, without limitation, those assets owned by the other of the borrowers) marshaled upon any foreclosure of the lien created by such security documents. each of the borrowers further agrees that the banks and agent shall be entitled to exercise their respective rights and remedies under the loan documents or at law or in equity in such order as they may elect. without limiting the foregoing, each of the borrowers further agrees that upon the occurrence of an event of default, the banks and agent may exercise any of such rights and remedies without notice to either of the borrowers except as required by law or the loan documents and agrees that neither the banks nor agent shall be required to proceed against the other of the borrowers or any other person or to proceed against or to exhaust any other security held by the banks or agent at any time or to pursue any other remedy in bank&#146;s or agent&#146;s power or under any of the loan documents before proceeding against a borrower or its assets under the loan documents. &#167;34.6 subordination . each of the borrowers hereby expressly waives any right of contribution from or indemnity against the other, whether at law or in equity, arising from any payments made by such person pursuant to the terms of this agreement or the loan documents, and each of the borrowers acknowledges that it has no right whatsoever to proceed against the other for reimbursement of any such payments. in connection with the foregoing, each of the borrowers expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation to the banks or agent against the other of the borrowers, and each of the borrowers hereby waives any rights to enforce any remedy which the banks or agent may have against the other of the borrowers and any rights to participate in any collateral or any other assets of the other borrower. notwithstanding the foregoing, the borrowers shall be entitled to the rights and benefits set forth in the contribution 50 agreement. in addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the borrowers hereby subordinates any and all indebtedness it may now or hereafter owe to such other borrower to all indebtedness of the borrowers to the banks and agent, and agrees with the banks and agent that neither of the borrowers shall claim any offset or other reduction of such borrower&#146;s obligations hereunder because of any such indebtedness and shall not take any action to obtain any of the collateral or any other assets of the other borrower.

(a) upon the occurrence of any event of default, agent may take any action deemed by agent to be necessary or appropriate to the enforcement of the rights and remedies of agent under this assignment and the loan documents, including, without limitation, the exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to any or all of the collateral. the remedies of agent shall include, without limitation, all rights and remedies specified in the loan documents and this assignment, all remedies of agent under applicable general or statutory law, and the remedies of a secured party under the ucc, regardless of whether the ucc has been enacted or enacted in that form in any other jurisdiction in which such right or remedy is asserted. in addition to such other remedies as may exist from time to time, whether by way of set-off, banker&#146;s lien, consensual security interest or otherwise, upon the occurrence of an event of default, agent is authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to or demand upon assignor (any such notice or demand being expressly waived by assignor ) to charge any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by agent to or for the credit of or the account of assignor against any and all of the obligations, irrespective of whether or not agent shall have made any demand for payment and although such obligations may be unmatured. any notice required by law, including, but not limited to, notice of the intended disposition of all or any portion of the collateral, shall be reasonable and properly given if given in the manner prescribed for the giving of notice herein, and, in the case of any notice of disposition, if given at least ten (10) days prior to such disposition. agent may require assignor to assemble the collateral and make it available to agent at any place to be designated by agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties. it is expressly understood and agreed that agent shall be entitled to dispose of the collateral at any public or private sale or sales, without recourse to judicial proceedings and without either demand, appraisement, advertisement or notice (except as such notice as is 12 otherwise required under this assignment) of any kind, all of which are expressly waived, and that agent shall be entitled to bid and purchase at any such sale. in the event that agent is the successful bidder at any public or private sale of any note or other document or instrument evidencing assignor&#146;s right to receive a distribution, agent shall be entitled to credit the amount bid by agent against the obligations evidenced by such note, document or instrument rather than the obligations evidenced by the note. to the extent the collateral consists of marketable securities, agent shall not be obligated to sell such securities for the highest price obtainable, but shall sell them at the market price available on the date of sale. agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of the collateral if it shall determine not to do so regardless of the fact that notice of sale of the collateral may have been given. agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the collateral sold absolutely free from claim or right on the part of assignor. in the event that any consent, approval or authorization of any governmental agency or commission will be necessary to effectuate any such sale or sales, assignor shall execute all such applications or other instruments as agent may deem reasonably necessary to obtain such consent, approval or authorization. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, agent may notify any account debtor or obligor with respect to the collateral to make payment directly to agent, and may demand, collect, receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon the collateral as agent may determine whether or not the obligations or the collateral are due, and for the purpose of realizing agent&#146;s rights therein, agent may receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to assignor and endorse notes, checks, drafts, money orders, documents of title or other evidences of payment, shipment or storage of any form of collateral on behalf and in the name of assignor, as its attorney-in-fact. in addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints agent its true and lawful attorney-in-fact either in the name of agent or assignor to (i) sign assignor&#146;s name on any collateral, drafts against account debtors, assignments, any proof of claim in any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding involving any account debtor, any notice of lien, claim of lien or assignment or satisfaction of lien, or on any financing statement or continuation statement under the ucc; (ii) send verifications of accounts receivable to any account debtor; and (iii) in connection with a transfer of the collateral as described above, sign in assignor&#146;s name any documents necessary to transfer title to the collateral to agent or any third party. all acts of said attorney-in-fact are hereby ratified and approved and agent shall not be liable for any mistake of law or fact made in connection therewith. this power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any amounts remain unpaid on any of the obligations. all remedies of agent shall be cumulative to the full extent provided by law, all without liability except to account for property actually received, but the agent shall have no duty to exercise such rights and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. pursuit by agent of certain judicial or other remedies shall not abate nor bar other remedies with respect to the obligations or to other portions of the collateral. agent may exercise its rights to the collateral without resorting or regard to other collateral or sources of security or reimbursement for the obligations. in the event that any transfer tax, deed tax, conveyance tax or similar tax is payable in connection with the foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise of the shareholder interests or other collateral, assignor shall pay such amount to agent upon demand and if assignor fails to pay such amount on demand, agent 13 may advance such amount on behalf of assignor and the amount thereof shall become a part of the obligations and bear interest at the rate for overdue amounts as set forth in the loan agreement until paid. (b) if assignor fails to perform any agreement or covenant contained in this assignment beyond any applicable period for notice and cure, agent may itself perform, or cause to be performed, any agreement or covenant of assignor contained in this assignment which assignor shall fail to perform, and the cost of such performance, together with any expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees actually incurred (including attorneys&#146; fees incurred in any appeal) by agent in connection therewith, shall be payable by assignor upon demand and shall constitute a part of the obligations and shall bear interest at the rate for overdue amounts as set forth in the loan agreement. (c) whether or not an event of default has occurred and whether or not agent is the absolute owner of the collateral, agent may take such action as agent may deem necessary to protect the collateral or its security interest therein, agent being hereby authorized to pay, purchase, contest and compromise any encumbrance, charge or lien which in the reasonable judgment of agent appears to be prior or superior to its security interest, and in exercising any such powers and authority to pay necessary expenses, employ counsel and pay reasonable attorney&#146;s fees. any such advances made or expenses incurred by agent shall be deemed advanced under the loan documents, shall increase the indebtedness evidenced and secured thereby, shall be payable upon demand and shall bear interest at the rate for overdue payments set forth in the loan agreement. (d) any stock or securities and stock powers held by agent as collateral (including stock certificates) hereunder may, at any time, and at the option of agent, be registered in the name of agent or its nominee, endorsed or assigned in blank or in the name of any nominee and agent may deliver any or all of the collateral to the issuer or issuers thereof for the purpose of making denominational exchanges or registrations or transfer or for such other purposes in furtherance of this assignment as agent may deem desirable. until the occurrence of an event of default, assignor shall retain the right to vote any of the collateral, as applicable, or exercise shareholder rights, as applicable, in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of this assignment and the other loan documents, and agent hereby grants to assignor its proxy to enable assignor to so vote any of the collateral or exercise such shareholder rights, as applicable, (except that assignor shall not have any right to exercise any such power if the exercise thereof would violate or result in a violation of any of the terms of this assignment or any of the other loan documents). at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, agent or its nominee shall, without notice or demand, automatically have the sole and exclusive right to give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the collateral and exercise all voting and other shareholder, management, approval or other rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the corporations, (and the right to call such meetings) or otherwise (and to give written consents in lieu of voting thereon), and exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any of the rights, privileges or options pertaining to the collateral and otherwise act with respect thereto and thereunder as if agent or its nominee were the absolute owner thereof (all of such rights of assignor ceasing to exist and terminating upon the occurrence of an event of default) including, without limitation, the right to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of the collateral upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, 14 recapitalization or the readjustment of the issuer thereof, all without liability except to account for property actually received and in such manner as agent shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion, but agent shall have no duty to exercise any of the aforesaid rights, privileges or options and shall not be responsible for the failure to do so or delay in so doing. the exercise by agent of any of its rights and remedies under this paragraph shall not be deemed a disposition of collateral under article 9 of the ucc nor an acceptance by agent of any of the collateral in satisfaction of the obligations. (e) notwithstanding anything in this assignment or any other loan document to the contrary, any reference in this assignment or any other loan document to &#147;the continuance of a default&#148; or &#147;the continuance of an event of default&#148; or any similar phrase shall not create or be deemed to create any right of assignor or any other party to cure any default following the expiration of any applicable grace or notice and cure period. 10. duties of agent . the powers conferred on agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. agent&#146;s duty with reference to the collateral shall be solely to use slight care in the custody and preservation of the collateral, which shall not include any steps necessary to preserve rights against prior parties and to use such care in the custody of collateral in the possession of agent as is accorded to other personal property of the same type as the collateral in the possession of the agent. agent shall have no responsibility or liability for the collection of any collateral or by reason of any invalidity, lack of value or uncollectability of any of the payments received by it. 11. indemnification . (a) it is specifically understood and agreed that this assignment shall not operate to place any responsibility or obligation whatsoever upon the agent or any of the lenders, or cause the agent or any of the lenders to be, or to be deemed to be, a shareholder in any of the corporations and that in accepting this assignment, the agent and the lenders neither assume nor agree to perform at any time whatsoever any obligation or duty of assignor relating to the collateral or under any of the organizational agreements or any other mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement or instrument to which the corporations are a party or to which they are subject, all of which obligations and duties shall be and remain with and upon the assignor. (b) assignor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the agent and the lenders harmless from and against any and all claims, expenses, losses and liabilities growing out of or resulting from this assignment or acts taken or omitted to be taken by the agent or the lenders hereunder or in connection therewith (including, without limitation, enforcement of this assignment), except claims, expenses, losses or liabilities resulting from agent&#146;s or such lender&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. (c) assignor upon demand shall pay to agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel actually incurred (including those incurred in any appeal), and of any experts and agents, which agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this assignment, (ii) the sale 15 of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of agent hereunder, or (iv) the failure by assignor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. 12. security interest absolute . all rights of agent, and the security interests hereunder, and all of the obligations secured hereby, shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the loan documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time (including the extension of the maturity date of the note), manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the loan documents; (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any other collateral for the obligations, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any of the loan documents with respect to all or any part of the obligations; or (d) any other circumstance (other than payment of the obligations in full) that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, assignor or any third party for the obligations or any part thereof. 13. amendments and waivers . no amendment or waiver of any provision of this assignment nor consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. no delay or omission of agent to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon any event of default shall exhaust or impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such event of default, or acquiescence therein; and every right, power and remedy given by this assignment to agent may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by agent. failure on the part of agent to complain of any act or failure to act which constitutes an event of default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by agent of agent&#146;s rights hereunder or impair any rights, powers or remedies consequent on any event of default. assignor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law all rights which assignor has or may have under and by virtue of the ucc and any federal, state, county or municipal statute, regulation, ordinance, constitution or charter, now or hereafter existing, similar in effect thereto providing any right of assignor to notice and to a judicial hearing prior to seizure by agent of any of the collateral. assignor hereby waives and renounces for itself, its heirs, successors and assigns, presentment, demand, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except for any notice required by law or the loan documents) and all rights to the benefits of any statute of limitations and any moratorium, reinstatement, marshaling, forbearance, valuation, stay, extension, homestead, redemption and appraisement now provided or which may hereafter be provided by the constitution and laws of the united states and of any state thereof, both as to itself and in and to all of its property, real and personal, against the enforcement of this assignment and the collection of any of the obligations. 16 14. continuing security interest; transfer of note; release of collateral . this assignment shall create a continuing security interest in the collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations and the lenders have no further obligation to make any advances under the note, (b) be binding upon assignor and its permitted heirs, successors and assigns, and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of agent hereunder, to the benefit of the agent and the lenders and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. upon the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations and the termination or expiration of any obligation of the lenders to make further advances under the note, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the collateral shall revert to the assignor that granted such security interest. upon any such termination, agent will, at assignor&#146;s expense, execute and deliver to assignor such documents as assignor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. 15. modifications, etc . assignor hereby consents and agrees that agent may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent from assignor, either with or without consideration, surrender any property or other security of any kind or nature whatsoever held by it or by any person, firm or corporation on its behalf or for its account, securing the obligations; substitute for any collateral so held by it, other collateral of like kind; agree to modification of the terms of the loan documents; extend or renew the loan documents for any period; grant releases, compromises and indulgences with respect to the loan documents for any period or to any persons or entities now or hereafter liable thereunder or hereunder; release any guarantor, endorser or any other person or entity liable with respect to the obligations; or take or fail to take any action of any type whatsoever; and no such action which agent shall take or fail to take in connection with the loan documents, or any of them, or any security for the payment of the obligations or for the performance of any obligations or undertakings of assignor, nor any course of dealing with assignor or any other person, shall release assignor&#146;s obligations hereunder, affect this assignment in any way or afford assignor any recourse against agent. 16. securities act and other limitations . in view of the position of assignor in relation to the collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the securities laws or the organizational agreements of the corporations, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement with respect to any disposition of the collateral permitted hereunder (including, without limitation, any foreclosure upon the collateral or transfer in lieu thereof). assignor recognizes that the organizational agreements of the corporations, the lock-up letter and the rights agreement may strictly limit transfers of the shareholder interests. assignor understands that compliance with the securities laws, the organizational agreements, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement might very strictly limit the course of conduct of agent if agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar applicable law analogous in purpose or effect. assignor recognizes that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations agent may, with respect to any sale of the collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, and those who are able to satisfy any conditions or requirements set forth in the organizational 17 agreements, the securities laws, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement. assignor and agent acknowledge and agreed that agent may be required to foreclose on and sell the collateral in parcels and at such time as agent may reasonably determine or an independent accounting or law firm opines that is necessary to comply with the conditions or requirements set forth in the organizational agreements of the corporations, the securities laws the lock-up letter and the rights agreement, including, without limitation, by way of a series of sales whereby the agent forecloses upon only a portion of the collateral and thereafter sells such portion of the collateral in such volume and at such times as agent may deem or an independent accounting or law firm opines that is necessary to comply with such conditions and restrictions, and following such sale agent may be required to repeat such process as many times as may be necessary to comply with such conditions and restrictions until all of the collateral is foreclosed on and sold. assignor acknowledges and agrees that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations, the agent in its sole and absolute discretion may, in accordance with applicable law, the organizational agreements, the lock-up letter and the rights agreement, (a) proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the securities laws (b) approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale and (c) sell the collateral in parcels and at such times and to such persons as agent may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with such conditions and requirements. assignor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof at a price that agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached or if all the collateral were sold at a single sale. assignor further agrees that any sale or sales by agent of the collateral made as provided in this paragraph 16 shall be commercially reasonable. assignor further agrees to provide to agent any and all materials reasonably necessary under applicable law for the agent to effectuate such sale. the provisions of this paragraph will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the agent sells. agent and the lenders shall not be liable to assignor for any loss in value of the collateral by reason of any delay in the sale of the collateral. 17. governing law; terms . this assignment shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california (other than perfection of a security interest in the certificate by control thereof, which shall be governed by the laws of the state where the certificate is located). 18. notices . each notice, demand, election or request provided for or permitted to be given pursuant to this assignment (hereinafter in referred to as a &#147;notice&#148;) must be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given or served if given in the manner prescribed in the loan agreement if given to assignor. 18 19. counterparts . this assignment may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may execute this assignment by signing any such counterpart. 20. no unwritten agreements . the written loan documents represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. there are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties. 21. miscellaneous . time is of the essence of this assignment. title or captions of paragraphs hereof are for convenience only and neither limit nor amplify the provisions hereof. if, for any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this assignment shall involve transcending the limit of validity presently prescribed by applicable law, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity; and if any clause or provision herein operates or would prospectively operate to invalidate this assignment, in whole or in part, then such clause or provision only shall be held for naught, as though not herein contained, and the remainder of this assignment shall remain operative and in full force and effect. 22. lock-up letter . agent agrees to

(a) upon the occurrence of any event of default, agent may take any action deemed by agent to be necessary or appropriate to the enforcement of the rights and remedies of agent under this assignment and the loan documents, including, without limitation, the exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to any or all of the collateral. the remedies of agent shall include, without limitation, all rights and remedies specified in the loan documents and this assignment, all remedies of agent under applicable general or statutory law, and the remedies of a secured party under the ucc, regardless of whether the ucc has been enacted or enacted in that form in any other jurisdiction in which such right or remedy is asserted. in addition to such other remedies as may exist from time to time, whether by way of set-off, banker&#146;s lien, consensual security interest or otherwise, upon the occurrence of an event of default, agent is authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to or demand upon assignor (any such notice or demand being expressly waived by assignor) to charge any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by agent to or for the credit of or the account of assignor against any and all of the obligations, irrespective of whether or not agent shall have made any demand for payment and although such obligations may be unmatured. any notice required by law, including, but not limited to, notice of the intended disposition of all or any portion of the collateral, shall be reasonable and properly given if given in the manner prescribed for the giving of notice herein, and, in the case of any notice of disposition, if given at least ten (10) days prior to such disposition. agent may require assignor to assemble the collateral and make it available to agent at any place to be designated by agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties. it is expressly understood and agreed that agent shall be entitled to dispose of the collateral at any public or private sale or sales, without recourse to judicial proceedings and without either demand, appraisement, advertisement or notice (except as such notice as is otherwise required under this assignment) of any kind, all of which are expressly waived, and that agent shall be entitled to bid and purchase at any such sale. in the event that agent is the successful bidder at any public or private sale of any note or other document or instrument evidencing assignor&#146;s right to receive a distribution, agent shall be entitled to credit the amount bid by agent against the obligations evidenced by such note, document or instrument rather than the obligations evidenced by the note. to the extent the collateral consists of marketable securities, agent shall not be obligated to sell such securities for the highest price obtainable, but shall sell them at the market price available on the date of sale. agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of the collateral if it shall determine not to do so regardless of the fact that notice of sale of the collateral may have been given. agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so 12 adjourned. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the collateral sold absolutely free from claim or right on the part of assignor. in the event that any consent, approval or authorization of any governmental agency or commission will be necessary to effectuate any such sale or sales, assignor shall execute all such applications or other instruments as agent may deem reasonably necessary to obtain such consent, approval or authorization. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, agent may notify any account debtor or obligor with respect to the collateral to make payment directly to agent, and may demand, collect, receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon the collateral as agent may determine whether or not the obligations or the collateral are due, and for the purpose of realizing agent&#146;s rights therein, agent may receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to assignor and endorse notes, checks, drafts, money orders, documents of title or other evidences of payment, shipment or storage of any form of collateral on behalf and in the name of assignor, as its attorney-in-fact. in addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints agent its true and lawful attorney-in-fact either in the name of agent or assignor to (i) sign assignor&#146;s name on any collateral, drafts against account debtors, assignments, any proof of claim in any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding involving any account debtor, any notice of lien, claim of lien or assignment or satisfaction of lien, or on any financing statement or continuation statement under the ucc; (ii) send verifications of accounts receivable to any account debtor; and (iii) in connection with a transfer of the collateral as described above, sign in assignor&#146;s name any documents necessary to transfer title to the collateral to agent or any third party. all acts of said attorney-in-fact are hereby ratified and approved and agent shall not be liable for any mistake of law or fact made in connection therewith. this power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any amounts remain unpaid on any of the obligations. all remedies of agent shall be cumulative to the full extent provided by law, all without liability except to account for property actually received, but the agent shall have no duty to exercise such rights and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. pursuit by agent of certain judicial or other remedies shall not abate nor bar other remedies with respect to the obligations or to other portions of the collateral. agent may exercise its rights to the collateral without resorting or regard to other collateral or sources of security or reimbursement for the obligations. in the event that any transfer tax, deed tax, conveyance tax or similar tax is payable in connection with the foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise of the shareholder interests or other collateral, assignor shall pay such amount to agent upon demand and if assignor fails to pay such amount on demand, agent may advance such amount on behalf of assignor and the amount thereof shall become a part of the obligations and bear interest at the rate for overdue amounts as set forth in the loan agreement until paid. (b) if assignor fails to perform any agreement or covenant contained in this assignment beyond any applicable period for notice and cure, agent may itself perform, or cause to be performed, any agreement or covenant of assignor contained in this assignment which assignor shall fail to perform, and the cost of such performance, together with any expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees actually incurred (including attorneys&#146; fees incurred in any appeal) by agent in connection therewith, shall be payable by assignor upon demand and shall constitute a part of the obligations and shall bear interest at the rate for overdue amounts as set forth in the loan agreement. 13 (c) whether or not an event of default has occurred and whether or not agent is the absolute owner of the collateral, agent may take such action as agent may deem necessary to protect the collateral or its security interest therein, agent being hereby authorized to pay, purchase, contest and compromise any encumbrance, charge or lien which in the reasonable judgment of agent appears to be prior or superior to its security interest, and in exercising any such powers and authority to pay necessary expenses, employ counsel and pay reasonable attorney&#146;s fees. any such advances made or expenses incurred by agent shall be deemed advanced under the loan documents, shall increase the indebtedness evidenced and secured thereby, shall be payable upon demand and shall bear interest at the rate for overdue payments set forth in the loan agreement. (d) any stock or securities and stock powers held by agent as collateral (including stock certificates) hereunder may, at any time, and at the option of agent, be registered in the name of agent or its nominee, endorsed or assigned in blank or in the name of any nominee and agent may deliver any or all of the collateral to the issuer or issuers thereof for the purpose of making denominational exchanges or registrations or transfer or for such other purposes in furtherance of this assignment as agent may deem desirable. until the occurrence of an event of default, assignor shall retain the right to vote any of the collateral, as applicable, or exercise shareholder rights, as applicable, in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of this assignment and the other loan documents, and agent hereby grants to assignor its proxy to enable assignor to so vote any of the collateral or exercise such shareholder rights, as applicable, (except that assignor shall not have any right to exercise any such power if the exercise thereof would violate or result in a violation of any of the terms of this assignment or any of the other loan documents). at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, agent or its nominee shall, without notice or demand, automatically have the sole and exclusive right to give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the collateral and exercise all voting and other shareholder, management, approval or other rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the corporations, (and the right to call such meetings) or otherwise (and to give written consents in lieu of voting thereon), and exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any of the rights, privileges or options pertaining to the collateral and otherwise act with respect thereto and thereunder as if agent or its nominee were the absolute owner thereof (all of such rights of assignor ceasing to exist and terminating upon the occurrence of an event of default) including, without limitation, the right to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of the collateral upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or the readjustment of the issuer thereof, all without liability except to account for property actually received and in such manner as agent shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion, but agent shall have no duty to exercise any of the aforesaid rights, privileges or options and shall not be responsible for the failure to do so or delay in so doing. the exercise by agent of any of its rights and remedies under this paragraph shall not be deemed a disposition of collateral under article 9 of the ucc nor an acceptance by agent of any of the collateral in satisfaction of the obligations. (e) notwithstanding anything in this assignment or any other loan document to the contrary, any reference in this assignment or any other loan document to &#147;the continuance of a default&#148; or &#147;the continuance of an event of default&#148; or any similar phrase shall not create or be deemed to create any right of assignor or any other party to cure any default following the expiration of any applicable grace or notice and cure period. 14 10. duties of agent . the powers conferred on agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. agent&#146;s duty with reference to the collateral shall be solely to use slight care in the custody and preservation of the collateral, which shall not include any steps necessary to preserve rights against prior parties and to use such care in the custody of collateral in the possession of agent as is accorded to other personal property of the same type as the collateral in the possession of the agent. agent shall have no responsibility or liability for the collection of any collateral or by reason of any invalidity, lack of value or uncollectability of any of the payments received by it. 11. indemnification . (a) it is specifically understood and agreed that this assignment shall not operate to place any responsibility or obligation whatsoever upon the agent or any of the lenders, or cause the agent or any of the lenders to be, or to be deemed to be, a shareholder in any of the corporations and that in accepting this assignment, the agent and the lenders neither assume nor agree to perform at any time whatsoever any obligation or duty of assignor relating to the collateral or under any of the organizational agreements or any other mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement or instrument to which the corporations are a party or to which they are subject, all of which obligations and duties shall be and remain with and upon the assignor. (b) assignor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the agent and the lenders harmless from and against any and all claims, expenses, losses and liabilities growing out of or resulting from this assignment or acts taken or omitted to be taken by the agent or the lenders hereunder or in connection therewith (including, without limitation, enforcement of this assignment), except claims, expenses, losses or liabilities resulting from agent&#146;s or such lender&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. (c) assignor upon demand shall pay to agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel actually incurred (including those incurred in any appeal), and of any experts and agents, which agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this assignment, (ii) the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of agent hereunder, or (iv) the failure by assignor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. 12. security interest absolute . all rights of agent, and the security interests hereunder, and all of the obligations secured hereby, shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the loan documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time (including the extension of the maturity date of the note), manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the loan documents; 15 (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any other collateral for the obligations, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any of the loan documents with respect to all or any part of the obligations; or (d) any other circumstance (other than payment of the obligations in full) that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, assignor or any third party for the obligations or any part thereof. 13. amendments and waivers . no amendment or waiver of any provision of this assignment nor consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. no delay or omission of agent to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon any event of default shall exhaust or impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such event of default, or acquiescence therein; and every right, power and remedy given by this assignment to agent may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by agent. failure on the part of agent to complain of any act or failure to act which constitutes an event of default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by agent of agent&#146;s rights hereunder or impair any rights, powers or remedies consequent on any event of default. assignor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law all rights which assignor has or may have under and by virtue of the ucc and any federal, state, county or municipal statute, regulation, ordinance, constitution or charter, now or hereafter existing, similar in effect thereto providing any right of assignor to notice and to a judicial hearing prior to seizure by agent of any of the collateral. assignor hereby waives and renounces for itself, its heirs, successors and assigns, presentment, demand, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except for any notice required by law or the loan documents) and all rights to the benefits of any statute of limitations and any moratorium, reinstatement, marshaling, forbearance, valuation, stay, extension, homestead, redemption and appraisement now provided or which may hereafter be provided by the constitution and laws of the united states and of any state thereof, both as to itself and in and to all of its property, real and personal, against the enforcement of this assignment and the collection of any of the obligations. 14. continuing security interest; transfer of note; release of collateral . this assignment shall create a continuing security interest in the collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations and the lenders have no further obligation to make any advances under the note, (b) be binding upon assignor and its permitted heirs, successors and assigns, and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of agent hereunder, to the benefit of the agent and the lenders and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. upon the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations and the termination or expiration of any obligation of the lenders to make further advances under the note, the security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the collateral shall revert to the assignor that granted such security interest. upon any such termination, agent will, at assignor&#146;s expense, execute and deliver to assignor such documents as assignor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. 16 15. modifications, etc . assignor hereby consents and agrees that agent may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent from assignor, either with or without consideration, surrender any property or other security of any kind or nature whatsoever held by it or by any person, firm or corporation on its behalf or for its account, securing the obligations; substitute for any collateral so held by it, other collateral of like kind; agree to modification of the terms of the loan documents; extend or renew the loan documents for any period; grant releases, compromises and indulgences with respect to the loan documents for any period or to any persons or entities now or hereafter liable thereunder or hereunder; release any guarantor, endorser or any other person or entity liable with respect to the obligations; or take or fail to take any action of any type whatsoever; and no such action which agent shall take or fail to take in connection with the loan documents, or any of them, or any security for the payment of the obligations or for the performance of any obligations or undertakings of assignor, nor any course of dealing with assignor or any other person, shall release assignor&#146;s obligations hereunder, affect this assignment in any way or afford assignor any recourse against agent. 16. securities act and other limitations . in view of the position of assignor in relation to the collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the securities laws or the organizational agreements of the corporations, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement with respect to any disposition of the collateral permitted hereunder (including, without limitation, any foreclosure upon the collateral or transfer in lieu thereof). assignor recognizes that the organizational agreements of the corporations, the lock-up letter and the rights agreement may strictly limit transfers of the shareholder interests. assignor understands that compliance with the securities laws, the organizational agreements, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement might very strictly limit the course of conduct of agent if agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or similar applicable law analogous in purpose or effect. assignor recognizes that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations agent may, with respect to any sale of the collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, and those who are able to satisfy any conditions or requirements set forth in the organizational agreements, the securities laws, the lock-up letter or the rights agreement. assignor and agent acknowledge and agreed that agent may be required to foreclose on and sell the collateral in parcels and at such time as agent may reasonably determine or an independent accounting or law firm opines that is necessary to comply with the conditions or requirements set forth in the organizational agreements of the corporations, the securities laws the lock-up letter and the rights agreement, including, without limitation, by way of a series of sales whereby the agent forecloses upon only a portion of the collateral and thereafter sells such portion of the collateral in such volume and at such times as agent may deem or an independent accounting or law firm opines that is necessary to comply with such conditions and restrictions, and following such sale agent may be required to repeat such process as many times as may be necessary to comply with such conditions and restrictions until all of the collateral is foreclosed on and sold. assignor acknowledges and agrees that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations, the agent in its sole and absolute discretion may, in accordance with applicable law, the organizational 17 agreements, the lock-up letter and the rights agreement, (a) proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the securities laws (b) approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale and (c) sell the collateral in parcels and at such times and to such persons as agent may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with such conditions and requirements. assignor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the collateral in accordance with the terms hereof at a price that agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached or if all the collateral were sold at a single sale. assignor further agrees that any sale or sales by agent of the collateral made as provided in this paragraph 16 shall be commercially reasonable. assignor further agrees to provide to agent any and all materials reasonably necessary under applicable law for the agent to effectuate such sale. the provisions of this paragraph will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the agent sells. agent and the lenders shall not be liable to assignor for any loss in value of the collateral by reason of any delay in the sale of the collateral. 17. governing law; terms . this assignment shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california (other than perfection of a security interest in the certificate by control thereof, which shall be governed by the laws of the state where the certificate is located). 18. notices . each notice, demand, election or request provided for or permitted to be given pursuant to this assignment (hereinafter in referred to as a &#147;notice&#148;) must be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given or served if given in the manner prescribed in the loan agreement if given to assignor. 19. counterparts . this assignment may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may execute this assignment by signing any such counterpart. 20. no unwritten agreements . the written loan documents represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. there are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties. 21. miscellaneous . time is of the essence of this assignment. title or captions of paragraphs hereof are for convenience only and neither limit nor amplify the provisions hereof. if, for any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this assignment shall involve transcending the limit of validity presently prescribed by applicable law, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity; and if any clause or provision herein 18 operates or would prospectively operate to invalidate this assignment, in whole or in part, then such clause or provision only shall be held for naught, as though not herein contained, and the remainder of this assignment shall remain operative and in full force and effect. 22. lock-up letter . agent agrees to be bound by the restrictions in the lock-up letter.

loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations; extend or renew the obligations for any period; grant releases, compromises and indulgences with respect to the obligations or the loan documents and to any persons or entities now or hereafter liable thereunder or hereunder; release any other guarantor, surety, endorser or accommodation party of the note, the security documents, any other loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations; or take or fail to take any action of any type whatsoever. no such action which lender shall take or fail to take in connection 2 with the obligations or the loan documents, or any of them, or any security for the payment of the indebtedness of borrowers to lender or for the performance of any obligations or undertakings of borrowers or guarantor, nor any course of dealing with borrowers or any other person, shall release guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder, affect this guaranty in any way or afford guarantor any recourse against lender. the provisions of this guaranty shall extend and be applicable to all replacements, supplements, renewals, amendments, extensions, consolidations, restatements and modifications of the note, the loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations, and any and all references herein to the note, the loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations shall be deemed to include any such replacements, supplements, renewals, extensions, amendments, consolidations, restatements or modifications thereof. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, guarantor acknowledges the terms of section 18.3 of the loan agreement and agrees that this guaranty shall extend and be applicable to each new or replacement note delivered by borrowers pursuant thereto without notice to or further consent from guarantor. 4. no contest with lender; subordination . so long as any of the obligations hereby guaranteed remain unpaid or undischarged, guarantor will not, by paying any sum recoverable hereunder (whether or not demanded by lender) or by any means or on any other ground, claim any set-off or counterclaim against borrowers in respect of any liability of guarantor to borrowers or, in proceedings under federal bankruptcy law or insolvency proceedings of any nature, prove in competition with lender in respect of any payment hereunder or be entitled to have the benefit of any counterclaim or proof of claim or dividend or payment by or on behalf of borrowers or the benefit of any other security for any of the obligations hereby guaranteed which, now or hereafter, lender may hold or in which it may have any share. guarantor hereby expressly waives any right of contribution from or indemnity against borrowers, whether at law or in equity, arising from any payments made by guarantor pursuant to the terms of this guaranty, and guarantor acknowledges that guarantor has no right whatsoever to proceed against borrowers for reimbursement of any such payments. in connection with the foregoing, guarantor expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation to lender against borrowers, and guarantor hereby waives any rights to enforce any remedy which lender may have against borrowers and any rights to participate in any collateral for borrowers&#146; obligations under the loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations. guarantor hereby subordinates any and all indebtedness of borrowers now or hereafter owed to guarantor to all indebtedness of borrowers to lender, and agrees with lender that (a) guarantor shall not demand or accept any payment from borrowers on account of such indebtedness, (b) guarantor shall not claim any offset or other reduction of guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder because of any such indebtedness, and (c) guarantor shall not take any action to obtain any interest in any of the security described in and encumbered by the loan documents or the agreements relating to the hedge obligations because of any such indebtedness; provided, however, that, if lender so requests, such indebtedness shall be collected, enforced and received by guarantor as trustee for lender and be paid over to lender on account of the indebtedness of borrowers to lender, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of guarantor under the other provisions of this guaranty except to the extent the principal amount or other portion of such outstanding indebtedness shall have been reduced by such payment. 5. waiver of defenses . guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by, and hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any right or defense based on: 3 (a) (i) any change in the amount, interest rate or due date or other term of any of the obligations hereby guaranteed, (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of all or any portion of the obligations hereby guaranteed, (iii) any amendment or waiver of, or consent to the departure from or other indulgence with respect to, the loan agreement, any other loan document, or any other document or instrument evidencing or relating to any obligations hereby guaranteed, or (iv) any waiver, renewal, extension, addition, or supplement to, or deletion from, or any other action or inaction under or in respect of, the loan agreement, any of the other loan documents, or any other documents, instruments or agreements relating to the obligations hereby guaranteed or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein or evidencing any obligations hereby guaranteed or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing; (b) any subordination of the payment of the obligations hereby guaranteed to the payment of any other liability of the borrowers or any other person; (c) any act or failure to act by borrowers or any other person which may adversely affect guarantor&#146;s subrogation rights, if any, against borrowers or any other person to recover payments made under this guaranty; (d) any nonperfection or impairment of any security interest or other lien on any collateral, if any, securing in any way any of the obligations hereby guaranteed; (e) any application of sums paid by the borrowers or any other person with respect to the liabilities of lender, regardless of what liabilities of the borrowers remain unpaid; (f) any defense of borrowers, including without limitation, the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the obligations; (g) either with or without notice to guarantor, any renewal, extension, modification, amendment or another changes in the obligations, including but not limited to any material alteration of the terms of payment or performance of the obligations; or (h) any statute of limitations in any action hereunder or for the collection of the note or for the payment or performance of any obligation hereby guaranteed; (i) the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of borrowers or any other person or entity, or the failure of lender to file or enforce a claim against the estate (either in administration, bankruptcy or in any other proceeding) of borrowers or any other person; (j) the dissolution or termination of existence of borrowers or any other person; (k) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of borrowers or any other person; (l) the voluntary or involuntary receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, assignment, composition, or readjustment of, or any similar proceeding affecting, borrowers or any other person, or any of borrowers&#146; or any other person&#146;s properties or assets; (m) the damage, destruction, foreclosure or surrender of all or any part of the collateral; 4 (n) the failure of lender to give notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation of borrowers or of any action or nonaction on the part of any other person whomsoever in connection with any obligation hereby guaranteed; (o) any failure or delay of lender to commence an action against borrowers or any other person, to assert or enforce any remedies against borrowers under the note or the other loan documents or agreements relating to the hedge obligations, or to realize upon any security; (p) any failure of any duty on the part of lender to disclose to guarantor any facts it may now or hereafter know regarding borrowers (including, without limitation borrowers&#146; financial condition), any other person, the collateral, or any other assets or liabilities of such persons, whether such facts materially increase the risk to guarantor or not (it being agreed that guarantor assumes responsibility for being informed with respect to such information); (q) failure to accept or give notice of acceptance of this guaranty by lender; (r) failure to make or give notice of presentment and demand for payment of any of the indebtedness or performance of any of the obligations hereby guaranteed; (s) failure to make or give protest and notice of dishonor or of default to guarantor or to any other party with respect to the indebtedness or performance of obligations hereby guaranteed; (t) any and all other notices whatsoever to which guarantor might otherwise be entitled; (u) any lack of diligence by lender in collection, protection or realization upon any collateral securing the payment of the indebtedness or performance of obligations hereby guaranteed; (v) the invalidity or unenforceability of the note, or any of the other loan documents, or any of the agreements relating to the hedge obligations, or any assignment or transfer of the foregoing; (w) the compromise, settlement, release or termination of any or all of the obligations of borrowers under the note or the other loan documents or any of the agreements relating to the hedge obligations; (x) any transfer by borrowers or any other person of all or any part of the security encumbered by the loan documents; (y) the failure of lender to perfect any security or to extend or renew the perfection of any security; (z) any and all of the rights and defenses described in section 2856(a) of the california civil code; 5 (aa) any and all of the rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution and other rights and defenses that are or may become available to guarantor by reason of sections 2787 to 2855 (inclusive), 2899 and 3433 of the california civil code; (bb) except to the extent prohibited by section 9602 of the california commercial code, any and all rights and defenses that guarantor might otherwise have under the california commercial code; or (cc) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any other legal, equitable or surety defenses whatsoever to which guarantor might otherwise be entitled, it being the intention that the obligations of guarantor hereunder are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable. guarantor understands that the exercise by lender of certain rights and remedies may affect or eliminate guarantor&#146;s right of subrogation against the borrowers and that guarantor may therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability hereunder. nevertheless, guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers lender, its successors, endorsees and assigns, to exercise in its or their sole discretion, any rights and remedies, or any combination thereof, which may then be available, it being the purpose and intent of guarantor that the obligations hereunder shall be absolute, continuing, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances. notwithstanding any other provision of this guaranty to the contrary, guarantor hereby waives and releases any claim or other rights which guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against the borrowers or any other person of all or any of the obligations of guarantor hereunder that arise from the existence or performance of guarantor&#146;s obligations under this guaranty or any of the other loan documents, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of lender against the borrowers or any other person or any collateral which lender now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the borrowers, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. without limitation on the generality of the other waivers contained in this guaranty, guarantor hereby waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the lender, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed or otherwise impaired guarantor&#146;s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal (whether by the operation of any provision of the california code of civil procedure or otherwise). in addition, guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced, dependent upon or affected by, and hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any defense based on, any one or more of the following: (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of, or the existence of any default with respect to, the obligations, any security therefor, or any related instrument, documents, obligation, transaction or matter; (ii) the nature, extent, condition, value or continued existence of any security given in connection with the obligations; (iii) any action or failure to take action by any holder of the obligations under or with respect to this guaranty or the obligations, any security therefor, or any related documents, transaction or matter; (iv) any other dealings between any holder of the obligations and lender; (v) any exculpatory language or provisions limiting or 6 restricting lender&#146;s rights or remedies against the borrowers or any other person under the loan documents; or (vi) any claim by or on behalf of borrowers of any credit or right of setoff with respect to the note or any of the obligations. 6. guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection . this is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection. the liability of guarantor under this guaranty shall be primary, direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against borrowers or any other person, nor against securities or liens available to lender, its successors, successors in title, endorsees or assigns. guarantor hereby waives any right to require that an action be brought against borrowers or any other person or to require that resort be had to any security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of lender in favor of borrowers or any other person. 7. rights and remedies of lender . in the event of an event of default under the note or the loan documents, or any of them, that is continuing (it being understood that the lender has no obligation to accept cure after an event of default occurs), lender shall have the right to enforce its rights, powers and remedies thereunder or hereunder or under any other loan document, in any order, and all rights, powers and remedies available to lender in such event shall be nonexclusive and cumulative of all other rights, powers and remedies provided thereunder or hereunder or by law or in equity. accordingly, guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers lender upon the occurrence of any event of default under the note or the loan documents, at its sole discretion, and without notice to guarantor, to exercise any right or remedy which lender may have, including, but not limited to, judicial foreclosure, exercise of rights of power of sale, acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, appointment of a receiver to collect rents and profits, exercise of remedies against personal property, or enforcement of any assignment of leases, as to any security, whether real, personal or intangible. at any public or private sale of any security or collateral for any of the obligations guaranteed hereby, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, lender may, in its discretion, purchase all or any part of such security or collateral so sold or offered for sale for its own account and may apply against the amount bid therefor all or any part of the balance due it pursuant to the terms of the note or security documents or any other loan document or agreements relating to the hedge obligations without prejudice to lender&#146;s remedies hereunder against guarantor for deficiencies. if the obligations guaranteed hereby are partially paid by reason of the election of lender to pursue any of the remedies available to lender, or if such obligations are otherwise partially paid, this guaranty shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and guarantor shall remain liable for the entire balance of the obligations guaranteed hereby even though any rights which guarantor may have against borrowers or any other person may be destroyed or diminished by the exercise of any such remedy. 8. application of payments . guarantor hereby authorizes lender, without notice to guarantor, to apply all payments and credits received from borrowers or from guarantor or realized from any security in such manner and in such priority as lender in its sole judgment shall see fit to the obligations. 9. business failure, bankruptcy or insolvency . in the event of the business failure of guarantor or if there shall be pending any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding with respect to guarantor under federal bankruptcy law or any other applicable law or in connection with the insolvency of guarantor, or if a liquidator, receiver, or trustee shall have been appointed for guarantor or guarantor&#146;s properties or assets, lender may file such proofs of claim and other 7 papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of lender allowed in any proceedings relative to guarantor, or any of guarantor&#146;s properties or assets, and, irrespective of whether the indebtedness or other obligations of borrowers guaranteed hereby shall then be due and payable, by declaration or otherwise, lender shall be entitled and empowered to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any sums or sums owing with respect to the indebtedness or other obligations of borrowers guaranteed hereby, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim. guarantor covenants and agrees that upon the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding by or against borrowers, guarantor shall not seek a supplemental stay or otherwise pursuant to 11 u.s.c. &#167;105 or any other provision of the bankruptcy code, as amended, or any other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law, or otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, which may be or become applicable, to stay, interdict, condition, reduce or inhibit the ability of lender to enforce any rights of lender against guarantor by virtue of this guaranty or otherwise. 10. covenants of guarantor . (a) guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with lender that until all indebtedness guaranteed hereby has been completely repaid and all obligations and undertakings of borrowers under, by reason of, or pursuant to the note and the other loan documents and the agreements relating to the hedge obligations have been completely performed and lender has no further obligation to make loans, guarantor will comply with any and all covenants applicable to guarantor set forth in the loan agreement. (b) guarantor will deliver or cause to be delivered to the lender: (i) as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than october 31 of each calendar year, the unaudited balance sheet of guarantor at the end of such year, setting forth the assets, liabilities and net worth of guarantor and accompanied by supplementary schedules indicating the total debt on any assets shown on a net investment basis, all to be in reasonable detail, prepared in accordance with sound accounting principles, and certified without qualification by the chief operating officer of mmpi or by an independent certified public accountant reasonably satisfactory to lender as fairly presenting guarantor&#146;s financial condition as of the end of such year; (ii) contemporaneously with the delivery of the financial statements referred to in clause (i) above, a statement of all contingent liabilities of guarantor which are not reflected in such financial statements or referred to in the notes thereto (including, without limitation, all guarantees, endorsements and other contingent obligations in respect of indebtedness of others, and obligations to reimburse the issuer in respect of any letters of credit), all in reasonable detail and certified by guarantor; (iii) upon the request of lender, copies of all annual federal income tax returns and amendments thereto of guarantor; and (iv) from time to time such other financial data and information in the possession of the guarantor regarding the guarantor as the lender may reasonably request. 8 11. security and rights of set-off . guarantor hereby grants to lender, as security for the full and prompt payment and performance of guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder, a continuing lien on and security interest in any and all securities or other property belonging to guarantor now or hereafter held by lender and in any and all deposits (general or specific, time or demand, provisional or final, regardless of currency, maturity, or the branch of lender where the deposits are held) now or hereafter held by lender and other sums credited by or due from lender to guarantor or subject to withdrawal by guarantor; and regardless of the adequacy of any collateral or other means of obtaining repayment of such obligations, during the continuance of any event of default under the note or the loan documents, lender may at any time and without notice to guarantor set-off and apply the whole or any portion or portions of any or all such deposits and other sums against amounts payable under this guaranty, whether or not any other person or persons could also withdraw money therefrom. any security now or hereafter held by or for guarantor and provided by borrowers, or by anyone on borrowers&#146; behalf, in respect of liabilities of guarantor hereunder shall be held in trust for lender as security for the liabilities of guarantor hereunder. 12. changes in writing; no revocation . this guaranty may not be changed orally, and no obligation of guarantor can be released or waived by lender except as provided in &#167;27 of the loan agreement. this guaranty shall be irrevocable by guarantor until all indebtedness guaranteed hereby has been completely repaid and all obligations and undertakings of borrowers under, by reason of, or pursuant to the note and the loan documents and the agreements relating to the hedge obligations have been completely performed and the lenders have no further obligation to advance loans. 13. notices . all notices, demands or requests provided for or permitted
