and issuer. this statement relates to the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ("shares"), of efi electronics corporation ("efi"). efi's address is 2415 south 2300 west, salt lake city, utah 84119. item 2. identity and background. the name and business address of the person filing this statement is hubbell incorporated ("hubbell"), p.o. box 549, 584 derby-milford road, orange, connecticut 06477-4025. hubbell is a connecticut corporation and is primarily engaged in the engineering, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products. information concerning the executive officers and directors of hubbell is set forth on appendix 1 to this schedule 13d. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the aggregate purchase price paid by hubbell in the transaction described in item 4 below was $1,777,856. hubbell obtained these funds from its general corporate funds. item 4. purpose of transaction. pursuant to an agreement dated as of august 26, 1997 (the "agreement") among efi, hubbell and the stockholders of efi listed on exhibit a to the agreement (the "stockholders"), hubbell purchased from efi 1,054,044 shares at a price of $1.6867 per share for an aggregate price of $1,777,856. efi also issued to hubbell a warrant expiring on august 25, 2002 to purchase up to 527,022 shares at an exercise price of $1.6867 per share (the "warrant"). the warrant is only exercisable for such number of shares as may be necessary to maintain hubbell's ownership of 20% of the outstanding shares in the event of other issuances of shares by the company. pursuant to the agreement, efi caused mr. james h. biggart, jr., vice president and treasurer of hubbell to be elected to the efi board of directors (the "board"). efi has agreed to continue to nominate a designee of hubbell to the board for as long as hubbell owns in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares and, during such period, efi will not permit its board to consist of more than five members. in the event that hubbell beneficially owns less than 5% of the outstanding shares, efi may request hubbell's designee to resign from the board unless the failure to maintain 5% ownership is not caused by a disposition of shares by hubbell 4 page 4 of 40 pages in which event hubbell shall have 30 days to acquire shares to increase its ownership to 5%. efi has also agreed that for so long as hubbell beneficially owns at least 10% of the shares, if efi issues any additional stock of efi, or securities of efi convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such stock or representing rights to acquire such stock effected in a private placement or privately negotiated transaction for the purpose of raising capital (exclusive of stock issued pursuant to director or employee benefit plans or in connection with acquisitions or other reorganizations) and, as a result thereof any person would own in excess of 10% of the stock of efi, then the company shall offer to issue to hubbell, on 30 days notice and the same terms and conditions, such number of securities of the company as well permit hubbell to maintain the percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the company owned by hubbell immediately prior to an issuance by the company (the "applicable investor position"), or, if the percentage interest of such person would be higher than the applicable investor position, the percentage interest which would be attained by such person. for so long as hubbell beneficially owns at least 10% of the shares, hubbell shall have a right of first refusal on any or all shares proposed to be sold or transferred by the stockholders or their estates. the right of first refusal does not apply to (a) a transfer of shares without consideration for estate planning purposes, provided that any such transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the right of first refusal with respect to subsequent transfers or (b) sales in open market transactions not in excess of 100,000 shares in any 90 day period. during the period ending on august 26, 2000 without the company's prior written consent, hubbell agrees not to: (i) directly or indirectly acquire through open market purchases shares which, when added to the shares held by hubbell, would exceed 22 percent (22%) of the outstanding shares; (ii) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any "solicitation" (as such term is used in the proxy rules of the securities and exchange commission as in effect on the date hereof) of proxies or consents; (iii) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934) with respect to the shares, other than groups consisting solely of hubbell and its affiliates; or (iv) deposit any shares in any voting trust or subject the shares to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of any shares except as set forth hereunder. the restrictions contained in this paragraph shall terminate in the event that any person acquires in open market purchases more than 10% of the outstanding stock of the company or commences a tender or 5 page 5 of 40 pages exchange offer to acquire more than 10% of the stock of the company. the agreement also provides that hubbell may require efi to register shares held by hubbell under the securities act of 1933. simultaneously with entering into the agreement, hubbell entered into a supply contract with efi. subject to the restrictions described above, hubbell may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other investment considerations, purchase additional shares of efi or dispose of its holdings in efi. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. hubbell is the beneficial owner of 1,054,044 shares held by it and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 527,022 shares which may become issuable upon exercise of the warrant. hubbell disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares subject to the warrant until such time as the warrant becomes exercisable. none of the persons named in appendix 1 beneficially owns any shares and, other than as described in item 4 -- purpose of transaction above, neither hubbell nor any of such persons has effected any transactions in shares during the 60 days preceding the filing of this schedule 13d. item 6. contracts, arrangements, undertakings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the principal terms of the agreement and the warrant are described above under item 4 - purpose of transaction. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. 1. agreement dated as of august 26, 1997 (the "agreement"), among efi electronics corporation, a delaware corporation ("efi"), hubbell incorporated, a
