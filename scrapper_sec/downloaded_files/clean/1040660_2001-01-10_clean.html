business (see item 4 below). the foregoing description of the share purchase agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, which is attached hereto as exhibit b and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. item 4. purpose of transaction. ---------------------- the share purchase agreement provided for the sale of the large area coating business of parent (the "lad business"). parent reorganized its lad business by transferring all of the assets and certain liabilities (including employments) of the lad business operated in germany, belgium and korea to new entities (the "new lad entities"). the portion of the lad business operated in germany was transferred to a newly established german kg ("newco kg"). unaxis gmbh is the sole limited partner of newco kg and newco gmbh, a wholly owned subsidiary of unaxis gmbh, is the general partner of newco kg. pursuant to the share purchase agreement, unaxis gmbh sold to afco the limited partnership interest in newco kg (the "kg interest") and the share in newco gmbh (the "gmbh interest" and together with the kg interest, the "shares") owned by unaxis gmbh. in addition, on the closing date, parent sold and transferred to the issuer or its designated subsidiary the shares in the new lad entities other than newco kg and newco gmbh (the "foreign shares") as well as the assets and liabilities of the lad business operated in the u.s., hongkong and japan on the basis of separate agreements and/or transfer documents. the parties agreed to transfer to the issuer or its designated subsidiaries the lad business operated in china and taiwan as promptly as permitted by law after the closing date. the aggregate consideration owed by afco for the acquisition of the shares and by the issuer or its designated subsidiary for the foreign shares and the foreign assets and liabilities equalled (a) us$ 60,000,000, subject to adjustment (the "cash component") and (b) 673,353 shares of issuer common stock (the "stock component"). as provided by the share purchase agreement, the stock component was delivered by afco to unaxis gmbh on the closing date. in the share purchase agreement, the issuer has agreed to ensure that immediately after the closing date a person nominated by unaxis gmbh is appointed to the board of directors of the issuer (the "board"). for the period during which unaxis gmbh continues to own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock or purchases additional shares as set forth below, a person nominated by unaxis gmbh to the board will be proposed to the stockholders' meeting of the issuer for election. if unaxis gmbh sells any of its shares of issuer common stock and subsequently owns less than 10% of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock for any reason, including because of additional shares issued by the issuer, unaxis gmbh's right to a seat on the board will be 2 lost immediately. if unaxis gmbh has not sold any of its shares of issuer common stock and falls below 10% of the total outstanding shares of issuer common stock because the issuer issues additional shares or takes other corporate action: (a) unaxis gmbh will be permitted to purchase additional shares of issuer common stock either from the issuer or in the open market to keep its ownership at or above 10%; (b) if unaxis gmbh does not purchase enough shares of issuer common stock to restore its ownership to 10% or more of the total outstanding shares of issuer common stock, it will lose its right to a seat on the board immediately, subject to paragraph (c) below; (c) if unaxis gmbh has spent us$2 million to purchase shares of issuer common stock pursuant to paragraph (a) above, and still owns less than 10% of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock, unaxis gmbh will nonetheless retain its right to a seat on the board until one year after the closing date. at such time as unaxis gmbh loses its right to a seat on the board, unaxis gmbh will cause the director nominated by it to resign within ten days. thereafter, the issuer will have no further obligation to nominate unaxis gmbh's designee to the board, even if unaxis gmbh's ownership of issuer common stock later increases above 10% of the total outstanding shares of issuer common stock. in the share purchase agreement, unaxis gmbh agreed not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of issuer common stock which it has acquired as part of the stock component for a period of nine months following the closing date. in addition, unaxis gmbh agreed, except for the shares of issuer common stock acquired pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, that it will not and will cause its affiliates not to acquire additional shares of issuer common stock after the closing date for so long as a nominee of unaxis gmbh is a member of the board and a period of six months after the unaxis gmbh nominee has resigned as described above, however at least for a period of two years after the closing date, in open market transactions or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the issuer. upon the expiration of the restrictions set forth above, the reporting persons from time to time intend to review their investment in the issuer on the basis of various factors, including the issuer's
