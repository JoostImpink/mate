&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.4.3 the minister, the commission and the ntma will be under no obligation to do anything which would create a legal obligation for, give rise to a claim from any third party against or result in any liability for the minister, the commission or the ntma; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.4.4 the minister, the commission or the ntma shall not be required to take any action which would be against public policy or detrimental to the financial stability of boi or the stability of the financial system of the irish state as a whole. &#160; &#160; 6.5 the minister, the commission and the ntma accept no liability to the buyers in respect of the commission warranties or the indemnity.&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt nothing in this agreement or any of the other transaction documents shall affect in any way the rights and claims of the commission, the minister and the ntma under the commission warranties or the indemnity as they relate to ordinary stock other than the sale stock. &#160; &#160; 6.6 the commission acknowledges that each of the buyers are entering into this agreement in reliance upon each of the warranties contained in clause 6.1 and on the assignment and undertakings provided for in clause 6.2. &#160; &#160; 6.7&#160;&#160; each of: &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.7.1&#160;&#160; the state title warranties will be construed separately and will not be limited by reference (express or implied) to the terms of any other representation, warranty or undertaking or any other term of this agreement;

14 &#160; 6.8 the aggregate liability of the commission under the state title warranties in respect of all claims shall be subject to an overall maximum equal to the aggregate of the consideration for sale stock payable hereunder, less any deductions or set-offs made pursuant to this agreement. &#160; &#160; 6.9 nothing herein shall or shall be deemed to relieve any of the buyers of any common law duty to mitigate any loss or damage incurred by it. &#160; &#160; 7. public interest undertaking &#160; &#160; 7.1 each buyer undertakes and covenants that for a period commencing on first completion and ending on 1 march 2016, it shall neither initiate nor support a refusal by boi to agree a rollover of the nama bonds or a demand for payment thereof, or any attempt to induce boi to make such a refusal or demand, in respect of either the nama bonds now held by boi or nama bonds of similar or lesser aggregate nominal value issued annually in succession thereto. &#160; &#160; 7.2 each buyer acknowledges that the state entities are relying on the undertaking and covenant set out in clause 7.1 in entering into this agreement. &#160; &#160; 8. lock up &#160; &#160; 8.1 subject to clause 8.3, each of the buyers hereby severally undertakes to the minister and the commission on its own behalf and on behalf of all associated entities to which it may transfer sale stock pursuant to clause 8.2.6 that for a period commencing on the first completion date and ending on the 90th day thereafter or the whitewash date, whichever is the first to occur, neither such buyer nor its associated entities as aforesaid will sell, transfer, grant any option over or otherwise dispose of its legal, beneficial or any other interest held by it in any of the sale stock acquired by it upon such completion date.&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt, this clause shall not prohibit the sale, transfer, grant of option over or other disposal by any buyer or its associated entities of boi ordinary stock other than sale stock. &#160; &#160; 8.2&#160; the restrictions set out in clause 8.1 shall not apply to: &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.1 any disposal pursuant to acceptance of (or giving an irrevocable undertaking to accept) any offer or agreement by the buyer to vote in favour of or participate in a scheme of arrangement to acquire the whole or any part of the issued stock capital of boi (other than any stock already held by the offeror or persons acting in concert with the offeror) to which the provisions of the takeover act and rules apply; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.2&#160;&#160; any compromise or arrangement providing for the acquisition by any person (or group of persons acting in concert) of 50 per cent of more of the issued capital stock of boi; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.3 any disposal or agreement to dispose of boi ordinary stock pursuant to an offer by boi to purchase its own issued capital stock which is made on identical terms to all holders of boi ordinary stock and otherwise complies with applicable legal requirements and otherwise complies with the listing rules; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.4 any disposal made pursuant to a court order or otherwise required by law; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.5 any disposal made in accordance with clause 9 (assignment); or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.2.6 any disposal by a relevant person to an associated entity of that relevant person and/or any subsequent disposals by any such associated entity of that relevant person to another associated entity of that relevant person. &#160; &#160; 8.3 the restrictions in clause 8.1 shall expire on the whitewash date. &#160; 15 &#160; 9. assignment &#160; &#160; 9.1 the minister, the ntma and the commission may assign or transfer any of their respective rights or benefits under this agreement to any entity wholly-owned by the irish state, but they may not transfer their obligations hereunder without each of the buyers&#8217; prior written consent. &#160; &#160; 9.2 any relevant person may assign the benefit of this agreement to any person to whom any sale stock is transferred in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.2.6. &#160; &#160; 10. covenant &#160; &#160; &#160; the commission covenants with each buyer that the commission shall take up in full all of its rights under the rights issue. &#160; &#160; 11. further assurance and role of minister &#160; &#160; &#160; the commission shall, upon receipt of a direction from the minister, execute all documents and do all acts and things as may reasonably be required after completion by any buyer or its successor(s) for assuring to or vesting in such buyer (or its designees) the legal and beneficial ownership of the sale stock acquired by it hereunder and generally to give effect to this agreement.&#160;&#160;the minister agrees to give a direction to the commission as necessary to enable the commission to comply with this clause 11. &#160; &#160; 12. waiver &#160; &#160; &#160; a waiver by any party or parties of any breach of any of the terms, provisions or covenants of this agreement or the acquiescence of any party or parties in any act (whether of commission or omission) which, but for such acquiescence, would be a breach as aforesaid shall not constitute a general waiver of such term, provision or covenant or of any subsequent act contrary thereto.&#160;&#160;any liability to any party under the provisions of this agreement may be released, compounded or compromised by such party in its absolute discretion as regards any party or parties under such liability without in any way prejudicing its rights against any other party or parties under the same or a like liability, whether joint and several or otherwise. &#160; &#160; 13. references to the buyers &#160; &#160; 13.1&#160; the prior consent of each buyer will be required prior to the release or publication of any document or announcement to be executed, published or filed in connection with the buyer transactions that refers to that buyer, or refers to any actions that are contemplated or have been or will be taken by that buyer ( "relevant documents" ). &#160;

&#160; &#160; 13.2.1&#160;&#160; afford the buyers such time as they may reasonably require to consider the relevant documents to give such consent; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 13.2.2 submit drafts and revised drafts of the relevant documents for review and comment by each buyer, and having afforded each buyer appropriate time pursuant to clause 13.2.1 to consider such drafts, discuss such comments with the buyers for the purposes of preparing revised drafts. &#160; &#160; 14. entire agreement &#160; &#160; &#160; this agreement (together with the stock purchase agreement and the ccn agreement to the extent that the parties hereto are party thereto) contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the transactions provided for in this agreement and supersedes all previous representations, arrangements, undertakings and agreements (if any) between the &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; parties in respect of such matters.&#160;&#160;each of the parties acknowledges that in agreeing to enter into this agreement it has not relied on any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant, pre-contractual statement or understanding other than those contained in this agreement and/or the stock purchase agreement and/or the ccn agreement. &#160;

&#160; &#160; the commission&#8217;s liability to pay the transaction fee shall arise immediately upon each completion date, whereupon a part of the transaction fee determined according to the aggregate amount of the consideration payable by the buyers upon such completion date shall be due.&#160;&#160;the relevant part of the transaction fee shall be payable in every case by deduction by the buyer entitled thereto of the amount thereof from the consideration payable by it upon such completion.. &#160; &#160; 16. general &#160; &#160; 16.1 any liability to any party under this agreement may in whole or in part be released, compounded or compromised and time or indulgence may be given by any party in its absolute discretion as regards any other person under such liability without in any way prejudicing or affecting the first party's rights against such other person under the same or a similar liability, whether joint and several or otherwise. &#160;

&#160; 16.5 no variation of this agreement will be effective unless in writing (not including e-mail) and signed by or on behalf of each of the parties. &#160; &#160; 16.6&#160; if at any time any provision of this agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, that will not affect or impair: &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.6.1&#160;&#160; the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this agreement; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.6.2 the legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this agreement. &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; if any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision of this agreement would be valid, enforceable and legal if some part of it were deleted, the parties will negotiate in good faith to amend such provision such that, as amended, it is legal, valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the parties original commercial intention. &#160;

(as such term is defined in &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; rule&#160;405 under the securities act) prepared by the company or authorized by it in writing for use by such holder (or any amendment or supplement thereto);

and shall keep the company informed of, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the company in relation to, all material developments in respect thereof, but in each case, only insofar as may be consistent with the terms of any relevant insurance policy and provided (in each case) that to do so would not, in such indemnitee&#8217;s view (acting in good faith), be prejudicial to it (or to any indemnitee connected to it) or to any obligation of confidentiality or other legal or regulatory obligation which that indemnitee owes to any third party or to any regulatory request that has been made of it.&#160;&#160;however, the failure to so notify the company and keep the company informed shall not relieve the company from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve the company from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of the indemnity set out in this section&#160;2.9. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;legal advisers for indemnitees shall be selected by the company in consultation with the indemnitees. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in no event shall the company be liable for fees and expenses of more than one legal adviser (in addition to any local legal advisers) separate from its own legal advisers for the holders in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the company shall have the sole right to conduct and settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this section&#160;2.9 (whether or not the indemnitees are actual or potential parties thereto), provided that (i) such rights are exercised in good faith; (ii) that no settlement, compromise or consent shall be entered into without reasonable consultation with the relevant indemnitee; (iii) it shall obtain the consent of an indemnitee in respect of any such settlement, compromise or consent that includes a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnitee (provided such consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). &#160;

the period from and including the interest commencement date to (but excluding) the first interest payment date, and each successive period from and including an interest payment date to (but excluding) the next succeeding interest payment date, or if earlier, the maturity date or the conversion date is called an &#8220; interest period &#8221;. &#160; &#160; (b) interest accrual &#160; interest accrues on each ccn from day to day from (and including) the interest commencement date to (but excluding) the date on which such ccn has been redeemed in full. each ccn will cease to bear interest from and including the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation of the relevant certificate, payment of the principal in respect of such ccn is improperly withheld or refused or unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment. in such event, interest will continue to accrue until whichever is the earlier of: &#160; &#160; (i) the date upon which all amounts due in respect of such ccn has been paid; &#160; &#160; (ii) five days after the date on which the full amount of the moneys in respect of such ccn has been received by the fiscal agent and notice to that effect has been given to the holders; and &#160; &#160; (iii) in the case of a conversion (as defined below), the conversion date. &#160; &#160; (c) fixed rate of interest &#160; subject to condition 3(g), interest is payable on each interest payment date at a rate of 10.00 per cent. per annum (the &#8220; rate of interest &#8221;) and shall be calculated by the calculation agent in accordance with the agency deed on each interest payment date in respect of each ccn. &#160; &#160; (d) calculations &#160; if interest is required to be calculated for a period other than a complete interest period, the day count fraction used will be the actual number of days in the relevant &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; period divided by the actual number of days in the interest period in which such payment falls (including the first such day but excluding the last). &#160; &#160; (e) notifications to be final &#160; all notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of these conditions by the calculation agent will, in the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on the issuer, the fiscal agent and the holders and in the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error, no liability to the issuer, the fiscal agent or the holders shall attach to the calculation agent in connection with&#160;&#160;exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions under these conditions. &#160; &#160; (f) no deferral &#160; the issuer shall not be entitled to defer or cancel any payments of interest or any other amounts payable in respect of the ccns. &#160; &#160; (g) remarketing option &#160; &#160; (i) for as long as the initial holder is holder of 100 per cent. of the ccns, the initial holder may, at any time, increase the rate of interest on the ccns (such increased rate, the &#8220; new interest rate &#8221;) as determined by an independent investment bank appointed by the initial holder (the &#8220; remarketing agent &#8221;) but with effect only from the date that the ccns are sold by the initial holder to any other person other than any state entity (a &#8220; third party sale &#8221;). &#160; &#160; (ii) for the purposes of this condition 3(g), the new interest rate will not exceed 18.00 per cent. per annum. &#160; &#160; (iii) the initial holder will provide at least 15 business days notice in writing to the issuer of any proposed third party sale or such longer period as may be approved in writing by the initial holder. during such period, the issuer may solicit other third party investors, at a potentially lower interest rate than the rate described in condition 3(g)(ii), to whom the entire principal amount of the ccns may be sold at an equivalent or higher price than the initial holder would receive for any proposed third party sale. &#160; &#160; (iv) notwithstanding any other provision of these conditions or the agency deed to the contrary, the initial holder shall have absolute discretion as to whether to sell the ccns, to whom it may sell the ccns and the terms of any such sale. &#160; &#160; (v) the issuer shall, if required by the initial holder: (a) disclose to the initial holder the identity of any third party investors solicited or to be solicited by the issuer pursuant to condition 3(g)(iii) and (b) provide and/or disclose all such information necessary, as determined by the initial holder in its absolute discretion, to facilitate the effecting of a third party sale. &#160; &#160; (h) maintenance of agents &#160; the issuer shall ensure that, so long as any of the ccns remain outstanding, there shall at all times be a calculation agent and a fiscal agent having its office in a &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; european city (other than ireland) and not operating through a branch in ireland, and that, if the issuer or the fiscal agent would be required to withhold or deduct tax in respect of payments on the ccns, the issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a fiscal agent in a member state of the european union (other than ireland) that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to european council directive 2003/48/ec on the taxation of savings or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to confirm to, such directive. &#160; 4. conversion &#160; &#160; (a) conversion upon a conversion event &#160; &#160; (i) if a conversion event shall occur at any time while the ccns are outstanding, each ccn shall, subject to and as provided in this condition 4, be immediately and mandatorily redeemed as of the conversion date and settled (such redemption and settlement being the &#8220; conversion &#8221; and the term &#8220; converted &#8221; shall be construed accordingly) by the allotment, issue and delivery by the issuer of fully paid ordinary stock to the holders on the date specified in the conversion notice (as defined below), which date shall be no later than 20 business days following the conversion date (the &#8220; conversion settlement date &#8221;).&#160;&#160;subject to condition 4(c), receipt by the holders of the ordinary stock and accrued conversion interest (if any) shall be a good and complete discharge of the issuer&#8217;s obligations in respect of the ccns. &#160; &#160; (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of the conversion event, the issuer shall give notice thereof to holders (the &#8220; conversion notice &#8221;) in accordance with condition 13. the conversion notice shall specify the circumstances giving rise to the conversion event, the conversion price and the conversion settlement date. &#160; &#160; (iii) if a conversion event occurs, the ccns will be converted in whole and not in part as provided in accordance with this condition 4(a). ccns so converted shall be automatically cancelled by the issuer and may not be held, reissued or resold. &#160; &#160; (iv) except on the occurrence of a conversion event, the ccns are not convertible into ordinary stock at the option of holders at any time and are not redeemable in cash as a result of a conversion event. &#160; &#160; (v) no conversion notice shall be given and no conversion shall occur following a capital deficiency event if, notwithstanding the capital ratio being below the trigger ratio, the competent authority, at the request of the issuer, has agreed, in its absolute discretion, that a conversion shall not occur because it is satisfied that actions, circumstances or events have had, or imminently will have during the next 90 days following such capital deficiency event, the effect of restoring the capital ratio to a level above the trigger ratio that the competent authority deems to be adequate at such time. &#160; &#160; (vi) notwithstanding condition 4(a)(v), a conversion event will immediately occur if the competent authority determines, in its absolute discretion, that at any time after agreeing under condition 4(a)(v) that no conversion event shall occur, the issuer will not be able to restore the capital ratio to a level above the trigger ratio that the competent authority deems to be adequate at such time. &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; (b) accrued conversion interest &#160; &#160; (i) upon conversion, accrued conversion interest shall become due and payable on the conversion date and the issuer shall pay to the holders the accrued conversion interest (if any) in respect of the ccns on the conversion settlement date. &#160; &#160; (ii) payment of any accrued conversion interest will be made in cash by transfer to an account with a bank in a city in which banks have access to the target system, as specified by the relevant holder. &#160; &#160; (c) conversion price &#160; &#160; (i) upon conversion, each holder shall be deemed to have accepted the conversion of its holding of ccns into ordinary stock at the conversion price and that the issuer shall effect such conversion on behalf of such holder. such ordinary stock will be deemed to be credited as fully paid up and allotted, issued and delivered as of the conversion date, whereupon each holder shall cease as a matter of irish law to be treated for all purposes under irish law as a holder and shall instead as of such date be treated for all purposes under irish law as a stockholder. &#160; &#160; (ii) the issuer shall, not later than the conversion settlement date, allot and issue or deliver such number of units of ordinary stock to the holders in respect of each ccn as is determined by dividing the principal amount of such ccn by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. &#160; &#160; (iii) the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment in the circumstances provided in condition 4(e) for the adjustment of the floor price (with such modifications and amendments as an independent financial adviser acting in good faith shall determine to be appropriate) and the issuer shall give notice to holders of the new floor price and of any such modifications and amendments thereafter. &#160; &#160; (d) conversion on a takeover event &#160; &#160; (i) if a qualifying takeover event shall occur then the ccns shall, where the conversion date falls on or after the takeover event date, be convertible into approved entity shares upon the occurrence of a conversion event, mutatis mutandis as provided in accordance with this condition 4, at a conversion price that shall be the new conversion price. &#160; &#160; (ii) the new conversion price shall be subject to adjustment in the circumstances provided in condition 4(e) for the adjustment of the floor price (if necessary with such modifications and amendments as an independent financial adviser acting in good faith shall determine to be appropriate) and the issuer shall give notice to holders of the new conversion price and of any such modifications and amendments thereafter. &#160; &#160; (iii) if a non-qualifying takeover event shall occur then, with effect from the occurrence of such takeover event and unless a conversion event shall have occurred prior to such date, any outstanding ccns shall remain the obligation of the issuer and shall, upon the occurrence of a conversion event, be convertible into ordinary stock in accordance with this condition 4 but shall &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; not be convertible into approved entity shares at any time notwithstanding that a conversion event may occur subsequently. &#160; &#160; (iv) in the case of a qualifying takeover event: &#160; &#160; (1) the issuer shall, on or prior to the takeover event date, enter into such agreements and arrangements, (which may include deeds supplemental to these conditions and amendments and modifications to these conditions) as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the takeover event date, the ccns will be convertible into approved entity shares of the approved entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this condition 4 (as may be so supplemented, amended or modified) at a price equal to the new conversion price and that subject to such conversion the ccns shall remain the obligations of the issuer; and &#160; &#160; (2) the issuer shall, where the conversion date falls on or after the takeover event date, procure the allotment and issue and/or delivery of the relevant number of approved entity shares in the manner provided in this condition 4, as may be amended or modified as provided above. &#160; &#160; (v) within 10 business days following the occurrence of a takeover event, the issuer shall give notice thereof in accordance with condition 13 to the holders (a &#8220; takeover event notice &#8221;), which shall specify. &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the identity of the acquirer; &#160; &#160; (2) whether the takeover event is a qualifying takeover event or a non-qualifying takeover event; &#160; &#160; (3) in the case of a qualifying takeover event, if determined at such time, the new conversion price; and &#160; &#160; (4) in the case of a qualifying takeover event, the takeover event date. &#160; &#160; (e) adjustments to the floor price &#160; upon the happening of any of the events described below, the floor price shall be adjusted, unless, for as long as the initial holder is a holder of 100 per cent. of the ccns, the initial holder within six months of the issue date agrees that no adjustment is required, as follows: &#160; &#160; (i) increase of share capital by means of capitalisation of reserves, profits or premia by distribution of ordinary stock, or division or consolidation of ordinary stock &#160; subject to condition 4(f), in the event of a change in the issuer&#8217;s share capital as a result of the capitalisation of reserves, profits or premia by means of the distribution of ordinary stock or as a result of the division or consolidation of the ordinary stock, the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such change by the result of the following formula: &#160; n old / n new &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; where: &#160; &#160; n old is the number of units of ordinary stock existing before the change in share capital; and &#160; &#160; n new is the number of units of ordinary stock existing after the change in share capital; &#160; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if ordinary stock are issued in lieu of the whole or any part of a cash dividend, or another cash distribution made in lieu of a dividend, which the stockholders concerned would or could otherwise have received. such adjustment shall become effective on the date on which such ordinary stock are traded ex-the relevant entitlement on the primary stock exchange. &#160; &#160; (ii) issues of ordinary stock or other securities to stockholders by way of conferring subscription or purchase rights &#160; subject to condition 4(f), if (a) the issuer issues or grants to stockholders any rights or options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or acquire ordinary stock, other securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities or (b) any third party, with the agreement of the issuer, issues to holders of ordinary stock any rights, options or warrants to purchase any ordinary stock, other securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities (the rights referred to in (a) and (b) collectively and individually being the &#8220; purchase rights &#8221;), the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the result of the following formula: &#160; (p cum &#8211; r) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day immediately preceding the first date on which the ordinary stock is first traded ex-the relevant purchase rights on the primary stock exchange or (y) the dealing day when the price for the relevant purchase rights is announced, or if the day the subscription or purchase price is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day; and &#160; &#160; r is the value of the relevant purchase rights relating to one unit of ordinary stock or other security, such value to be calculated as follows: &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the purchase rights relate to ordinary stock &#160; r = p cum &#8211; terp &#160; where: &#160; terp&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= (n old x p cum + n new x (p rights + div)) / (n old + n new ) &#160; and: &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; terp&#160;&#160;&#160;is the theoretical ex-rights price; and &#160; &#160; n old is the number of units of ordinary stock existing before the change in share capital; and &#160; &#160; n new is the number of units of ordinary stock being newly issued; and &#160; &#160; p rights is the price at which one new unit of ordinary stock can be subscribed, exercised or purchased for; and &#160; &#160; div is the amount (in euro) by which the dividend entitlement per unit of ordinary stock exceeds the dividend entitlement per new unit of ordinary stock, (x) if dividends have already been proposed to the general meeting of shareholders but not yet paid, based on the proposed dividend amount, or (y) if dividends have not yet been proposed based on the last paid dividend; &#160; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the subscription or purchase price at which one new unit of ordinary stock can be subscribed or purchased is at least 95 per cent. of p cum (as defined above); &#160; &#160; (2) if the purchase rights relate to other securities or to securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities and where such purchase rights, or other securities are traded on a regulated stock exchange in the european union, the united states of america, canada or japan: &#160; r = n rights x p rights &#160; where: &#160; &#160; n rights is the number of purchase rights granted per unit of ordinary stock; and &#160; &#160; p rights is the average of the last paid prices on the primary stock exchange (in euro) (or, if no dealing is recorded, the arithmetic mean of the bid and offered prices) on a spot basis of one purchase right on each dealing day during the period the purchase rights are traded or, if such period is longer than ten dealing days, the arithmetic average of the last paid prices (or, if no dealing is recorded, the arithmetic mean of the bid and offered prices) on a spot basis on the first ten such dealing days; or &#160; &#160; (3) in all other cases where neither of the previous paragraphs (1) or (2) is applicable: &#160; r will be determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; such adjustment shall become effective: &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; (i) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(1) apply, on the date on which the ordinary stock are traded ex-purchase rights on the primary stock exchange or, if the subscription or exercise price is announced only at a later time, one dealing day after the announcement of the price of the purchase right; &#160; &#160; (ii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(2) apply, five dealing days after (x) the end of the subscription or purchase period or (y) the tenth day of the subscription or purchase period, whichever is the sooner; and &#160; &#160; (iii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(3) apply, on the date determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; &#160; (iii) capital distributions &#160; subject to condition 4(f), if and whenever any capital distribution shall be made or paid to stockholders, the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to the effective date by the following fraction: &#160; (p cum &#8211; d) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day immediately preceding the effective date or (y) the dealing day when the relevant dividend is announced (or, if the day on which the amount of the relevant dividend is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day); and &#160; &#160; d is the portion of the fair market value of the aggregate capital distribution attributable to one unit of ordinary stock, with such portion being determined by dividing the fair market value of the aggregate capital distribution on the effective date by the number of units of ordinary stock entitled to receive the relevant dividend (or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of ordinary stock (or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing ordinary stock) by or on behalf of the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer, by the number of units of ordinary stock in issue immediately following such purchase, redemption or buy back, and treating as not being in issue any ordinary stock (or any ordinary stock represented by depositary or other receipts or certificates) so purchased, redeemed or bought back). &#160; such adjustment shall become effective on the effective date or, if later, the first date upon which the fair market value of the relevant capital distribution is capable of being determined as provided herein. &#160; &#160; (iv) non-cash dividends &#160; subject to condition 4(f), in respect of a non-cash dividend, the floor price shall be adjusted as follows: &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; (1) where the non-cash dividend in question (x) consists of securities that are traded on a regulated stock exchange in the european union, the united states of america, canada or japan or (y) has otherwise a value which is determinable by reference to a stock exchange quotation or otherwise, by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such non-cash dividend by the result of the following formula: &#160; (p cum &#8211; d) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day preceding the date on which the ordinary stock is first traded ex-the relevant non-cash dividend on the primary stock exchange or (y) the dealing day when the amount of the relevant non-cash dividend is announced (or, if the day on which the amount of the relevant non-cash dividend is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day); and &#160; &#160; d is the portion of the fair market value of the relevant non-cash dividend (in euro) on the dealing day immediately following the date in respect of which p cum (as defined above) has been determined; and &#160; &#160; (2) in all other cases, by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such issue or distribution by the result of the following formula: &#160; p after / p before &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p after is the arithmetic average of the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock on the first five consecutive dealing days starting on the dealing day immediately following the first dealing day on which the ordinary stock are traded ex-the relevant non-cash dividend (the &#8220; distribution date &#8221;); and &#160; &#160; p before is arithmetic average of the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock on the five consecutive dealing days ending on the dealing day immediately preceding the distribution date, &#160; as determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; such adjustment shall become effective: &#160; &#160; (i) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(iv)(1) apply, on the date on which the relevant non-cash dividend is made; and &#160; &#160; (ii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(iv)(2) apply, five dealing days after the distribution date. &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; (v) other events &#160; if the issuer determines that, notwithstanding paragraphs (i) to (iv) of this condition 4(e), an adjustment should be made to the floor price as a result of one or more of the events or circumstances not referred to in this condition 4(e) or circumstances have arisen which might have an adverse effect on the right of the holders upon conversion of the ccns and no adjustment of the floor price under this condition 4(e) would otherwise arise, the issuer shall engage the advice or services of an independent financial adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment, if any, to the floor price or amendment, if any, to the terms of this condition 4 is fair and reasonable to take into account thereof and the date on which such adjustment should take effect.&#160;&#160;the independent financial adviser shall have no responsibility to make any enquiries as to whether or not any event has occurred which might require an adjustment to the floor price or amendment, if any, to the terms of this condition 4. &#160; notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this condition 4(e)(v): &#160; &#160; (1) where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this condition 4(e) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the floor price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the floor price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the floor price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result; &#160; &#160; (2) such modification shall be made to the operation of the ccns as may be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser to be in its opinion appropriate (i) to ensure that an adjustment to the floor price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into account more than once and (ii) to ensure that the economic effect of a dividend is not taken into account more than once; &#160; &#160; (3) for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of ordinary stock upon a conversion or upon any conversion or exchange in respect of any other securities or the exercise of any other options, warrants or other rights shall not result in an adjustment to the floor price; and &#160; &#160; (4) at any time when the ordinary stock are not admitted to trading on a recognised stock exchange, the floor price shall be adjusted as provided above save that for the purposes thereof the current market price, the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock and the date upon which any adjustment becomes effective shall be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser in such manner as it considers appropriate to ensure that an adjustment to the floor price is made which gives the intended same result as if the ordinary stock we so admitted to trading. &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; notice of any adjustments to the floor price pursuant to this condition 4(e)(v) shall be given by the issuer in accordance with condition 13 to holders promptly after the determination thereof. &#160; the floor price shall not in any event be reduced to below the prevailing nominal value of the ordinary stock at the effective date of such adjustment. the issuer shall not take any action, and procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the floor price to an amount below such nominal value. &#160; &#160; (f) events not giving rise to adjustments &#160; notwithstanding the provisions of condition 4(e), no adjustment to the floor price will be made: &#160; &#160; (i) as a result of any issue or distribution of new ordinary stock or other securities if the pre-emptive right in respect thereof has been validly excluded by a non-routine resolution of the general meeting of stockholders unless a pre-emptive right in respect thereof is granted indirectly to the stockholders by a third party with the agreement of the issuer. for the purpose of these conditions, the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights conferred by way of special resolution proposed at each annual general meeting of the issuer shall not constitute a non-routine resolution; or &#160; &#160; (ii) as a result of any public issue of bonds convertible into ordinary stock or bonds with options to subscribe for ordinary stock, such issue being in connection with a conditional increase of the share capital of the issuer, irrespective of whether in respect of such issue the advance subscription rights to acquire such bonds have been excluded or not, unless advance subscription rights have been granted and are traded on the primary stock exchange; or &#160; &#160; (iii) if, as a result of any non-cash dividend by the issuer, the issuer sells any share, right, warrant or other security representing the same (an &#8220; interest &#8221;) in any of its subsidiaries to holders of the ordinary stock at fair value, and for this purpose: &#160; &#160; (1) where such interest is listed on, traded on, or dealt in any stock exchange, the fair value of such interest shall be at least 95 per cent. of the average of the last paid prices therefor on such stock exchange (or, if more than one, the principal such stock exchange) on each of the ten dealing days commencing on the twentieth dealing day before the day on which the issuer officially announces the terms and conditions for such sale, as determined by an independent financial adviser; and &#160; &#160; (2) where such interest is not so listed, traded or dealt in, the fair value of such interest shall be at least 95 per cent. of the fair market value thereof; or &#160; &#160; (iv) if an increase in the floor price would result from such adjustment, except in case of an exchange of the ordinary stock for other securities or a consolidation of ordinary stock. &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; (g) decision of an independent financial adviser &#160; &#160; (i) if any doubt shall arise as to whether an adjustment falls to be made to the floor price or the conversion price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the floor price, and following consultation between the issuer and an independent financial adviser, a written opinion of such independent financial adviser in respect thereof shall be conclusive and binding on the issuer and the holders, save in the case of manifest error. &#160; &#160; (ii) if the independent financial adviser does not at any time for any reason make any determination or calculate any adjustment in the circumstances provided for in this condition 4 then the holders shall, at the expense of the issuer, be entitled to appoint an agent to do so, and such determination or calculation shall be deemed to have been made by the independent financial adviser. in doing so, the holders&#8217; agent shall apply the foregoing provisions of condition 4, with any necessary consequential amendments, to the extent that, in its opinion, it can do so, and in all other respects it shall do so in such manner as it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. &#160;

in addition, if and for so long as the ccns are listed on the irish stock exchange or any other recognised stock exchange, notices shall be given in accordance with any requirement of such exchange. &#160; any notice or notification (however expressed) to be given to the issuer by any holder shall be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting a letter by registered post containing the notice and shall be deemed to have been given on the second business day after the date of posting. &#160;

&#160; 37 &#160; a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holder or holders of not less than 75 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the ccns outstanding shall for all purposes be as valid and effective as an extraordinary resolution passed at a meeting of holders duly convened and held. such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more holders. &#160; &#160; (b) modification &#160; no modification to these conditions or any other provisions of the agency deed (whether pursuant to this condition 14 or otherwise) shall become effective unless the issuer shall have received written approval from the competent authority (provided that, at the relevant time, there is a requirement to obtain such approval). &#160;

&#160; (c) consent &#160; where these conditions require the prior consent or approval of the holders, such consent or approval shall for all purposes be deemed to be valid and effective if in writing signed by or on behalf of the holder or holders of in excess of 50.00 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the ccns outstanding or if given by way of an extraordinary resolution. &#160; 15. transfers of ccns &#160; &#160; (a) transfer of ccns &#160; one or more ccns may be transferred upon the surrender (at the specified office of the registrar) of the certificate representing such ccns to be transferred, together with the form of transfer endorsed on such certificate (or another form of transfer substantially in the same form and containing the same representations and certifications (if any), unless otherwise agreed by the issuer), duly completed and executed and any other evidence as the registrar may reasonably require. a new certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect of the ccns the subject of the relevant transfer and, in the case of a transfer of part only of a holding of ccns represented by one certificate, a new certificate in respect of the balance of the ccns not transferred shall be issued to the transferor. in the case of a transfer of ccns to a person who is already a holder, a new certificate representing the enlarged holding may be issued but only against surrender of the certificate representing the existing holding of such person. all transfers of ccns and entries on the register will be made subject to the detailed regulations concerning transfers of ccns scheduled to the agency deed. the regulations may be changed by the issuer, with the prior written approval of the registrar. a copy of the current regulations will be made available by the registrar to any holder upon request. &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; (b) delivery of new certificates &#160; each new certificate to be issued pursuant to condition 15(a) shall be available for delivery within three business days of receipt of the form of transfer and surrender of the relevant certificate.&#160;&#160;delivery of new certificate(s) shall be made at the specified office of the registrar to whom delivery and surrender of such form of transfer and certificate or, as the case may be, surrender of such certificate, shall have been made or, at the option of the relevant holder and as specified in the relevant form of transfer or otherwise in writing, be mailed by uninsured post at the risk of the holder entitled to the new certificate to such address as may be so specified, unless such holder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the relevant registrar the costs of such other method of delivery and/or such insurance as it may specify. &#160; &#160; (c) transfers free of charge &#160; transfers of ccns and the issue of new certificates on transfer shall be effected without charge by or on behalf of the issuer or the registrar, but upon payment by the transferee of any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to it (or the giving of such indemnity as the registrar may require). &#160;

&#160; (v) no conversion notice shall be given and no conversion shall occur following a capital deficiency event if, notwithstanding the capital ratio being below the trigger ratio, the competent authority, at the request of the issuer, has agreed, in its absolute discretion, that a conversion shall not occur because it is satisfied that actions, circumstances or events have had, or imminently will have during the next 90 days following such capital deficiency event, the effect of restoring the capital ratio to a level above the trigger ratio that the competent authority deems to be adequate at such time. &#160; &#160; (vi) notwithstanding condition 4(a)(v), a conversion event will immediately occur if the competent authority determines, in its absolute discretion, that at any time after agreeing under condition 4(a)(v) that no conversion event shall occur, the issuer will not be able to restore the capital ratio to a level above the trigger ratio that the competent authority deems to be adequate at such time. &#160;

&#160; (ii) the issuer shall, not later than the conversion settlement date, allot and issue or deliver such number of units of ordinary stock to the holders in respect of each ccn as is determined by dividing the principal amount of such ccn by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. &#160; &#160; (iii) the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment in the circumstances provided in condition 4(e) for the adjustment of the floor price (with such modifications and amendments as an independent financial adviser acting in good faith shall determine to be appropriate) and the issuer shall give notice to holders of the new floor price and of any such modifications and amendments thereafter. &#160; &#160; (d) conversion on a takeover event &#160; &#160; (i) if a qualifying takeover event shall occur then the ccns shall, where the conversion date falls on or after the takeover event date, be convertible into approved entity shares upon the occurrence of a conversion event, mutatis mutandis as provided in accordance with this condition 4, at a conversion price that shall be the new conversion price. &#160; &#160; (ii) the new conversion price shall be subject to adjustment in the circumstances provided in condition 4(e) for the adjustment of the floor price (if necessary with such modifications and amendments as an independent financial adviser acting in good faith shall determine to be appropriate) and the issuer shall give notice to holders of the new conversion price and of any such modifications and amendments thereafter. &#160; &#160; (iii) if a non-qualifying takeover event shall occur then, with effect from the occurrence of such takeover event and unless a conversion event shall have occurred prior to such date, any outstanding ccns shall remain the obligation of the issuer and shall, upon the occurrence of a conversion event, be convertible into ordinary stock in accordance with this condition 4 but shall &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; not be convertible into approved entity shares at any time notwithstanding that a conversion event may occur subsequently. &#160; &#160; (iv) in the case of a qualifying takeover event: &#160; &#160; (1) the issuer shall, on or prior to the takeover event date, enter into such agreements and arrangements, (which may include deeds supplemental to these conditions and amendments and modifications to these conditions) as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the takeover event date, the ccns will be convertible into approved entity shares of the approved entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this condition 4 (as may be so supplemented, amended or modified) at a price equal to the new conversion price and that subject to such conversion the ccns shall remain the obligations of the issuer; and &#160; &#160; (2) the issuer shall, where the conversion date falls on or after the takeover event date, procure the allotment and issue and/or delivery of the relevant number of approved entity shares in the manner provided in this condition 4, as may be amended or modified as provided above. &#160; &#160; (v) within 10 business days following the occurrence of a takeover event, the issuer shall give notice thereof in accordance with condition 13 to the holders (a &#8220; takeover event notice &#8221;), which shall specify. &#160; &#160; (1) the identity of the acquirer; &#160; &#160; (2) whether the takeover event is a qualifying takeover event or a non-qualifying takeover event; &#160; &#160; (3) in the case of a qualifying takeover event, if determined at such time, the new conversion price; and &#160; &#160; (4) in the case of a qualifying takeover event, the takeover event date. &#160; &#160; (e) adjustments to the floor price &#160; upon the happening of any of the events described below, the floor price shall be adjusted, unless, for as long as the initial holder is a holder of 100 per cent. of the ccns, the initial holder within six months of the issue date agrees that no adjustment is required, as follows: &#160; &#160; (i) increase of share capital by means of capitalisation of reserves, profits or premia by distribution of ordinary stock, or division or consolidation of ordinary stock &#160; subject to condition 4(f), in the event of a change in the issuer&#8217;s share capital as a result of the capitalisation of reserves, profits or premia by means of the distribution of ordinary stock or as a result of the division or consolidation of the ordinary stock, the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such change by the result of the following formula: &#160; n old / n new &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; where: &#160; &#160; n old is the number of units of ordinary stock existing before the change in share capital; and &#160; &#160; n new is the number of units of ordinary stock existing after the change in share capital; &#160; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if ordinary stock are issued in lieu of the whole or any part of a cash dividend, or another cash distribution made in lieu of a dividend, which the stockholders concerned would or could otherwise have received. such adjustment shall become effective on the date on which such ordinary stock are traded ex-the relevant entitlement on the primary stock exchange. &#160; &#160; (ii) issues of ordinary stock or other securities to stockholders by way of conferring subscription or purchase rights &#160; subject to condition 4(f), if (a) the issuer issues or grants to stockholders any rights or options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or acquire ordinary stock, other securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities or (b) any third party, with the agreement of the issuer, issues to holders of ordinary stock any rights, options or warrants to purchase any ordinary stock, other securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities (the rights referred to in (a) and (b) collectively and individually being the &#8220; purchase rights &#8221;), the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the result of the following formula: &#160; (p cum &#8211; r) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day immediately preceding the first date on which the ordinary stock is first traded ex-the relevant purchase rights on the primary stock exchange or (y) the dealing day when the price for the relevant purchase rights is announced, or if the day the subscription or purchase price is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day; and &#160; &#160; r is the value of the relevant purchase rights relating to one unit of ordinary stock or other security, such value to be calculated as follows: &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the purchase rights relate to ordinary stock &#160; r = p cum &#8211; terp &#160; where: &#160; terp&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;= (n old x p cum + n new x (p rights + div)) / (n old + n new ) &#160; and: &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; terp&#160;&#160;&#160;is the theoretical ex-rights price; and &#160; &#160; n old is the number of units of ordinary stock existing before the change in share capital; and &#160; &#160; n new is the number of units of ordinary stock being newly issued; and &#160; &#160; p rights is the price at which one new unit of ordinary stock can be subscribed, exercised or purchased for; and &#160; &#160; div is the amount (in euro) by which the dividend entitlement per unit of ordinary stock exceeds the dividend entitlement per new unit of ordinary stock, (x) if dividends have already been proposed to the general meeting of shareholders but not yet paid, based on the proposed dividend amount, or (y) if dividends have not yet been proposed based on the last paid dividend; &#160; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the subscription or purchase price at which one new unit of ordinary stock can be subscribed or purchased is at least 95 per cent. of p cum (as defined above); &#160; &#160; (2) if the purchase rights relate to other securities or to securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary stock or other securities and where such purchase rights, or other securities are traded on a regulated stock exchange in the european union, the united states of america, canada or japan: &#160; r = n rights x p rights &#160; where: &#160; &#160; n rights is the number of purchase rights granted per unit of ordinary stock; and &#160; &#160; p rights is the average of the last paid prices on the primary stock exchange (in euro) (or, if no dealing is recorded, the arithmetic mean of the bid and offered prices) on a spot basis of one purchase right on each dealing day during the period the purchase rights are traded or, if such period is longer than ten dealing days, the arithmetic average of the last paid prices (or, if no dealing is recorded, the arithmetic mean of the bid and offered prices) on a spot basis on the first ten such dealing days; or &#160; &#160; (3) in all other cases where neither of the previous paragraphs (1) or (2) is applicable: &#160; r will be determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; such adjustment shall become effective: &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; (i) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(1) apply, on the date on which the ordinary stock are traded ex-purchase rights on the primary stock exchange or, if the subscription or exercise price is announced only at a later time, one dealing day after the announcement of the price of the purchase right; &#160; &#160; (ii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(2) apply, five dealing days after (x) the end of the subscription or purchase period or (y) the tenth day of the subscription or purchase period, whichever is the sooner; and &#160; &#160; (iii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(ii)(3) apply, on the date determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; &#160; (iii) capital distributions &#160; subject to condition 4(f), if and whenever any capital distribution shall be made or paid to stockholders, the floor price shall be adjusted by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to the effective date by the following fraction: &#160; (p cum &#8211; d) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day immediately preceding the effective date or (y) the dealing day when the relevant dividend is announced (or, if the day on which the amount of the relevant dividend is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day); and &#160; &#160; d is the portion of the fair market value of the aggregate capital distribution attributable to one unit of ordinary stock, with such portion being determined by dividing the fair market value of the aggregate capital distribution on the effective date by the number of units of ordinary stock entitled to receive the relevant dividend (or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of ordinary stock (or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing ordinary stock) by or on behalf of the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer, by the number of units of ordinary stock in issue immediately following such purchase, redemption or buy back, and treating as not being in issue any ordinary stock (or any ordinary stock represented by depositary or other receipts or certificates) so purchased, redeemed or bought back). &#160; such adjustment shall become effective on the effective date or, if later, the first date upon which the fair market value of the relevant capital distribution is capable of being determined as provided herein. &#160; &#160; (iv) non-cash dividends &#160; subject to condition 4(f), in respect of a non-cash dividend, the floor price shall be adjusted as follows: &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; (1) where the non-cash dividend in question (x) consists of securities that are traded on a regulated stock exchange in the european union, the united states of america, canada or japan or (y) has otherwise a value which is determinable by reference to a stock exchange quotation or otherwise, by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such non-cash dividend by the result of the following formula: &#160; (p cum &#8211; d) / p cum &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p cum is the vwap of one unit of ordinary stock on whichever is the later of (x) the last dealing day preceding the date on which the ordinary stock is first traded ex-the relevant non-cash dividend on the primary stock exchange or (y) the dealing day when the amount of the relevant non-cash dividend is announced (or, if the day on which the amount of the relevant non-cash dividend is announced is not a dealing day, the next following dealing day); and &#160; &#160; d is the portion of the fair market value of the relevant non-cash dividend (in euro) on the dealing day immediately following the date in respect of which p cum (as defined above) has been determined; and &#160; &#160; (2) in all other cases, by multiplying the floor price in force immediately prior to such issue or distribution by the result of the following formula: &#160; p after / p before &#160; where: &#160; &#160; p after is the arithmetic average of the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock on the first five consecutive dealing days starting on the dealing day immediately following the first dealing day on which the ordinary stock are traded ex-the relevant non-cash dividend (the &#8220; distribution date &#8221;); and &#160; &#160; p before is arithmetic average of the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock on the five consecutive dealing days ending on the dealing day immediately preceding the distribution date, &#160; as determined by an independent financial adviser. &#160; such adjustment shall become effective: &#160; &#160; (i) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(iv)(1) apply, on the date on which the relevant non-cash dividend is made; and &#160; &#160; (ii) where the provisions of condition 4(e)(iv)(2) apply, five dealing days after the distribution date. &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; (v) other events &#160; if the issuer determines that, notwithstanding paragraphs (i) to (iv) of this condition 4(e), an adjustment should be made to the floor price as a result of one or more of the events or circumstances not referred to in this condition 4(e) or circumstances have arisen which might have an adverse effect on the right of the holders upon conversion of the ccns and no adjustment of the floor price under this condition 4(e) would otherwise arise, the issuer shall engage the advice or services of an independent financial adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment, if any, to the floor price or amendment, if any, to the terms of this condition 4 is fair and reasonable to take into account thereof and the date on which such adjustment should take effect.&#160;&#160;the independent financial adviser shall have no responsibility to make any enquiries as to whether or not any event has occurred which might require an adjustment to the floor price or amendment, if any, to the terms of this condition 4. &#160; notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this condition 4(e)(v): &#160; &#160; (1) where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this condition 4(e) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the floor price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the floor price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the floor price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result; &#160; &#160; (2) such modification shall be made to the operation of the ccns as may be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser to be in its opinion appropriate (i) to ensure that an adjustment to the floor price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into account more than once and (ii) to ensure that the economic effect of a dividend is not taken into account more than once; &#160; &#160; (3) for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of ordinary stock upon a conversion or upon any conversion or exchange in respect of any other securities or the exercise of any other options, warrants or other rights shall not result in an adjustment to the floor price; and &#160; &#160; (4) at any time when the ordinary stock are not admitted to trading on a recognised stock exchange, the floor price shall be adjusted as provided above save that for the purposes thereof the current market price, the vwap of a unit of ordinary stock and the date upon which any adjustment becomes effective shall be determined in good faith by an independent financial adviser in such manner as it considers appropriate to ensure that an adjustment to the floor price is made which gives the intended same result as if the ordinary stock we so admitted to trading. &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; notice of any adjustments to the floor price pursuant to this condition 4(e)(v) shall be given by the issuer in accordance with condition 13 to holders promptly after the determination thereof. &#160; the floor price shall not in any event be reduced to below the prevailing nominal value of the ordinary stock at the effective date of such adjustment. the issuer shall not take any action, and procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the floor price to an amount below such nominal value. &#160; &#160; (f) events not giving rise to adjustments &#160; notwithstanding the provisions of condition 4(e), no adjustment to the floor price will be made: &#160; &#160; (i) as a result of any issue or distribution of new ordinary stock or other securities if the pre-emptive right in respect thereof has been validly excluded by a non-routine resolution of the general meeting of stockholders unless a pre-emptive right in respect thereof is granted indirectly to the stockholders by a third party with the agreement of the issuer. for the purpose of these conditions, the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights conferred by way of special resolution proposed at each annual general meeting of the issuer shall not constitute a non-routine resolution; or &#160; &#160; (ii) as a result of any public issue of bonds convertible into ordinary stock or bonds with options to subscribe for ordinary stock, such issue being in connection with a conditional increase of the share capital of the issuer, irrespective of whether in respect of such issue the advance subscription rights to acquire such bonds have been excluded or not, unless advance subscription rights have been granted and are traded on the primary stock exchange; or &#160; &#160; (iii) if, as a result of any non-cash dividend by the issuer, the issuer sells any share, right, warrant or other security representing the same (an &#8220; interest &#8221;) in any of its subsidiaries to holders of the ordinary stock at fair value, and for this purpose: &#160; &#160; (1) where such interest is listed on, traded on, or dealt in any stock exchange, the fair value of such interest shall be at least 95 per cent. of the average of the last paid prices therefor on such stock exchange (or, if more than one, the principal such stock exchange) on each of the ten dealing days commencing on the twentieth dealing day before the day on which the issuer officially announces the terms and conditions for such sale, as determined by an independent financial adviser; and &#160; &#160; (2) where such interest is not so listed, traded or dealt in, the fair value of such interest shall be at least 95 per cent. of the fair market value thereof; or &#160; &#160; (iv) if an increase in the floor price would result from such adjustment, except in case of an exchange of the ordinary stock for other securities or a consolidation of ordinary stock. &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; &#160; (g) decision of an independent financial adviser &#160; &#160; (i) if any doubt shall arise as to whether an adjustment falls to be made to the floor price or the conversion price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the floor price, and following consultation between the issuer and an independent financial adviser, a written opinion of such independent financial adviser in respect thereof shall be conclusive and binding on the issuer and the holders, save in the case of manifest error. &#160; &#160; (ii) if the independent financial adviser does not at any time for any reason make any determination or calculate any adjustment in the circumstances provided for in this condition 4 then the holders shall, at the expense of the issuer, be entitled to appoint an agent to do so, and such determination or calculation shall be deemed to have been made by the independent financial adviser. in doing so, the holders&#8217; agent shall apply the foregoing provisions of condition 4, with any necessary consequential amendments, to the extent that, in its opinion, it can do so, and in all other respects it shall do so in such manner as it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. &#160; &#160; (h) share option schemes &#160; no adjustment will be made to the floor price if ordinary stock or other securities (including pre-emptive rights, options or warrants in relation to ordinary stock or other securities) are issued, offered or granted to, or for the benefit of, directors or employees, or former directors or employees, of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person in any such case pursuant to any employee share or option scheme which, if required, has been approved by stockholders. &#160; &#160; (i) rounding down &#160; on any adjustment, the resultant floor price, if a number that is of more decimal places than the initial floor price, shall be rounded to such decimal place. no adjustment shall be made to the floor price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the floor price then in effect. any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the floor price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or, as the case may be, that the relevant rounding down had not been made. &#160; &#160; (j) no other conversion events &#160; other than a conversion in accordance with this condition 4, the ccns are not subject to any other conversion event. in particular, the ccns are not convertible into ordinary stock at the option of the holders. &#160;

&#160; 28 &#160; &#160; &#160; (l) fractions &#160; fractions of ordinary stock will not be issued or delivered pursuant to the conditions upon a conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. &#160; &#160; (m) delivery of ordinary stock &#160; &#160; (i) the issuer shall, on or prior to the conversion settlement date, allot and issue or deliver to the holders such number of units of ordinary stock as is required to satisfy in full the issuer&#8217;s obligation to deliver ordinary stock in respect of the conversion of the aggregate amount of ccns as at the conversion date. receipt by the holders of such ordinary stock and accrued conversion interest (if any) shall be a good and complete discharge of the issuer&#8217;s obligations in respect of the ccns. &#160; &#160; (ii) in order to obtain delivery of the relevant ordinary stock upon a conversion, the relevant holder must deliver the relevant certificates representing the ccns held by it to the specified office of the registrar prior to the conversion settlement date. &#160; &#160; (iii) the issuer shall procure that ordinary stock to be created, issued and delivered following a conversion event will be delivered to the holders in uncertificated form through crest, unless at the relevant time the ordinary stock are not a participating security in crest or the relevant holder elects to receive the ordinary stock in certificated registered form.&#160;&#160;where the ordinary stock are to be delivered through crest, they will be delivered to an account specified by the relevant holder prior to the conversion settlement date. where the ordinary stock are to be delivered in certificated form, a certificate in respect thereof will be dispatched by mail free of charge (but uninsured and at the risk of the recipient) to the relevant holder or prior to the conversion settlement date. &#160; &#160; (n) taxes and duties &#160; &#160; (i) a holder must pay any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes or duties arising on conversion (other than any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes or other duties payable in ireland in respect of the issue and delivery of the ordinary stock delivered pursuant to these conditions which shall be paid by the issuer) and such holder must pay all, if any, taxes arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a ccn or interest therein. &#160; &#160; (ii) if the issuer shall fail to pay any taxes or capital, stamp, issue, registration and transfer taxes or other duties payable in ireland for which it is responsible as provided in condition 4(n)(i) above, any holder shall be entitled (but shall not be obliged) to tender and pay the same and the issuer, as a separate and independent stipulation, covenants to reimburse and indemnify on an after tax basis such holder in respect of any payment thereof and any penalties payable in respect thereof. &#160; &#160; (o) ordinary stock &#160; the ordinary stock issued or delivered on conversion will be fully paid and non-assessable, free from any encumbrance and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid ordinary stock in issue on the conversion settlement date except in &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; any such case for any right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable law, and except that the ordinary stock so issued or delivered will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant holder shall not be entitled to receive) any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the conversion settlement date. &#160; 5. covenants &#160; for so long as any ccn remains outstanding, the issuer shall (in each case save with the prior written approval of the holders): &#160; &#160; (a) not make any issue, grant, reorganisation, capitalisation or distribution or take or omit to take any other action if the effect thereof would be (or is reasonably foreseeable to be) that a unit of ordinary stock cannot be legally issued as fully paid and free from any encumbrance on the conversion of each ccn; &#160; &#160; (b) (other than in connection with a reorganisation or a liability management exercise) not issue or pay up any ordinary stock or other securities, in either case by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, other than: &#160; &#160; (i) by the issue of fully paid ordinary stock or other securities to stockholders and other holders of shares in the capital of the issuer which, by their terms, entitle the holders thereof to receive ordinary stock or other securities on a capitalisation of profits or reserves; or &#160; &#160; (ii) by the issue of ordinary stock paid up in full (in accordance with applicable law) and issued wholly, ignoring fractional entitlements, in lieu of the whole or part of a dividend in cash (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of ordinary stock in respect of hybrid capital instruments where there is an alternative coupon settlement mechanism); or &#160; &#160; (iii) by the issue of fully paid other securities to the holders of ordinary stock or other securities which, by their terms, entitle the holders thereof to receive other securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of ordinary stock in respect of hybrid capital instruments where there is an alternative coupon settlement mechanism) ; or &#160; &#160; (iv) by the issue of ordinary stock or other securities to, or for the benefit of, any employee or former employee, director or executive holding or formerly holding executive office of issuer or any of its subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees or nominees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to an employee, director or executive share or option scheme whether for all employees, directors, or executives or any one or more of them, &#160; unless, in any such case, the same constitutes a dividend or otherwise gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of condition 4(i) relating to roundings and minimum adjustments or the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the floor price and unless, if the floor price would otherwise be reduced to below the prevailing nominal value of the ordinary stock at the effective date of such adjustment, gives rise to an adjustment to the nominal value of the ordinary stock to reflect the floor price so reduced; &#160; &#160; (c) not modify the rights attaching to the ordinary stock with respect to voting, dividends or liquidation but so that nothing in this condition 5(b) shall prevent: &#160; 30 &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#160; (d) procure that no ordinary stock or other securities issued without rights to convert into, or exchange or subscribe for, ordinary stock shall subsequently be granted such rights and that at no time shall there be in issue ordinary stock of differing nominal values unless the same gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of condition 4(i) relating to roundings and minimum adjustments or the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the floor price and that at no time shall there be in issue ordinary stock or other securities of differing nominal values, save where such ordinary stock or other securities have the same economic rights; &#160; &#160; (e) not reduce its issued ordinary share capital, share premium account, capital redemption reserve, or any uncalled liability in respect thereof, or any non-distributable reserves, except where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and results in (or would, but for the provisions of condition 4(i) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments, result in) an adjustment to the floor price or is otherwise taken into account for the purposes of determining whether or not such an adjustment should be made, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, this condition 5(e) shall not operate to restrict the issuer from reducing its preference share capital and share premium amounts in respect of its preference share capital;

&#160; 34 &#160; the ccns are for the time being listed or admitted to trading.&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt, a variation under this condition 9 may include a substitution of the issuer. &#160;

in addition, if and for so long as the ccns are listed on the irish stock exchange or any other recognised stock exchange, notices shall be given in accordance with any requirement of such exchange. &#160; any notice or notification (however expressed) to be given to the issuer by any holder shall be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting a letter by registered post containing the notice and shall be deemed to have been given on the second business day after the date of posting. &#160;
