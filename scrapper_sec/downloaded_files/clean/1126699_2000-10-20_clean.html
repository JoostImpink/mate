subsidiary of ebiz, have entered into an agreement and plan of merger, dated august 7, 2000 (the "merger agreement"), providing for the merger of lmi with and into merger sub (the "merger"), with merger sub constituting the surviving entity. b. section 6.1 (d) of the merger agreement provides that it is a condition to the obligation of ebiz to consummate the merger that "ebiz shall have received an opinion from southwest securities, inc. or similarly qualified firm, as determined by ebiz, to the effect that the merger is fair to its shareholders". c. ebiz has been advised by southwest securities, inc., that it will not issue its opinion that the merger is fair to the ebiz shareholders if the merger is consummated at the conversion ratio upon which the lmi common stock and preferred stock is to be exchanged for ebiz common stock that is stated in the merger agreement. d. in order to address the concerns expressed by southwest securities, inc., the parties to the merger agreement have negotiated a reduction of such conversion ratio from 2.2 shares of ebiz common stock for each share of lmi common stock or preferred stock, as currently stated in the merger agreement, to the conversion ratios set forth in this amendment. the parties to the merger agreement have presented the revised conversion ratios set forth in this amendment to southwest securities, inc., and

converted into and represent the right to receive, and shall be exchangeable for, 1.8 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of ebiz, par value $0.001 per share ("ebiz common stock"). (b) each share of series a preferred stock of lmi (the "lmi series a preferred stock") or series b preferred stock of lmi (the "lmi series b preferred stock"), each par value $0.01 per share (collectively, "lmi preferred stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than those shares for which an election for dissenters' rights has been made as contemplated by section 1.4) shall be converted into the number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of ebiz common stock equal to (i) with respect to the lmi series a preferred stock, the product of (a) 2.0 multiplied by (b) the number of shares of lmi common stock into which each share of lmi series a preferred stock is convertible immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) with respect to the lmi series b preferred stock, the product of (a) 2.0 multiplied by (b) the number of shares of lmi common stock into which each share of lmi series b preferred stock is convertible immediately prior to the effective time. immediately prior to the effective time, all outstanding debentures of lmi issued before march 1, 2000 and a designated portion (as hereinafter defined) of the outstanding principal and interest of each debenture of lmi issued after march 1, 2000 shall be converted automatically into lmi preferred stock in accordance with the terms of such debentures.

("canopy") shall, at the election of canopy and in accordance with the terms of the canopy notes, either be repaid by lmi or be converted into lmi common stock.

(c) other provisions. the restricted stock purchase agreement shall contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the plan as may be determined by the administrator in its sole discretion. in addition, the provisions of restricted stock purchase agreements need not be the same with respect to each purchaser. (d) rights as a shareholder. once the stock purchase right is exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the company. no adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock purchase right is exercised, except as provided in section 13 of the plan. 12. non-transferability of options and stock purchase rights. an option or stock purchase right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the optionee, only by the optionee. 13. adjustments upon changes in capitalization, dissolution, merger, asset sale or change of control. (a) changes in capitalization. subject to any required action by the shareholders of the company, the number of shares of common stock covered by each outstanding option and stock purchase right, and the number of shares of common stock which have been authorized for issuance under the plan but as to which no options or stock purchase rights have yet been granted or which have been returned to the plan upon cancellation or expiration of an option or stock purchase right, as well as the price per share of common stock covered by each such outstanding option or stock purchase right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the common stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock effected without receipt of consideration by the company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." such adjustment shall be made by the board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of common stock subject to an option or stock purchase right. page 10 (b) dissolution or liquidation. in the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the company, to the extent that an option or stock purchase right has not been previously exercised, it will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. the board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any option or stock purchase right shall terminate as of a date fixed by the board and give each optionee the right to exercise his or her option or stock purchase right as to all or any part of the optioned stock, including shares as to which the option or stock purchase right would not otherwise be exercisable. (c) merger or asset sale. subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) hereof, in the event of a merger of the company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company, each outstanding option and stock purchase right shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right shall be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. in the event that the successor corporation does not agree to assume the option or stock purchase right or to substitute an equivalent option or right, the administrator shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the optionee to have the right to exercise the option or stock purchase right as to all or a portion of the optioned stock, including shares as to which it would not otherwise be exercisable. if the administrator makes an option or stock purchase right exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the administrator shall notify the optionee that the option or stock purchase right shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the option or stock purchase right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. for the purposes of this paragraph, the option or stock purchase right shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase, for each share of optioned stock subject to the option or stock purchase right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of common stock for each share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the option or stock purchase right, for each share of optioned stock subject to the option or stock purchase right, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of common stock in the merger or sale of assets.

(f) change in control price. for purposes of this section 13, "change in control price" shall be, as determined by the board, (i) the highest fair market value of a share within the 60 day period immediately preceding the date of determination of the change in control price by the board (the "60-day period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered per share, as determined by the board, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer related to the change in control of the company, at any time within the 60-day period, or (iii) some lower price as the board, in its discretion, determines to be a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of a share. 14. date of grant. the date of grant of an option or stock purchase right shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the administrator makes the determination granting such option or stock purchase right, or such other later date as is determined by the administrator. notice of the determination shall be provided to each optionee within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. page 12 15. amendment and termination of the plan.
