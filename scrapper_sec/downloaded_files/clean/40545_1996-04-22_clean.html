company on november 15, 1990, an action under the federal false claims act 31 u.s.c. section 3729-32, was filed under seal against general electric company ("ge") in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio. the qui tam action, brought by an organization called taxpayers against fraud and an employee of ge's aircraft engines division ("geae"), alleged that geae, in connection with its sales of f11o aircraft engines and support equipment to israel, made false statements to the israeli ministry of defense (mod), causing mod to submit false claims to the united states department of defense under the foreign military sales program. senior ge management became aware of possible misconduct in geae's israeli f110 program in december 1990. before learning of the sealed qui tam suit, ge immediately made a voluntary disclosure to the departments of defense and justice, promised full cooperation and restitution, and began an internal investigation. in august 1991, the federal court action was unsealed, and the department of justice intervened and took over responsibility for the case. on july 22, 1992, after ge had completed its investigation and made a complete factual disclosure to the u.s. government as part of settlement discussions, the united states and ge executed a settlement agreement and filed a stipulation dismissing the civil action. without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ge agreed to pay $59.5 million in full settlement of the civil fraud claims. also on july 22, 1992, in connection with the same matter, the united states filed a four count information charging ge with violations of 18 u.s.c. section 287 (submitting false claims against the united states), 18 u.s.c. section 1957 (engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property), 15 u.s.c. sections 78m(b)(2)(a) and 78ff(a) (inaccurate books and records), and 18 u.s.c. section 371 (conspiracy to defraud the united states and to commit offenses against the united states). the same day, ge and the united states entered a plea agreement in which ge agreed to waive indictment, plead guilty to the information, and pay a fine of $9.5 million. ge was that day sentenced by the federal court in accordance with the plea agreement. 2. except for the foregoing, ge has not and, to the best of ge's knowledge, none of the directors and executive officers of ge has been, during the last five years, convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors). 3. ge has not and, to the best of ge's knowledge, none of the directors and executive officers of ge has been, during the last five years, a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. ex-99.1 2 exhibit 99.1 loan and security agreement this loan and security agreement (the "agreement") dated as of may 19, 1992, is by and between

that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto (the "maximum lawful rate"), then, in such event, and so long as the amount payable under the maximum lawful rate would be so exceeded, the amount of interest payable hereunder shall be equal to the amount payable under the maximum lawful rate. thereafter, the amount of interest payable hereunder shall be the amount determined in accordance with the terms hereof unless and until the amount so calculated again exceeds the amount payable under the maximum lawful rate, in which event this paragraph shall again apply. in no event shall the total interest received by lender pursuant to the terms hereof exceed the amount which lender could lawfully have received had the interest due

notwithstanding the provisions of this section 2.7, shall make a final determination that lender has received interest hereunder or under any other agreements in excess of the amount payable under the maximum lawful rate, lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, promptly apply such excess in the following order: (i) to the then due and payable fees and expenses; (ii) to the then due

($100,000) or an integral multiple thereof. partial prepayments of the nonrevolving credit note shall be applied on account of the installments of principal thereof in the inverse order of the normal maturity thereof, except as otherwise provided in this agreement. all prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment. prepayments

that borrower has paid the commitment fee to lender's agent. 2.11 application of payments and collections. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any default or event of default, borrower

advances, to approve or disapprove requests to take action prohibited hereunder and other requests or approvals required by lender hereunder. thus, any requests, approvals, disapprovals, notices or other communications received by borrower in connection with this agreement or the loan documents from lender's agent as lender's agent-in-fact shall be treated by borrower as if such notices and communications were received from lender directly. all action taken by lender's agent on behalf of lender shall be subject to the terms of this agreement. borrower's obligations to lender's agent hereunder shall be for the express benefit of lender. failure of borrower to perform any obligation hereunder to lender's agent shall be construed as a default or event of default hereunder, as the case may be, and the failure of lender's agent to perform any obligation hereunder on behalf of lender in accordance with the terms of this agreement shall be a breach by lender. 3. loan disbursements

equal the product of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share of common stock one business day following payment of any such dividend or distribution, and (b) the denominator of which shall be (x) such current market price per share of common stock, minus (y) the fair value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company and supported by an opinion from an investment banking firm of recognized national standing acceptable to the majority holders) of any and all such cash, evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock, other securities or property divided by the shares of common stock outstanding one business day following payment of any such dividend or distribution, and (ii) the current warrant price shall be adjusted to equal (a) the current warrant price multiplied by the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the adjustment divided by (b) the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable immediately after such adjustment. any increased number of shares of common stock subject to this warrant resulting from application of the foregoing shall be allocated ratably among all shares of common stock subject to this warrant prior to each such event and the shares (including the newly allocated shares) not subject to clause (i) of section 2.1 shall remain subject to the conditions precedent to exercise described in clause (ii)

(b) the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 4.3 shall not apply to any issuance of additional shares of common stock for which an adjustment is provided under section 4.1 or 4.2. no adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant shall be exercisable or the purchase price therefor shall be made under paragraph (a) of section 4.3 upon the issuance of any additional shares of common stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights or pursuant to the exercise of any conversion or exchange rights in any

this warrant is exercisable automatically shall be increased in an amount equal to 11.1% of the additional shares of common stock underlying such warrants, other rights or convertible securities and the purchase price for (only) such additional shares of common stock shall be an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price for such warrants or other rights and their underlying additional shares of common stock and such convertible securities (including their underlying shares of common stock), if any, on the basis that (i) the maximum number of additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to all such warrants or other rights or necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding, (ii) the price per share of such additional shares of common stock shall be deemed to be the lowest possible price per share in any range of prices per share at which such additional shares of common stock are available to such holders, and (iii) the company shall be deemed to have received all of the consideration payable for such warrants, rights and underlying additional shares of common stock and convertible securities (including their underlying shares of common stock), if any, as of the date of the actual issuance of such warrants or other rights. no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable or the price therefor shall be made upon the actual issue of such underlying common stock or of such underlying convertible securities upon exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon the actual issue of such underlying common stock upon such conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. 4.5 issuance of convertible securities. if at any time the company shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell, any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, then the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable automatically shall be increased in an amount equal to 11.1% of the additional shares of common stock into which such convertible securities may be converted or exchanged and the purchase price for (only) such additional shares of common stock shall be an amount equal to the consideration paid for such convertible securities plus the conversion or exchange price for such underlying additional shares of common stock on the basis that (i) the maximum number of additional shares of common stock necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding, (ii) the price per share of such additional shares of common stock shall be deemed to be the lowest possible price per share in any range of prices per share at which such additional shares of common stock are available to such holders, and (iii) the company shall be deemed to have received all of the consideration payable for such convertible securities and additional shares of common stock, if any, as of

4.5 upon the issuance of any convertible securities which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights therefor, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights pursuant to section 4.4. no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable or the price therefor shall be made upon the actual issue of such underlying common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. 4.6 superseding adjustment. if, at any time after any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall have been made pursuant to section 4.4 or section 4.5 as the result of any issuance of warrants, rights or convertible securities, (a) such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange in such other convertible securities, shall expire, and all or a portion of such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange with respect to all or a portion of such other convertible securities, as the case may be, shall not have been exercised, or (b) the consideration per share for which shares of common stock are issuable pursuant to such warrants or rights, or the terms of such other convertible securities, shall be increased solely by virtue of provisions therein contained for an automatic increase in such consideration per share upon the occurrence of a specified date or event, then such previous adjustment shall be rescinded and annulled and the additional shares of common stock which were deemed to have been issued by virtue of the computation made in connection with the adjustment so rescinded and annulled shall no longer be deemed to have been issued by virtue of such computation. thereupon, a recomputation shall be made of the effect of such rights or options or other convertible securities on then outstanding warrants, but not on any then outstanding warrant stock, on the basis of (c) treating the number of additional shares of common stock or other property, if any, theretofore actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of any such warrants or rights or any such right of conversion or exchange, as having been issued on the date or dates of any such exercise and for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor, and (d) treating any such warrants or rights or any such other convertible securities which then remain outstanding as having been granted or issued immediately after the time of such increase of the consideration per share for which shares of common stock or other property are issuable under such warrants or rights or other convertible securities. 4.7 other provisions applicable to adjustments

(c) deferral of issuance of warrant stock. if after any cash or property of any type or kind, including evidences of indebtedness, becomes distributable pursuant to this section 4 by reason of the taking of any record of the holders of common stock, but prior to the occurrence of the event for which such record is taken, holder exercises this warrant, then the company may elect to defer the issuance of common stock to holder resulting from the occurrence of such event until such event actually takes place; provided that the company shall deliver to holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing holder's right to receive such common stock upon the occurrence of any such event. notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, if the event for which such record was taken fails to occur or is rescinded, then such due bill shall be deemed cancelled and such right to receive such additional shares shall terminate. 4.8 reorganization, reclassification, merger,

warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed appropriate (as determined by resolution of the

warrant is exercisable and/or the purchase price thereof shall be adjusted in such manner as may be required hereunder or equitable in the circumstances. 4.10 certain limitations. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any adjustment hereunder would cause the current warrant price to be less than the par value per share of common stock, then the current warrant price shall equal such par value. 5. notices to warrant holders 5.1 notice of adjustments. whenever the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable, or whenever the price at which a share of

officer of the company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated, specifying the number of shares of common stock

ge medical from and against any and all losses related to, caused by or arising from any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to fulfill any covenant or agreement of maxum contained

shall be exercised by the giving of notice by the indemnifying party to each indemnified party within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice. any claim for indemnification which is not protested by the 30th day following receipt of notice thereof shall be deemed valid and shall be due and payable in full on the 31st day following such receipt. article 13 termination 13.1 termination. this agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the merger, and the transactions related thereto: (a) by mutual consent of ge medical and the insight parties; (b) by either ge medical or the insight parties if the merger shall not have been consummated on or before september 30, 1996 despite the good faith effort of such party to effect such consummation (unless the failure to so consummate the merger by such date shall be due to the breach of this agreement or the merger agreement by the party seeking to terminate this agreement); (c) by ge medical if (i)(a) there are inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any of the insight parties that would have a material adverse effect on any of the insight parties, (b) there has been a material breach on the
