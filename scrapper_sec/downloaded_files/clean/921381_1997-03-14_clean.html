("fs"), ff- southland, l.p. ("ffs"), f-jotan, l.l.c. ("fj"), ralph and david freedman ("freedman") entered into a preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement (the "preferred stock agreement"), pursuant to which rice purchased 40,000 shares of the issuer's series b redeemable preferred stock ("series b preferred stock") for a purchase price of $8 million and was issued warrants (the "rice warrants") to acquire 12,096,929 shares of common stock of the issuer, fs purchased 5,000 shares of the series b preferred stock for a purchase price of $1 million and was issued warrants (the "fs warrants") to acquire 1,557,031 shares of common stock of the issuer and ffs purchased 5,000 shares of the series b preferred stock for a purchase price of $1 million and was issued warrants (the "ffs warrants") to acquire 1,557,031 shares of common stock of the issuer. the rice warrants, the fs warrants and the ffs warrants are together referred to herein as the "warrants." the preferred stock agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 1. the designation of rights of the series b preferred stock set forth in articles of amendment to the issuer's articles of incorporation, which are attached hereto as exhibit 3, provides, among other things, that the holders of the series b preferred stock have the right to elect a majority of the members of the issuer's board of directors. this right is exercisable by action of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of series b preferred stock. also on march 4, 1997, the issuer, rice, fs and ffs entered into a note purchase agreement (the "note purchase agreement") pursuant to which rice purchased senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of $7 million, fs purchased senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1 million and ffs purchased senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1 million. the warrants provide that the aggregate exercise price for all of the common stock issuable thereunder will not exceed $200 as to any of rice, fs or ffs, and that the warrants will be exercisable until february 28, 2007. the warrants are immediately exercisable. rice currently intends to hold the rice warrants for investment purposes and has no immediate intention to exercise the rice warrants. in connection with the above described transactions, rice, the issuer, fs, ffs, fj, ralph and freedman entered into a shareholder agreement (the "shareholder agreement") providing, among other things, that each of rice, fs, ffs, fj, ralph and freedman agreed to vote all shares of capital stock of the issuer owned by them such that a majority of the board of directors of the issuer will consist of persons nominated by rice, so long as rice owns, directly or indirectly, capital stock of the issuer that is equal to or greater than 10% of rice's original equity investment in respect of the total capital stock of the issuer (subject to certain adjustments), and if rice owns less than 10% of rice's original equity investment in respect of the total capital stock of the issuer, to elect one person nominated by rice to serve as a director of the issuer so long as rice owns any equity interest in the issuer. the shareholder agreement similarly requires all of the named persons to vote all shares of capital stock of the issuer owned by them for the election of one person designated by fs and ffs to serve as a director of the issuer. the shareholder agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 2. pursuant to the rights described above, as of the closing of the preferred stock agreement and the note purchase agreement, the size of the board of directors was set at five, and three persons designated by rice, philip a. davidson, jeffrey p. sangalis and james p. wilson were elected to serve as directors of the issuer. the remaining two directors are jeremiah m. callahan, an individual affiliated with fs, ffs and fj, and ralph, both of whom were serving as directors at the time of closing. the above transactions facilitated the completion by the issuer of a $12 million senior revolving credit facility and $27 million in senior term/acquisition facilities (the "senior credit facilities"). a portion of these funds, together with funds received pursuant to the note purchase agreement and the preferred stock agreement, were applied at closing to consummate the purchase by the issuer of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of southland holding company ("shc"), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $27.5 million, and the payment to the selling shareholders of non- competition payments in the amount of approximately $6.5 million (the "southland acquisition"). rice is engaged in the principal business of acquiring and holding securities for investment purposes. the above transactions were entered into by rice for investment purposes in order to facilitate the financing of the southland acquisition and to provide the issuer with sufficient capital to pursue additional possible acquisitions in the future. the described transactions have provided rice with control of the issuer by virtue of its right to acquire, upon exercise of the rice warrants, a majority of the outstanding common stock of the issuer and its right to designate, as described above, persons to serve as a majority of the board of directors of the issuer. except as described above, rice has no plans or proposals to: (a) acquire additional securities of the issuer or to dispose of any securities of the issuer; (b) enter into, or cause the issuer or any of its subsidiaries to enter into, any extraordinary corporate transactions, other than that the issuer plans to seek other acquisition opportunities as a means of expanding its business; (c) enter into or cause the issuer or any of its subsidiaries to sell or transfer a material amount of its assets; (d) change the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, except as described above and except that (1) the issuer may seek to hire a new chief executive officer and (2) the issuer may seek to add an independent director to the board of directors, in which event rice may exercise its right to designate an additional director; (e) change the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) make any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure; (g) make any change in the issuer's charter or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h) cause a class of securities of the issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) cause a class of equity securities of the issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934; or (j) any action similar to those described above. ralph: ralph has joined in this filing by virtue of his execution of the shareholder agreement, which has resulted in his being deemed a member of the "group" consisting of rice, fs, ffs and fj that has resulted from the purchase of the warrants pursuant to the preferred stock agreement and the agreement contained in the shareholder agreement that the parties thereto will vote for the election of directors of the issuer as described above. ralph agreed to execute and deliver the preferred stock purchase agreement and the shareholder agreement to facilitate the investments in the issuer made by rice, fs and ffs and the other transactions described above. except as described above, ralph has no plans or proposals to: (a) acquire additional securities of the issuer or to dispose of any securities of the issuer; (b) enter into, or cause the issuer or any of its subsidiaries to enter into, any extraordinary corporate transactions, other than that the issuer plans to seek other acquisition opportunities as a means of expanding its business; (c) enter into or cause the issuer or any of its subsidiaries to sell or transfer a material amount of its assets; (d) change the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) change the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) make any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate structure; (g) make any change in the issuer's charter or bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h) cause a class of securities of the issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) cause a class of equity securities of the issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934; or (j) any action similar to those described above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer as to rice and ralph: rice, ralph, fs, ffs and fj may be deemed to be members of a "group" as a result of the purchase of the warrants pursuant to the preferred stock agreement and the agreement contained in the shareholder agreement that the parties thereto will vote for the election of directors of the issuer as described above. the other party to those agreements, freedman, is not included as a member of such group, or as a reporting person, because he does not at this time own beneficially any voting securities of the issuer, but does hold certain incentive stock options that may become exercisable in the future. each of rice, ralph, fs, ffs and fj disclaims beneficial ownership of the warrants and all other securities of the issuer owned by each of the others, and also disclaims status as a "group" upon any basis, or for any purpose, other than their being parties to the preferred stock agreement and the shareholder agreement as described above. the following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of the common stock that would be issued to rice, fs and ffs assuming the immediate exercise of the warrants, that is owned by ralph, and that would be issuable to fj upon conversion of its shares of series a convertible preferred stock of the issuer. rice partners ii,

(e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. as to rice and ralph: see item 4 above. the preferred stock agreement

if approved by majority vote of the issuer's shareholders other than rice, fs, ffs and fj, provided that such special voting rights will not apply to (a) transactions in which the issuer sells all or part of its capital stock, (b) transactions in which rice, fs, ffs or fj sell any of their capital stock of the issuer, or (c) any other transaction entered into by rice, fs, ffs or fj. the

issuer of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, (ii) require that the holders of the warrants be paid a dilution fee to the extent that dividends are paid on common stock of the

or (b) consideration (including cash) by way of spin-off, split-up, reclassification (including any reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is the surviving corporation), recapitalization, combination of shares into a smaller number of shares, or similar corporate restructuring; other than additional shares of common stock issued as a stock dividend or in a stock-split (adjustments in respect of which are provided for in sections 2.08(a)(ii) and (iii)), then, and in each -------------------- ----- such case, the holders, on the exercise of warrants, will be entitled to receive for each share of common stock issuable under the warrants as of the record date fixed for such distribution, the greatest per share amount of consideration received by any holder of any class of common stock or common stock equivalent or to which such holder is entitled less the amount of any dilution fee actually and irrevocably paid to such holders. all such consideration receivable upon exercise of such warrant with respect to such a distribution will be deemed to be outstanding and owned by such holder for preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement - page 15 - ---------------------------------------------- purposes of determining the amount of consideration to which such holder is entitled upon exercise of the warrant with respect to any subsequent distribution. (ii) if at any time there occurs any stock split, stock dividend or distribution, reverse stock split, or other subdivision of the common stock, then the number of shares of common stock to be received by the holder of the warrant and the exercise price, subject to the limitations set forth in this agreement, will be proportionately adjusted. (iii) in case of any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of any class of common stock or common stock equivalent (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or in the case of any consolidation of the company with, or merger or share exchange of the company with or into, another person, or in case of any sale of all or a majority of the property, assets, business, income or revenue generating capacity, or goodwill of the company, the company, or such successor or other person, as the case may be, will provide that the holder of this warrant will thereafter be entitled to receive the highest per share kind and amount of consideration received or receivable (including cash) upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, share exchange, or sale by any holder of any class of common stock or common stock equivalent that this warrant entitles the holder to receive immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, share exchange, or sale (as adjusted pursuant to section ------- 2.08(a)(i) and otherwise in this agreement). any such successor ---------- person, which thereafter will be deemed to be the company for purposes of the warrants, will provide for adjustments that are as nearly equivalent as may be possible to the adjustments provided for by this section 2.08. ------------ (iv) if at any time the company issues or sells any shares of any common stock or any common stock equivalent at a per unit or share consideration (which consideration will include the price paid upon issuance plus the minimum amount of any exercise, conversion, or similar payment made upon exercise or conversion of any common stock equivalent) less than the exercise price or the then current fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to the time such common stock or common stock equivalent is issued or sold (the "additional securities"), then: ---------------------- (a) the exercise price will be reduced (but not increased) to the lower of the prices calculated by: (i) dividing (x) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately prior to such issuance or sale multiplied by the then existing exercise price plus (2) the aggregate consideration, if any, received by the company preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement - page 16 - ---------------------------------------------- upon such issuance or sale, by (y) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale on a fully diluted basis; and (ii) multiplying the then existing exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately prior to such issuance or sale, multiplied by the fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to such issuance or sale, plus (2) the aggregate consideration received by the company upon such issuance or sale, (y) divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after such issuance or sale, and the denominator of which is the fair market value per share of common stock immediately prior to such issuance or sale (for purposes of this subsection (ii), the date as of which the fair market --------------- value per share of common stock will be computed will be the earlier of the date upon which the company will (aa) enters into a firm contract for the issuance of such shares, or (bb) issues such shares); and (b) the number of shares of common stock for which any of the warrants may be exercised at the exercise price resulting from the adjustment described in subsection (a) above will be -------------- equal to the product of the number of shares of common stock purchasable under such warrants immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. (v) in case any event occurs as to which the preceding sections -------- 2.08(a)(i) through (iv) are not strictly applicable, but as to which ---------- ---- the failure to make any adjustment would not fairly protect the purchase rights represented by the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of this agreement, then, in each such case, the holders may appoint an independent investment bank or firm of independent public accountants, which will give its opinion as to the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in this agreement, necessary to preserve the purchase rights represented by the warrants. upon receipt of such opinion, the company will promptly deliver a copy of such opinion to the holders and will make the adjustments described in such opinion. the fees and expenses of such investment bank or independent public accountants will be borne equally by the holders and the company. preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement - page 17 - ---------------------------------------------- (b) the company and the shareholder will not by any action including, without limitation, amending, or permitting the amendment of, the charter documents, bylaws, or similar instruments of the company or through any reorganization, reclassification, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, share exchange, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other similar voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this agreement or the warrants, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the holders against impairment or dilution. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the company and the shareholder will (i) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock and other securities, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities, and claims and (ii) use its best efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions, or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction as may be necessary to enable the company to perform its obligations under the warrants. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company represents and warrants that the board of directors of the company has determined the exercise price to be adequate and the issuance of the warrants to be in the best interests of the company. (c) any calculation under this section 2.08 will be made to the ------------ nearest one ten-thousandth of a share and the number of issuable warrant shares resulting from such calculation will be rounded up to the next whole share of common stock or other securities comprising issuable warrant shares. (d) the company will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to, issue any capital stock other than common stock and common stock equivalents. 2.09 lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed instruments. if any of the ------------------------------------------------- warrants or certificates for preferred shares are lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed and if the company receives a lost security affidavit containing an indemnification from the holder of such warrant or preferred shares and containing such other terms and providing for such bonding as may be reasonably requested by the company, the company will issue a new warrant or certificate for preferred shares, as the case may be, of like denomination, tenor, and date as the warrant or certificate for preferred shares, as the case may be, so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. any such new warrant or certificate for preferred shares, as the case may be, will constitute an original obligation of the company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed warrant or certificate for preferred shares, as the case may be, is at any time enforceable by any person. 2.10 stock legend. without limiting the provisions of section 2.02 hereof, ------------ the warrants, the warrant shares and the preferred shares have not been registered under the securities act or qualified under applicable state securities laws. accordingly, unless there is an effective registration statement and qualification respecting the warrants, the warrant shares or the preferred shares, as the case may be, under the securities act or under applicable state preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement - page 18 - ---------------------------------------------- securities laws, the preferred shares and, at the time of exercise of a warrant, any stock certificate issued pursuant to the exercise of a warrant will bear the following legend: "the shares represented by this certificate (a) have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws, and may not be pledged, sold, offered for sale, transferred, or otherwise disposed of in the absence of registration under or exemption from such act and all applicable state securities laws, including, without limitation, the north carolina securities act, as amended, the texas securities act of 1957, as amended, and the georgia securities act of 1973, as amended, and (b) are subject to the terms of and provisions of a preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement and a shareholder agreement, each dated as of february 28, 1997 among jotan, inc.

(e) in the case of any options that expire by their terms not more than 30 days after the date of issue thereof, no adjustment of the series a conversion price shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such options, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the same manner provided in clause (c) above; and (f) if any such record date shall have been fixed and such options or convertible securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the series a conversion price that became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and shall instead be made on the actual date of issuance, if any.

(v) determination of consideration. for purposes of this ------------------------------ paragraph a.5(e) of this section 4.2, the consideration received by the corporation for the issue of any additional shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) cash and property. such consideration shall: ----------------- (1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the corporation (before commissions or expenses) excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends; (2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors; and exhibit a to articles of amendment of restated - ---------------------------------------------- articles of incorporation of jotan - page 9 - ---------------------------------- (3) in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration that covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the board of directors; and (b) options and convertible securities. the consideration ---------------------------------- per share received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to paragraph a.5(e)(iii) of this section 4.2 relating to options and convertible securities shall be determined by dividing: (1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the corporation as consideration for the issue of such options or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities by (2) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (f) other distributions. in the event the corporation shall at any ------------------- time or from time to time make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, other than additional shares of common stock, then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of series a convertible preferred stock shall receive, upon the conversion thereof, the securities of the corporation that they would have received had their stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such event. (g) adjustments. in case of any reorganization or any ----------- reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation, any consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another entity or entities or the conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of exhibit a to articles of amendment of restated - ---------------------------------------------- articles of incorporation of jotan - page 10 - ---------------------------------- the corporation, each share of series a convertible preferred stock (other than shares of series a convertible preferred stock for which the holder thereof has elected to receive the series a preferential amount pursuant to paragraph a.3 above) shall thereafter be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of such share of series a convertible preferred stock would have been entitled upon the record date of (or date of, if no record date is fixed) such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or conveyance; and, in any case, appropriate adjustment (as reasonably determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series a convertible preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as equivalent as is practicable, in relation to any shares of stock or the securities or property (including cash) thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the shares of such series a convertible preferred stock. (h) certificates as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each ------------------------------ adjustment or readjustment of the series a conversion price pursuant to this paragraph a.5 of this section 4.2, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of series a convertible preferred stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of series a convertible preferred stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the series a conversion price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of series a convertible preferred stock.
