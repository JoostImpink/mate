in item 4 below, as of august 4, 1997, each of roy a. wright, donald w. iwerks, dag tellefsen, meriken nominees limited, william j. battison iii and bruce c. hinckley (collectively, the "supporting stockholders") has entered into separate stockholder support agreements (collectively, the "stockholder support agreements") with showscan entertainment inc., a delaware corporation ("showscan"). the supporting stockholders have entered into the stockholder support agreements in order to induce showscan to enter into that certain agreement and plan of reorganization dated august 4, 1997 (the "merger agreement"), by and among showscan, iwerks and iwk-1 merger corporation, a delaware corporation ("merger sub"). item 4. purpose of transaction. on august 4, 1997, iwerks, merger sub and showscan entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger (the "merger") of merger sub with and into showscan, whereupon the separate existence of merger sub will cease and showscan will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of iwerks. at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), (a) each share of common stock of showscan which is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares then owned by showscan or any of its subsidiaries and shares of common stock then held by iwerks or any of its subsidiaries) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.85 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of iwerks (the "iwerks common stock") and (b) each share of showscan's series c convertible preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the "preferred stock") which is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares then owned by showscan or any of its subsidiaries, shares of preferred stock then held by iwerks or any of its subsidiaries and shares of preferred stock as to which appraisal rights have been perfected, and not withdrawn or lost, under the delaware general corporation law) will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of iwerks common stock as is equal to the number of shares of showscan's common stock into which such share of preferred stock is convertible immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.85. at the effective time, each outstanding share of capital stock of merger sub shall be converted into and become one share of the surviving corporation's common stock. stockholders of showscan otherwise entitled to fractional shares of iwerks common stock shall be paid cash in lieu of fractional shares. in addition, at the effective time, each outstanding warrant, option, purchase right, subscription or other right or agreement or commitment of any character relating to the issuance of shares of showscan's common stock, preferred stock, or any other shares of capital stock of showscan (including, without limitation, warrants, options or rights that may be issued and outstanding under any stock option plan but excluding showscan's 8% convertible notes due september 1, 1999 (the "8% notes"), preferred stock and the rights set forth in the rights agreement by and between showscan and continental stock transfer & trust company dated as of november 11, 1994, as amended (collectively, the "showscan purchase rights"), whether vested or unvested, shall, subject to the terms of any applicable stock option, warrant agreement or other applicable agreement evidencing the same, remain outstanding following the effective time. at the effective time, the showscan purchase rights shall be assumed by iwerks in such manner that iwerks (i) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424 applied" within the meaning of section 424(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code") or (ii) to the extent section 424 of the code does not apply to any showscan purchase rights, would be such a corporation were section 424 applicable to such option. in addition, each 8% note outstanding prior to the effective time shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, during the period such 8% note shall be convertible, upon conversion of such 8% note, in lieu of each share of showscan's common stock deliverable on such conversion immediately prior to the merger, such number of shares of iwerks common stock which are receivable upon the effectiveness of the merger by a holder of one share of showscan's common stock. the obligations of the parties to the merger agreement to effect the merger are subject to certain conditions, and prior to the effective time, iwerks or showscan may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, in each case as set forth in the merger agreement. because approval by iwerks' stockholders is required in order to issue iwerks common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, iwerks will submit such issuance to its stockholders for approval. concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the supporting stockholders have entered into the stockholder support agreements. pursuant to the stockholder support agreements, the supporting stockholders have agreed to vote all of their voting securities, currently representing (excluding currently exercisable options) an aggregate of 1,619,001 shares of iwerks' common stock (or 13.3% of the outstanding common stock) in favor of the issuance of iwerks common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and, in connection therewith, have granted an irrevocable proxy to dennis pope and w. tucker lemon to do the same in their place and stead. each stockholder support agreement terminates upon any termination of the merger agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or in the event that the board of directors of iwerks shall withdraw or modify in any manner materially adverse to showscan its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger. subject to the terms and conditions of the stockholder support agreements, the supporting stockholders (except for donald w. iwerks with respect to 100,000 shares of iwerks common stock) have agreed, from and after the date of such stockholder support agreements until the earlier of any termination of the stockholder support agreements or the effective time, that they will not, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of their respective voting securities, (b) deposit any of their respective voting securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of their respective voting securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto which is inconsistent with the stockholder support agreements or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any iwerks common stock. if the merger is completed as planned, at the effective time, the directors of merger sub immediately prior to the effective time shall become the directors, and the officers of showscan immediately prior to the effective time shall become the officers, of the surviving corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed. the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of showscan in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement and the stockholder support agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements. the merger agreement is filed as exhibit 1 hereto, and the stockholder support agreements are filed as exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 hereto, and are incorporated herein by reference. other than as described above, none of the

(e) no liability. none of parent, the company, the exchange agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of company common stock and/or company preferred stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

notwithstanding approval thereof by the stockholders of the company or parent: (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of directors of parent and the company; or (b) by either parent or the company, if the merger shall not have been consummated by december 31, 1997 (provided that the right to terminate this agreement under this section 10.1 shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this agreement has been the cause of or a substantial contributor to the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date); or page 40 (c) by either parent or the company, if a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other action having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger (provided that (i) if the party seeking to terminate this agreement pursuant to section 10.1 is subject to such order, decrees or ruling, it shall have used all reasonable efforts to have such order, decree or ruling removed and (ii) the right to terminate this agreement under

determines in good faith, after advice of outside counsel, that such action is necessary in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties to stockholders imposed by law, and if (b) such board of directors is then in receipt of a written opinion from its financial advisor that such alternative proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this agreement; provided, however, prior to any such termination, the company notifies parent promptly of its intention to terminate this agreement or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative proposal, but in no event shall such notice be given less than 48 hours prior to the public announcement of such action; or (ii) if the board of directors of parent shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to the company its approval of this agreement or the merger or recommendation of the issuance of the parent common stock pursuant to the terms of this agreement or the merger. (e) by action of the board of directors of parent if the board of directors of the company shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to parent its approval or recommendation of this agreement or the merger. (f) by parent or the company, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of the company (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the merger, this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of company common stock and company preferred stock (voting as a single class) shall not have approved the merger and this agreement; (g) by parent or the company, if, at a duly held meeting of the stockholders of parent (including any adjournment thereof) held for the purpose of voting on the issuance of the parent common stock in connection with the merger, the requisite vote of a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of parent common stock shall not have approved such issuance. 10.2 option to purchase. (a) the company hereby grants to parent an irrevocable option (the "option") to purchase for an amount equal to $4.14 per share (the "per share price") in cash up page 41 to 330,714 authorized but unissued shares of company common stock (the "optioned shares"). the option shall expire (such event being referred to herein as the "option termination event") if not exercised as permitted under this agreement prior to the earlier of (i) the effective time, (ii) termination of this agreement in accordance with the provisions of section 10.1(a), 10.1(b), 10.1(c), 10.1(d)(ii), 10.1(f) (unless prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced) or 10.1(g) or (iii) the first business day after the three hundred and sixty-fifth calendar day following termination of this agreement for any reason pursuant to 10.1(d)(i), 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) (if prior to the date of the meeting referred to therein an alternative proposal is publicly announced); provided, however, that in the event that the exercise of the option shall be subject to any injunction prohibiting its exercise such period shall be extended for a period of sixty days following the removal of any such injunction. (b) provided that (i) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in the united states prohibiting the exercise of the option or the delivery of the optioned shares shall be in effect and (ii) any such exercise shall otherwise be subject to compliance with applicable law, parent may exercise the option in whole or in part at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of both an initial triggering event and a purchase event (as defined in section 10.2(d)) if, but only if, both the initial triggering event and the purchase event shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an option termination event. in the event that parent wishes to exercise the option, parent shall give written notice of such exercise (the date of such notice being herein called the "notice date") within 30 days following such purchase event to the company specifying the number of optioned shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and a place and date for the closing of such purchase. (c) at any closing of the exercise of the option, (i) parent will make payment to the company of the aggregate price for the optioned shares in immediately available funds, in an amount equal to the product of the per share price multiplied by the number of optioned shares being purchased at such closing and (ii) the company will deliver to parent a duly executed certificate or certificates representing the number of optioned shares so purchased, registered in the name of parent or its nominee in the denominations designated by parent in its notice of exercise. (d) for the purposes this section 10.2, an "initial triggering event" shall have occurred at such time as one of the following events shall have occurred and parent shall have determined in good faith (and shall have notified the company in writing of such determination) that there is a reasonable likelihood that, as a result of the occurrence of any of the following events, consummation of the merger pursuant to the term of this agreement is jeopardized: (i) any person as defined in sections (a)(9) or 13(d)(3) of the exchange act (other than parent or any subsidiary of parent) shall have commenced a bona fide offer to purchase shares of company common stock such that, upon consummation of said offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the outstanding shares of company common stock, or shall have entered into an agreement to (a) merge or consolidate or enter into any similar transaction, with the company, or (b) purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of the company; (ii) any person (other than parent or any subsidiary page 42 of parent) shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the company common stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this section 10.2(d) having the meaning assigned thereto in section 13(d) of the exchange act); (iii) any person (other than parent or any subsidiary of parent) shall have made a bona fide proposal to the company after the date of this agreement by public announcement or written communication to (a) acquire the company by merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar transaction, or (b) make an offer described herein; (iv) any person shall have solicited proxies in a proxy solicitation subject to regulation 14a under the exchange act in opposition to approval of this agreement by the company's stockholders; (v) or any person shall have willfully breached any provision of this agreement, which breach would entitle parent to terminate this agreement and such breach shall not have been cured pursuant to the terms of this agreement and prior to parent's request under this section 10.2. for purposes of this section 10.2, a "purchase event" shall have occurred at such time as the company is obligated to pay to parent the company termination fee set forth in section 10.3(a)(i). (e) at any time commencing upon the occurrence of a purchase event at parent's or company's request, the company shall pay to parent an amount equal to the difference between the "market/tender offer" price for shares of company common stock (defined as the higher of the average price per share at which a tender or exchange offer has been made or the highest reported sale price for shares of company common stock on the date parent or the company gives notice of the required payment under this section 10.2) and the per share price, as adjusted pursuant to section 10.2(f) which difference shall be multiplied by the total number of optioned shares as to which the option has not theretofore been exercised, as adjusted pursuant to section 10.2(f), but only if the market/tender offer price is greater than such exercise price. in the event that the company makes a payment directly to parent of the amounts provided for in this section 10.2(e), such payment shall extinguish all other rights of parent under this option but shall not affect the rights of parent under the agreement or otherwise. (f) if between the date of this agreement and the effective time, the shares of the company common stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the number of optioned shares and the per share price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore parent to its rights hereunder, at an adjusted per share purchase price equal to the per share price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of the company common stock purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of company common stock purchasable after the adjustment; provided, however, that nothing in this option shall be construed as permitting the company to take any action or enter into any transaction prohibited by this agreement. (g) the company shall, if requested by parent, as expeditiously as possible file a registration statement on a form of general use under the securities act if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of company common stock that have been acquired upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition requested by parent. parent shall provide all information page 43 reasonably requested by the company for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. the company will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of two hundred and seventy calendar days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. the registration effected under this section 10.2 shall be at the company's expense except for all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such securities, which amounts shall be borne by parent. in no event shall the company be required to effect more than one registration hereunder regardless of the number of assignees. the filing of any registration statement hereunder may be delayed for such period of time as may reasonably be required if the company determines that any such filing or the offering of any such shares of company common stock would (i) impede, delay or otherwise interfere with any financing, offer or sale of company common stock or any other securities of the company, or (ii) require disclosure of material information which, if disclosed at that time, would be materially harmful to the interests of the company and its shareholders. if requested by parent in connection with any such registration, the company will become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements. upon receiving any request from parent or an assignee thereof under this section 10.2(g) the company agrees to send a copy thereof to parent and to any assignee thereof known to the company, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. 10.3 effect of termination. (a) the company shall pay parent a fee of $1,500,000 (the "company termination fee") in the event that (i) this agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) section 10.1(d)(i) or 10.1(e), or (y) section 10.1(f) if prior to the meeting of the stockholders of the company contemplated pursuant to section 6.4 an alternative proposal is publicly announced and the company consummates such alternative proposal within 12 months of the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 10.1(f), or (ii) the condition set forth in section 7.6 is not satisfied as a result of either (x) false or inaccurate statements made by the company in the representation letter delivered by the company to ernst & young or (y) a sale or other transfer after the date hereof of the capital stock of the company or of parent by an "affiliate" of the company, as such term is defined and used in accounting series releases 130 and 135, as amended; or (z) any action taken by the company subsequent to the date of this agreement. the company termination fee shall be payable by wire transfer of same day funds either on the date contemplated in the last sentence of section 10.1(d) if applicable, or otherwise, within two business days after such amount becomes due. the company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this section 10.3(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this agreement, and that, without these agreements, parent would not enter into this agreement; accordingly, if the company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this section 10.3(a) and, in order to obtain such payment, parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the company for the fee set forth in this section 10.3(a) the company shall pay to parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate of 10% per annum. page 44 (b) parent shall pay the company a fee of $1,500,000 (the"parent termination fee") in the event that (i) this agreement is terminated pursuant to section 10.1(d)(ii), or (ii) the condition set forth in section 7.6 is not satisfied as a result of either (x) false or inaccurate statements made by parent in the representation letter delivered by parent to ernst & young; or (y) a sale or other transfer after the date hereof of the capital stock of parent by an "affiliate" of parent, as such term is defined and used in accounting series releases 130 and 135, as amended; or (z) any action taken by parent subsequent to the date of this agreement. the parent termination fee shall be payable by wire transfer of same day funds within two business days after such amount becomes due. parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this section 10.3(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this agreement, and that, without these agreements, the company would not enter into this agreement; accordingly, if parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this section 10.3(a) and, in order to obtain such payment, the company commences a suit which results in a judgment against parent for the fee set forth in this section 10.3(a) parent shall pay to the company its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate of 10% per annum. (c) if this agreement is terminated pursuant to section 10.1, this agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that (a) the agreements contained in section 6.8, the last sentence of section 6.3 and sections 10.3(a) and 10.3(b) shall survive the termination hereof and (b) if termination of this agreement shall be judicially determined to have been caused by willful breach of this agreement, then, in addition to other remedies at law or equity for breach of this agreement, the party so found to have willfully breached this agreement shall indemnify the other parties for their respective costs, fees and expenses of their counsel, accountants and other experts and advisors as well as fees and expenses incident to negotiation,
