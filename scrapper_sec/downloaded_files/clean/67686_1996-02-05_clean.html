--------------------------------------------------- 5.1 right of first refusal. if during the term of the ---------------------- research and development agreement and for 2 years following its termination ecogen agrees to sell shares of its common stock or other voting securities ("ecogen securities") in a private or public offering other than (i) ecogen securities issued to ecogen employees or directors pursuant to ecogen's stock option plans, or to members of ecogen's scientific advisory board, or issued in connection with any stock options, warrants or other rights in existence as of the closing date, (ii) upon the conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of the date of this agreement, (iii) an equity investment in ecogen by the other party to, or partner in, any license agreement, research and development agreement, distribution agreement, joint-venture or other similar corporate alliance, provided that such equity investment is made as a condition to ecogen's good faith agreement to enter into such license agreement, research and development agreement, distribution agreement, joint-venture or other similar corporate alliance, (iv) in connection with a merger or acquisition, or (v) to any underwriter, placement agent or financial advisor in connection with any financing or other transaction by ecogen, and provided monsanto still owns all of the purchased shares at the time of such private or public offering, monsanto shall have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire upon the same terms and conditions applicable to such private or public offering all or any portion of such ecogen securities sufficient for monsanto to maintain after the offering the same percentage of ownership of issued and outstanding ecogen securities that monsanto possessed immediately prior to the offering (the "pre-offering percentage"). 5.2 private offering. with respect to a private ---------------- offering, ecogen shall no later than five (5) business days after the execution of any agreement entered into in connection with such private offering notify monsanto in writing of the proposed offering (a 24 29 "notice") which notice shall include the description of the securities proposed to be issued by ecogen and specify the number, price and payment and other terms, together with any letter of intent and the final contract, if available. monsanto shall have twenty (20) business days from the date of receipt of ecogen's notice in which to advise ecogen whether monsanto elects to exercise its rights under section . if monsanto does not respond, or if monsanto indicates that it will not exercise its rights, monsanto shall be considered irrevocably to have waived its rights under section 5.1 with respect to the private offering. if monsanto timely advises ecogen that monsanto will exercise its rights under section 5.1, monsanto shall have the right to acquire all or any portion of the necessary amount of the ecogen securities to maintain monsanto's pre-offering percentage at the price and upon the terms (other than any registration rights which are on terms different than those granted hereunder) specified in the notice. closing shall be in accordance with the terms of the private offering agreement, provided, however, that if such agreement provides for the payment of consideration other than cash, monsanto shall have the right to purchase its pre-offering percentage of shares for the cash equivalent amount of such other consideration. monsanto shall make such investment representations to ecogen and shall provide ecogen with such other documentation at closing as is reasonably required by ecogen to comply with applicable securities laws. the cash equivalent amount referred to above shall be determined by an independent third party reasonably agreed to by monsanto and ecogen (the costs and expenses of which shall be paid by ecogen). 5.3 public offering. with respect to a public --------------- offering, ecogen shall notify monsanto no later than five (5) business days after ecogen has entered into a letter of intent with its underwriters, and shall provide monsanto with a copy of any letter of intent with its underwriters. monsanto shall have twenty (20) business days from the date of receipt of ecogen's notice in which to advise ecogen whether monsanto elects to exercise its rights under section 51. if monsanto does not respond or if monsanto indicates that it will not exercise its rights, monsanto shall be considered irrevocably to have waived its rights under section 5.1 with respect to the public offering. if monsanto timely advises ecogen that monsanto desires to retain its rights under section 5.1, then when ecogen files a registration statement containing a preliminary prospectus with the commission, ecogen shall provide 25 30 monsanto with copies of the preliminary prospectus and all subsequent amendments. monsanto shall have twenty (20) business days from its receipt of the preliminary prospectus in which to exercise its rights under section 5.1 by making an offer to acquire all or any portion of the necessary amount of ecogen securities to maintain monsanto's pre-offering percentage based on the price and the other terms contained in the final prospectus, except that the price to be paid by monsanto shall be net of any underwriting discount and selling commissions. no such offer to buy shall be accepted prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. the registration statement shall indicate that monsanto has anti-dilution rights to purchase ecogen securities on the terms offered to the public. 5.4 limitations. notwithstanding the preceding ----------- provisions of this article v, ecogen shall not be required to issue any fractional shares as a result of monsanto's exercise of its rights under section 5.1. ecogen shall not be required to transfer any ecogen securities to monsanto under this article v, if to do so would result in the violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation. 5.5 limitations on monsanto's ownership. except for ----------------------------------- purchases of ecogen securities made in accordance with this article v, prior to the third anniversary of the closing, neither monsanto nor any of its affiliates shall directly or indirectly acquire any ecogen securities (except by way of stock dividends, stock splits, or similar events affecting holders of ecogen securities generally) if the effect of the acquisition would be to increase the aggregate voting power in the election of directors of all ecogen securities owned by monsanto and its affiliates to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total combined voting power of all ecogen securities then outstanding; provided, however, that nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed to prohibit monsanto and its affiliates from acquiring ecogen securities (through open market purchases or otherwise) so long as the effect of such acquisitions does not increase the aggregate voting power in the election of directors of all ecogen securities owned by monsanto and its affiliates to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total combined voting power of all ecogen securities then outstanding. notwithstanding the foregoing limitation: 26 31 (a) monsanto or any of its affiliates may acquire an unlimited percentage of ecogen securities prior to the third anniversary of the closing if any of the following events occur: (i) a tender or exchange offer is made by any person or 13d group (other than an affiliate of or person acting in concert with monsanto) to acquire ecogen securities and/or other securities of ecogen that, if added to the ecogen securities and other securities of ecogen already owned by that person or 13d group, would represent more than thirty percent (30%) of the total combined voting power or profit and loss participation of all ecogen securities and other securities of ecogen issued and outstanding; (ii) there is public disclosure that ecogen securities and/or other securities of ecogen representing more than thirty percent (30%) of the total combined voting power or profit and loss participation of all ecogen securities and other securities of ecogen issued and outstanding have been acquired or are proposed to be acquired by any person or 13d group (other than an affiliate of or person acting in concert with monsanto); (iii) any person or 13d group (other than an affiliate of or person acting in concert with monsanto) shall beneficially own ecogen securities representing more than thirty percent (30%) of the total combined voting power of all issued and outstanding ecogen securities; (iv) at any election or series of elections, persons not proposed for nomination or nominated by the management of ecogen are elected as directors of ecogen, and together constitute fifty percent (50%) or more of ecogen's board of directors; or (v) any person or 13d group (other than an affiliate of or person acting in concert with monsanto) solicits or receives valid proxies for the 27 32 election of ecogen's board of directors representing an aggregate of thirty percent (30%) or more of the total combined voting power of all ecogen securities issued and outstanding. (b) neither monsanto nor any of its affiliates shall be required to dispose of any shares of ecogen securities if their aggregate percentage ownership is increased as a result of ecogen's recapitalization or any other action taken by ecogen. as used herein, "13d group" means any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities that would be required under section 13(d) of the exchange act and the related rules and regulations (as now in effect, and based on present legal interpretations) to file a statement on schedule 13d or 13g with the commission as a "person" within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act if the group beneficially owned ecogen securities representing more than five percent (5%) of the total combined voting power of all ecogen securities then issued and outstanding. article vi. limitation on transfer ---------------------- 6.1 limitation on transfer. during the term of the ---------------------- research and development agreement, monsanto shall not directly or indirectly offer for sale, or transfer any common stock acquired by monsanto pursuant to this agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on transfers set forth in this section 6.1 shall terminate upon the occurrence of an event set forth in section 5.5(a). 28 33 article vii. registration rights ------------------- 7.1 requested registration. ---------------------- (a) request for registration. subject to section ------------------------ 6.1, holders of registrable securities shall have the right to request (with such requests in writing and stating the number of shares of registrable securities to be disposed of and the intended method of disposition of shares by such holders) up to two (2) registrations on form s-3 at ecogen's expense and an unlimited number of additional registrations on form s-3 at the selling holder's expense, provided that a request for registration includes at least fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate registrable securities held on such date and (ii) the requests for additional registrations are made by holders of at least twenty percent (20%) of the registrable securities, and (iii) such registerable securities have an aggregate offering price of at least $1,000,000 or represent all of the registerable securities of the holders held on such date, subject only to the following: (i) ecogen shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section 7.1 prior to the second anniversary of the closing unless monsanto otherwise has a right hereunder to sell registrable securities before such date. (ii) ecogen shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section 7.1 within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of the last such registration pursuant to this section 7.1. (iii) ecogen shall not be required to effect a registration in any particular jurisdiction in which ecogen would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance, unless ecogen is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the securities act or applicable rules or regulations thereunder. 29 34 (iv) ecogen shall not be required to effect a registration for a period of not more than ninety (90) days immediately following the delivery of a certificate signed by the president of ecogen to the requesting holders stating that, in the good-faith judgment of the board of directors of ecogen, it would be seriously detrimental to ecogen and its shareholders for a registration statement to be filed on or before the date filing would otherwise be required hereunder; provided, however, that ecogen may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period and ecogen may not exercise this right based on the fact that ecogen has recently registered any of its securities for the account of another security holder or holders exercising their respective demand registration rights. if ecogen cannot qualify for registration on form s-3, then ecogen shall effect any registration required or requested by the holder on form s-1, or such other appropriate form, in which event this section 7.1 shall apply in all respects as if the words "form s-3" were replaced by the words "form s-1" or the appropriate designation for such other form. (b) notice of inclusion. ecogen shall give ------------------- written notice to all holders of registrable securities of the receipt of a request for registration pursuant to this section 7.1 and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for other holders to participate in the registration; provided, however, that, if the registration is for an underwritten offering, then the terms of section 7.1(c) hereof shall apply to all participants in such offering. subject to the foregoing, ecogen shall use its best efforts to effect promptly the registration of all shares of registrable securities on form s-3 to the extent requested by the holder or holders thereof for purposes of disposition. (c) underwriting. if the requesting holders ------------ intend to distribute the registrable securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, then they shall so advise ecogen as a part of their request made pursuant to this section 7.1 and ecogen shall include such information in the written notice referred to in section 7.1(b) hereof. the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this section 7.1 shall be conditioned upon such 30 35 holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent requested and to the extent provided herein. ecogen shall (together with all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters of recognized national standing, selected for such underwriting by a majority in interest of the requesting holders and reasonably acceptable to ecogen. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 7.1, if the representative advises the requesting holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the requesting holders shall so advise all holders, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated first among all holders thereof in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities held by such holders at the time of filing the registration statement. no registrable securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. if any holder of registrable securities disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, then such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to ecogen, the underwriter and the requesting holders. the registrable securities and/or other securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from registration; provided, however, that, if, by the withdrawal of such registrable securities, a greater number of registrable securities held by other holders may be included in such registration (up to the maximum of any limitation imposed by the underwriters), then ecogen shall offer to all holders who have included registrable securities in the registration the right to include additional registrable securities in the same proportion used to determine the underwriter limitation in this section 7.1(c). if the underwriter has not limited the number of registrable securities to be underwritten, then ecogen and its executive officers, and such other persons as are determined by the board of directors, their successors, and their assigns ("other selling 31 36 stockholders"), may include securities for their own account in such registration if the underwriter so agrees and if the number of registrable securities held by the holders that would otherwise have been included in such registration and underwriting will not thereby be limited for any reason, including but not limited to the price for which the registrable securities will be sold. to the extent that the underwriter wishes to limit the number of shares to be included in the registration on behalf of ecogen and the other selling stockholders, the shares of common stock to be registered held by the other selling stockholders shall be excluded from such offering prior to excluding any shares held by ecogen and those held by ecogen shall be excluded prior to excluding any registrable securities held by the holders. 7.2 ecogen registration. ------------------- (a) notice and inclusion. subject to section -------------------- 6.1, if, at any time after the closing until the tenth anniversary of the closing, ecogen shall determine to register any of its securities for its own account, other than a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, or a registration relating solely to a commission rule 145 transaction, ecogen shall: (i) promptly give to each holder written notice thereof (which shall include a list of the jurisdictions in which ecogen intends to attempt to qualify such securities under the applicable blue sky or other state securities laws); and (ii) include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compli- ance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all registrable securities specified in a written request or requests, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the written notice from ecogen, by any holder or holders. (b) underwriting. if the registration of which ------------ ecogen gives notice is for a registered public offering by ecogen of its securities through an underwriting, then 32 37 ecogen shall so advise the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 7.2(a)(i) hereof. in such event, the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this section 7.2 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with ecogen, and all the other selling stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for underwriting by ecogen. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 7.2, if the underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the underwriter may exclude from such registration and underwriting some or all of the registrable securities held by the holders or the stock held by other selling stockholders in accordance with this section 7.2(b). ecogen shall so advise all holders and all other selling stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting, and (i) as to the first registration in which holders are entitled to participate pursuant to this section 7.2, the number of registrable securities and other securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all holders thereof on the basis that shares held by all the other selling stockholders who are not holders shall first be excluded to the extent required and, if further exclusion is necessary, shares held by the selling holders shall then be excluded; provided, however, that, as among the respective other selling stockholders as a group on the one hand and the holders as a group on the other hand suffering such exclusion, the exclusion shall be in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the amount of securities entitled to inclusion in such registration held by each of the other selling stockholders as a group and each of the holders at the time of filing the registration statement; and (ii) as to all subsequent registrations, the number of shares of registrable securities and other securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all other selling stockholders and the holders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of securities entitled to inclusion in such registration held by all such other selling stockholders and holders at the time of filing the registration statement. for purposes of the apportionment provisions in clause (i) above, for any selling holder that is a partnership or corporation, the partners, retired partners, and shareholders of 33 38 such holder, the estate and family members of such partners and retired partners, and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single "selling holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such selling holder shall be based upon the aggregate number of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such "selling holder," as defined in this sentence. if any other selling stockholder or holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to ecogen and the underwriter. any securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. 7.3 expenses of registration. all registration ------------------------ expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this article vii shall be borne by ecogen; provided, however, that the registration expenses for the third and all subsequent registrations under section 7.1(a) hereof requested by the holders shall be borne by the requesting holders pro rata on the basis of the number of their shares so registered. all selling expenses relating to the securities registered by holders and, if applicable, other selling stockholders, and fees and disbursements of counsel, shall be borne by the holders or the other selling stockholders, as the case may be, of such securities pro rata on the basis of the number of their shares so registered. 7.4 registration procedures. ----------------------- (a) ecogen shall use its best efforts to register or qualify the registrable securities covered by a registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such united states jurisdictions as holder shall reasonably request and do any and all acts and things which may be necessary or desirable to enable holder to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that ecogen shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdictions. (b) ecogen represents and warrants that, on the date of its effectiveness, the registration statement will comply in all material respects with the 34 39 applicable requirements of the securities act and the rules thereunder, including without limitation rule 415; on the date of its effectiveness, the registration statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading; provided, however, that no representation is made by ecogen with respect to information relative to any holder; and the prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no representation is made by ecogen with respect to information relative to any holder. (c) if, at any time or times while the registration statement is effective, ecogen notifies holder that a development has occurred or is pending which, based upon consultation with ecogen's legal counsel, ecogen reasonably believes may cause the then current prospectus not to be in compliance with applicable securities laws, then holder shall refrain from delivering the prospectus and from making any offers or sales of registrable securities requiring the delivery of the prospectus until such time as ecogen either notifies holder that the prospectus complies with such laws or delivers an amended prospectus in replacement of the deficient prospectus. ecogen shall use its reasonable best efforts to minimize the time during which holder must so refrain, and no more than one (1) such period of refrain shall be imposed during any period of one hundred eighty (180) days. (d) at least two (2) business days prior to the initial filing of the registration statement or prospectus and no fewer than two (2) business days prior to the filing of any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), ecogen shall furnish each selling holder, its legal counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) shall be subject to review of such holder, its legal counsel and such underwriters, if any, and ecogen shall cause its officers and directors and the independent certified public accountants to ecogen to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the opinion of respective counsel to ecogen and any such underwriters, to 35 40 conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the securities act. ecogen shall not file any such registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which a selling holder, its legal counsel, or the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object on a timely basis (i.e., within two (2) business days of receipt thereof). ---- (e) ecogen shall promptly notify each selling holder when the registration statement is declared effective; notify holder of any stop-order or similar proceeding by the commission or any state securities authority; and furnish such number of prospectuses, prospectus supplements and other documents incident thereto as holder from time to time may reasonably request. (f) in the event of any breach by ecogen of the provisions of section 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, the parties agree that each holder will suffer irreparable harm. accordingly, the parties agree that the provisions of sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 are specifically enforceable by each holder and that each holder shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief against ecogen and the other rights and remedies to which each holder may be entitled to at law, in equity or under this agreement for any such breach. 7.5 indemnification. --------------- (a) indemnification by ecogen. ecogen shall ------------------------- indemnify each holder with respect to which registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this article vii, each of its officers, directors, employees, agents and partners, each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue 36 41 statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto or incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by ecogen of the securities act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to ecogen and relating to action or inaction required of ecogen in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. ecogen shall reimburse each such holder, each of its officers, directors, employees, agents and partners, and each person controlling such holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such expense, claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that ecogen shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability, action or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to ecogen by an instrument duly executed by such holder or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein. (b) indemnification by the holders. to the ------------------------------ extent set forth in the second sentence of this section 7.5(b), each holder shall, if registrable securities or other securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify ecogen, each of its directors, officers, employees and agents, each underwriter, if any, of registrable securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls ecogen or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, each other such holder, each of such other holder's officers, directors, employees, agents and partners, and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact made 37 42 by the holder and contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto or incident to any such registration, qualification or compliance or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be made by the holder and stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or any violation by ecogen of any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act applicable to ecogen in connection with such registration, qualification or compliance as a result of any statement (or based on any omission to state or alleged omission) required to be made by such holder. each such holder shall reimburse ecogen, such other holders, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, persons, underwriters and control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such expense, claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the holder to ecogen by an instrument duly executed by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the obligations of such holders hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to each such holder of registrable securities sold as contemplated herein in connection with the particular registration, qualification or compliance involved. (c) notice. each party entitled to ------ indemnification under this section 7.5 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided, however, that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and that the indemnified party may participate in such defense at its own expense; and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve 38 43 the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 7.5 unless such failure is materially detrimental to the indemnifying party. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 7.6 information by holder. each holder or holders of --------------------- registrable securities in any registration shall furnish to ecogen such information regarding such holder or holders and the distribution proposed by such holder or holders as ecogen may reasonably request in writing but only to the extent as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this article vii. 7.7 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making ------------------ available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may permit the sale of the restricted securities or control securities to the public without registration, ecogen agrees to: (a) use its best efforts to make and keep public information available as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act; (b) use its best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of ecogen under the securities act and the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements); (c) for so long as a holder owns any restricted securities or
