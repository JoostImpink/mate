(iii) tcgi agrees to pay and to indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless the stockholders and their successors from and against (i) any and all booked taxes and (ii) any and all taxes of the company payable with respect to, and any and all indemnifiable tax damages, arising out of or in any manner incident, relating or attributable to taxes of the company payable with respect to, or tax returns required to be filed by the company with respect to, (a) any reporting period of the company beginning after the date on which the effective time occurs; and (b) any reporting period that includes the date on which the effective time occurs but only for that portion of such period commencing the day after such date. (c) any tax sharing agreement, practice, or other similar arrangement between the company and corporations or other entities related to the company shall be terminated as to the company as of the closing date. (d) the company has calculated its federal income tax liability (or credit for the tax benefits of losses) as if it was a separate unaffiliated corporation and makes payments to (or received credits from) tenaya corporation accordingly. (e) except as otherwise provided in this section 6.5, any amounts owed by the stockholders to any party under this section 6.5 shall be paid within ten (10) business days of notice from such party; provided that if such party has not paid such amounts and such amounts are being contested before the appropriate governmental authorities in good faith, the stockholders shall not be required to make payment until it is determined finally by an appropriate governmental authority or court that payment is due. except as otherwise provided in this section 6.5, any amounts owed by tcgi to any party under this section 6.5 shall be paid within ten business days of notice from such party; provided that if such party has not paid such amounts and such amounts are being contested before the appropriate governmental authorities in good faith, neither tcgi nor the company shall be required to make payment until it is determined finally by an appropriate governmental authority or court that payment is due. any amounts that are not paid within the period provided in this section 6.5 shall accrue interest at the "underpayment rate" under section 6621 of the code for the underpayment of taxes by corporations. (f) the tax liabilities for each short period for the company shall be determined by closing the books and records of the company as of the date on which the effective time occurs, by treating each such short period as if it were a separate reporting period, and by employing accounting methods which are consistent with those employed in preparing the tax returns for the company in prior reporting periods and which do not have the effect of distorting income or expenses (taking into account the transactions contemplated by this agreement), except that taxes based on items other than income or sales shall be computed for the reporting period beginning on the first day of the applicable short period and prorated on a time basis between the short period and the period beginning on the first day after the date on which the effective time occurs and ending on the last day of the reporting period which includes the effective time; provided that with respect to any tax which is not in effect during the entire short period, the proration of such tax shall be based on the period during the short period that such tax was in effect. it is agreed that any tax liability arising out of the cerfnet germany dividend, and any taxes or tax deductions relating to the incentive agreements, shall be allocated for purposes of this agreement to the period ending on or prior to the date on which the effective time occurs. (g) tcgi shall promptly notify the stockholders in writing of any notice, letter, correspondence, claim, determination, decision or decree ("tax claim") received by tcgi or the surviving corporation or their successors relating solely to any reporting period ending on or before the closing date that might raise a claim for indemnification hereunder. the stockholders, at their cost and expense, shall have the sole and exclusive right to (and shall promptly notify tcgi as to whether or not they will) handle, answer, defend, compromise or settle such tax claim and any tax examination, audit, contest or litigation in connection therewith; provided that the stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of any interest and penalties resulting from any delay by the stockholders in payment of the tax claim. if the stockholders fail within a reasonable time after notice to defend or handle any tax claim or any examination, audit, contest or litigation as provided herein, the stockholders shall be bound by the results obtained by tcgi or the surviving corporation in connection with such tax claim and such examination, audit, contest or litigation. tcgi shall cause the surviving corporation to give promptly to the stockholders any relevant information relating to such tax claim which may be particularly within the knowledge of the surviving corporation and otherwise to cooperate fully with the stockholders in good faith with respect to such tax claim. notwithstanding the foregoing, the stockholders shall not agree, without the consent of tcgi (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to any adjustment for any reporting period ending on or prior to the date on which the effective time occurs which will legally bind tcgi or the surviving corporation for any period after such date. tcgi shall have the sole and exclusive right to handle, answer, defend, compromise or settle tax claim relating to taxable years or periods (including such period that includes a short period) ending after the date on which the effective time occurs. notwithstanding the foregoing, tcgi shall not agree, without the consent of the stockholders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to any adjustment for any period ending after the date on which the effective time occurs (including such period that includes a short period) which will legally bind the stockholders or the company for any period ending on or prior to such date (including such period that includes a short period). (h) the stockholders shall be responsible for preparing and filing on behalf of the company all tax returns for reporting periods of the company ending on or before the date on which the effective time occurs, including tax returns of the company for such periods which are due after such date, and the stockholders shall be responsible for the contents of such returns; provided, however, that the stockholders shall furnish tcgi and the company or its successors with copies of such returns of the company (or, in the case of consolidated or combined tax returns of the ga affiliated group, appropriate portions thereof), within 30 days following the filing date. tcgi shall be responsible for preparing and filing all tax returns of the company and the surviving corporation for reporting periods ending after the date on which the effective time occurs (including for reporting periods beginning before and ending after such date); provided, however, that tcgi shall furnish the stockholders with copies of such returns to the extent they relate to reporting periods beginning before and ending after such date. tcgi shall provide the stockholders with a substantially complete draft of each tax return for a reporting period that begins before and ends after the date on which the effective time occurs a reasonable time prior to the filing of such returns. stockholders shall have the right to comment on such returns and tcgi shall consider in good faith any such comments. (i) if the company or a member of the tcgi affiliated group has any reduction in tax liability in any period beginning after the date on which the effective time occurs by reason of an adjustment to the taxes of the company or the ga affiliated group for any period (including a short period) ending on or prior to the date on which the effective time occurs that produces a tax detriment to the stockholders, the company or the ga consolidated group, then tcgi shall pay to the stockholders the lesser of (i) the amount of such tax detriment and (ii) the present value, as of the time payment is due under this section 6.5(i), of such reduction in tax liability (based on a good faith determination by the parties as to the value and timing of such amounts) promptly after the amount payable under this section 6.5(i) is determined. (j) each of the parties hereto will provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any tax return (including the periods ending december 31, 1996 and as of the closing date and any amended tax returns and claims for tax refunds), any audit or other examination by any tax authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for taxes, and each will retain until the expiration of any relevant statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the other party, any extension thereof) and provide the other, at all reasonable times, with any work papers, records or other information which may be relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceeding or determination (including, but not limited to, determinations under this section 6.5). the party requesting assistance or documents hereunder shall reimburse the other parties for reasonable expenses incurred in providing such assistance or documents. within ninety days after the closing date, the stockholders will assist tcgi in preparing a schedule setting forth (i) the tax basis of the assets of the company as of the date on which the effective time occurs and (ii) and consents or elections made under the code or any state tax law by the company or any member of the ga affiliated group with respect to the company. (k) it is the intention of the parties that the merger shall qualify as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the code, and the parties agree that each shall report the transaction accordingly for federal income tax purposes. the parties further agree that each shall act in accordance with that stated intention of the parties. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in a transaction pursuant to a current plan or intention of tcgi, sub or the surviving corporation or pursuant to a transaction that is integrated with the merger, tcgi shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, cause the surviving corporation to do any of the following in a manner which causes the merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code: (i) sell or otherwise dispose of a material portion of its assets except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business, (ii) fail to continue in all material respects the historic business of the company or (iii) merge with, consolidate with or liquidate into another entity or otherwise fail to continue the surviving corporation as a corporate entity. tcgi shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, dispose of a material portion of the stock of the surviving corporation either in a transaction pursuant to a current plan or intention of tcgi, sub or the surviving corporation or pursuant to a transaction that is integrated with the merger, in a manner which causes the merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code. each party hereto shall notify the others if it receives notice from any tax authority that such tax authority asserts that the merger does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under section 368(a) of the code. the party receiving such notice shall keep the other party advised of the proceedings with respect to such dispute and shall advise the other party of the final resolution thereof. (l) notwithstanding section 10.1, the representations, warranties, and covenants contained in section 3.17 and in this section 6.5 shall expire upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. the indemnification provided for in this section 6.5 shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10 and shall constitute a separate and distinct indemnification obligation of the parties hereto. 6.6 certain contracts.

provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to (i) the representations and warranties contained in section 3.17 and 3.20 and the covenants contained in section 6.5, which shall continue to survive for the applicable statute of limitations periods and the representations and warranties set forth in sections 3.5, 3.23, 4.3 and 4.5, all of which shall continue to survive indefinitely. 10.2 indemnification by tcgi. subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement, tcgi and sub shall, jointly and severally, indemnify each of the stockholders, the company and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, against and hold such persons harmless from all demands, claims, losses, costs, fines, liabilities, damages (excluding consequential damages), including reasonable fees and expenses incurred in the investigation and defense of claims and actions whether such claims and actions are brought by third parties or either party hereto (collectively, "losses"), arising out of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of tcgi herein. 10.3 indemnification by the stockholders. subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement, the stockholders shall, jointly and severally, indemnify tcgi, sub and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, against and hold such persons harmless from all losses arising out of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the stockholders herein. 10.4 claims. if any claim or assertion of liability is made or asserted against a party entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this section 10 (an "indemnified party") by any person who is not a party to this agreement, the indemnified party shall give to the other party (an "indemnifying party") prompt written notice in reasonable detail of such claim or assertion, or of any event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party of which it has knowledge, concerning any liability or damage as to which it may request indemnification hereunder. the failure by an indemnified party to give notice on a timely basis, as provided in this section 10 shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section except to the extent that the failure results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party is damaged or prejudiced solely as a result of the failure to give notice. thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver promptly to the indemnifying party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the third-party claim. the indemnifying party shall have the right to direct, through counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense; provided that the indemnifying party shall not have the right to control the defense of any such claim or proceeding unless it has acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party fully from all liabilities incurred as a result of such claim or proceeding (subject, however, to section 10.5). if the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnified party may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnified party; provided, however, that if the indemnified party asserts that there exists a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the counsel for the indemnifying party concurs with such assertion, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel. the indemnified party shall provide the indemnifying party with access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. if the indemnifying party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnified party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability, unless the indemnifying party, subject to the penultimate sentence of this section 10.4, withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the indemnifying party is entered against the indemnified party for such liability. if the indemnifying party fails to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the indemnifying party fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the indemnifying party's expense. if the indemnified party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this section 10.4 and proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego appeal with respect thereto, then the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding. the indemnifying party shall not settle any claim or assertion, unless the indemnified party consents in writing to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 10.3 certain limitations on indemnification. (a) the stockholders shall have no liability under section 10.3 unless the aggregate of all losses relating thereto for which the stockholders would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). if such losses exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the stockholders shall be required to indemnify tcgi and sub for the full amount of such losses, subject to the other limitations of this section 10. (b) the stockholders shall not have any liability under section 10.3 for any individual item where the loss relating to such item is less than $5,000. (c) the aggregate liability of the stockholders under section 10.3 shall in no event exceed the value of the merger consideration, determined as of the closing date. 10.6 exclusive remedy. tcgi and sub acknowledge and agree that, from and after the closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this agreement shall be the indemnification provisions set forth in sections 6.5 and 10. in furtherance of the foregoing, each of tcgi and sub hereby waives, from and after the closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (other than tort claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraudulent misrepresentation) it may have against the stockholders relating to the subject matter of this agreement arising or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. each of tcgi and sub further acknowledges and agrees that (i) other than the representations and warranties of the stockholders and the company specifically contained in this agreement (including the schedules hereto), there are

and (b) subject to the terms and conditions hereof, include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the registrable securities specified in a written request or requests, made within 15 days after receipt of such written notice from the company described in section 2.1(a), by any holder or holders. 2.2 underwriting. (a) if the registration of which the company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the company shall so advise the holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 2.1(a). in such event, the right of any holder to registration pursuant to this article 2 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the company) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by the company, with all such holders agreeing to the same terms and conditions as the company to the extent the company is also seeking to distribute securities as part of such underwritten offering. in any such underwritten offering, the range for the offering price at which registrable securities and other securities included in such underwritten offering shall be offered for sale, as set forth in the preliminary prospectus for such offering, and the price at which such registrable securities and other securities included in such underwritten offering shall be sold to the public, as set forth in the prospectus for such offering, shall be mutually determined by the company and the managing underwriter(s) for such offering. (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this article 2, if the managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the underwriter may exclude some or all registrable securities from such registration and underwriting. the company shall so advise all holders of registrable securities, and the number of shares of registrable securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated as follows: first, for the account of the company, all shares of common stock proposed to be sold by the company; second, for the account of any stockholders of the company having registration rights existing prior to the date of this agreement (and their respective successors and assigns) and participating in such registration, the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in the registration by such stockholders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities that are proposed to be offered and sold by such stockholders of registrable securities at the time of filing the registration statement; third, for the account of holders of registrable securities participating in such registration and any stockholders having registration rates of equal priority with the holders, the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in the registration by such holders or such other stockholders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities that are proposed to be offered and sold by such holders and such other stockholders of registrable securities at the time of filing the registration statement; and fourth, for the account of any other stockholders of the company participating in such registration, the number of shares of common stock requested to be included in the registration by such other stockholders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities that are proposed to be offered and sold by such other stockholders of registrable securities at the time of filing the registration statement. no registrable securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriters' marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. (c) the company shall so advise all holders and the other stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting of any such limitation, and the number of shares of registrable securities held by holders that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all holders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of registrable securities held by all such holders at the time of filing the registration statement. if any holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the managing underwriter prior to the initial distribution of preliminary prospectuses with respect to such underwritten offering or at such earlier time as the company may prescribe. any securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration, but the holder shall continue to be bound by article 6 hereof. if registrable securities are not withdrawn by such time, the holder of such registrable securities shall have no right to withdraw such registrable securities from such registration and shall be obligated to sell such registrable securities at a price per share (the "sale price") to be determined by the company and the managing underwriter(s) for such underwritten offering, provided that such sale price is either within the range set forth on the cover of the preliminary prospectus relating to such underwritten offering or is in excess of the highest offering price set forth in such range. any registrable securities that are withdrawn from registration pursuant to this section 2.2(c) shall not be transferred in a public distribution prior to 90 days after the effective date of such registration, or such other shorter period of time as the managing underwriter(s) for such registration may require. (d) the company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this article 2 prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not any holder has elected to include securities in such registration; provided, however, that the company shall pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with such terminated registration. article 3 expenses of registration in connection with any registration or qualification pursuant to article 2 hereof, the registering holders shall bear a portion of the registration expenses equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of securities that are registered by such holders in connection with such registration and the denominator of which is equal to the amount of all securities that are included in such registration. all selling expenses relating to securities registered by the holders shall be borne by such holders. each holder shall bear any other out-of-pocket expenses of such holder incurred in connection with any registration hereunder. article 4 registration procedures in the case of each registration, qualification or compliance effected by the company pursuant to this agreement, the company will keep each holder participating in such registration advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration, qualification and compliance and as to the completion thereof. at its expense the company will, in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering, and each holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement. the company shall furnish to each holder participating in any registration and the underwriters such number of copies of the registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as such parties may reasonably request. article 5 indemnification 5.1 indemnification by company. in the event the company shall effect a registration of any shares owned by any holder, the company will indemnify each holder and each of its directors and officers and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, or arising out of or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each such holder, director or officer and each person controlling such holder, each such underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, (i) made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder or underwriter and expressly intended for use in such registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) made in any preliminary prospectus or prospectus if the company shall have corrected such statement or omission and timely furnished a copy of an amended or supplemented prospectus to such holder or to the person alleging the omission or misstatement prior to the time of written confirmation of such sale of registrable securities. 5.2 indemnification by the holders. in the event the company shall effect a registration of any shares owned by any holder, each such holder will, severally and not jointly, indemnify the company, each underwriter and each of its respective officers and directors, if any, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the company or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act, and each other such holder, and each person controlling such holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration or arising out of or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse the company, such holders, director or officer, such underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement or prospectus or amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder and expressly intended for use in such registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; provided, however, that the maximum liability of any holder under this section 5.2 in regard to any registration statement shall in no event exceed the amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities under such registration statement. 5.3 procedures for indemnification. each party entitled to indemnification under this article 5 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed). the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided, however that if (i) the employment of such counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have been advised by its counsel that there is a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, then in each such case the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party). the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this agreement, unless such failure is materially prejudicial to the ability of the indemnifying party to defend the action. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. 5.4 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in section 5.1 or 5.2 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses referred to in section 5.1 or 5.2, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company on the one hand and the sellers of registrable securities on the other hand in connection with statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 5.4 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if all sellers of registrable securities were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this section 5.4. the amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses referred to in the first sentence of this section 5.4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any claim, action or proceeding which is the subject of this section 5.4. notwithstanding the provisions or this section 5.4, no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total proceeds received by it from the sale of its registrable securities pursuant to the applicable registration statement exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay pursuant to this agreement by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the obligations of sellers of registrable securities to contribute pursuant to this section 5.4 shall be several in proportion to the respective amount of registrable securities sold by them pursuant to a registration statement and not joint. 5.5 conflicting terms. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. article 6 lockup agreement in consideration for the company agreeing to its obligations under this agreement, each holder agrees, in connection with any registration effected pursuant to article 2, that any holder electing not to participate in, or withdrawing from, such registration shall, upon the request of the underwriters managing the offering of the company's securities, not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities (other than those included in such registration) without the prior written consent of such underwriters until such period of time (not to exceed the period commencing seven (7) days prior to the effective date of such registration and ending ninety (90) days after such effective date) from the effective date of such registration or, if earlier, the day distribution of such securities is completed or the underwriters have sold all securities of the company allotted to them pursuant to such registration. article 7 information by holder the holder or holders of registrable securities included in any registration shall furnish in writing to the company such information regarding such holder or holders and the distribution proposed by such holder or holders as the company may request and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this agreement. article 8 transfer of registration rights the rights to cause the company to register registrable securities granted to any holder under article 2 may be assigned to a transferee or assignee in connection with any transfer or assignment of registrable securities by such holder; provided that no transfer or assignment shall be made pursuant to this article 8 unless: (a) notice of such assignment is given to the company, (b) the company shall have received either (i) a written opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the company, addressed to the company, to the effect that the proposed transfer of registrable securities, or of an interest therein, may be effected without registration under the securities act or under applicable state securities laws or (ii) such representation letters as it may reasonably require, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company, to ensure compliance with the provisions of the securities act and applicable state securities laws, and (c) such transferee or assignee shall have executed and delivered to the company, as a condition to its acquisition of such registrable securities, an instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the company confirming that such transferee takes such registrable securities, or interest therein, subject to, and agrees to be bound by, all the terms, conditions and obligations of this agreement. article 9 miscellaneous 9.1 waivers and amendments. with the written consent of the company and the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding, the obligations and rights of the company and the holders under this agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance, either retroactively or prospectively, and either for a specified period of time or indefinitely) or amended; provided, however, that no such waiver or amendment shall reduce the aforesaid number of shares the holders of which are required to consent to any waiver or amendment, without the consent of all the holders. this agreement or any provision hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated only by a statement in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the amendment, waiver, discharge or termination is sought, except to the extent provided in this section 9.1. 9.2 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within the state without regard to principles of conflicts of law. 9.3 successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. 9.4 entire agreement. this agreement constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof. 9.5 notices. all notices, requests, consents, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given and received upon

of this agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 9.7 titles and subtitles. the titles of the sections and subsections of this agreement are for convenience of reference only and
