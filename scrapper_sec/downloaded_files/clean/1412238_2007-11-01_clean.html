(h) any proposed sale to a third party pursuant to this section 4.3 shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules, including, without limitation, all securities laws and such proposed sale shall be consummated within 30 days from the delivery of the drag along notice; provided that if the sale of such shares is subject to any prior regulatory approval or consent, the time period during which such sale may be consummated may be extended (but not to exceed 120 days in the aggregate from the date of execution of such agreement) until the expiration of ten business days after all such approvals and consents shall have been received. shareholders shall use all reasonable endeavors to obtain such consents and approvals as may be required in order for them to comply with the provisions of this section 4.3. (i) promptly after the consummation of the sale of shares of the section 4.3 seller and the non-selling shareholders pursuant to section 4.3(f) or (g), the section 4.3 seller shall (i) give notice thereof to asat and (ii) furnish such other evidence of the completion and time of completion of such sale and the terms thereof as may be reasonably requested by asat. &#160; 19 exhibit 99.3 &#160; (j) notwithstanding anything contained in this section 4.3, there shall be no liability on the part of the section 4.3 seller to any of the non-selling shareholders if the sale of shares to a third party pursuant to this section 4.3 is not consummated for whatever reason. any decision as to whether to sell shares shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of the section 4.3 seller. (k) save as otherwise provided in this section 4.3(k), if at any time qpl owns less than 50% of the outstanding shares (including as a result of a transfer pursuant to section 4.4 or otherwise), this section 4.3 shall be deemed permanently amended to delete qpl from the definition of "section 4.3 seller" and to eliminate any right of qpl to exercise any rights under section 4.3. if at any time the investors collectively own less than 50% of the outstanding shares (including as a result of a transfer pursuant to section 4.4 or otherwise), this section 4.3 shall be deemed permanently amended to delete aof and caip from the definition of "section 4.3 seller" and to eliminate any right of aof and caip to exercise any rights under section 4.3. following an initial public offering by asat, public sale by qpl or the investors (as applicable), issue of shares upon exercise of the warrants or issue of shares to employees of any asat company pursuant to an exercise of stock options granted to such employee, this section 4.3(k) shall remain in effect and the 50% threshold referred to above shall be reduced to reflect the dilutive effect or reduction of the numbers of shares held by qpl or the investors as a result of such event. (l) notwithstanding any provision in any lender share charge, any lender facility or any other agreement between qpl and any lender (including their affiliates), if caip or aof is the section 4.3 seller and a charge transfer or qpl bankruptcy event shall have occurred or is in the process of occurring, caip and aof may exercise their drag along rights under this section 4.3 in respect of any shares subject to any lender share charge under which such charge transfer has occurred or is in the process of occurring, or held by such lender or any lender transferee and, in the case of a qpl bankruptcy event, any shares held by qpl whether or not the required drag along sale price condition of section 4.3(a) is satisfied, provided that the required drag along sale price is not less than the lower of (x) the required drag along sale price and (y) fair market value per share on the last nasdaq national market system trading day immediately preceding the beginning of the right of first refusal notice period. (m) if upon the enforcement of its rights under its lender share charge, any lender desires to effect a charge transfer, either directly or through qpl, by way of a public sale, it may do so notwithstanding the restrictions of section 4.3(n), provided that the exclusions of this section 4.3(m) apply only to such lender and any nominee which is to be the holder of such shares on such lender's behalf and shall not apply to any such lender transferee, except for a lender transferee that acquires the shares by way of a public sale. &#160; 20 exhibit 99.3 &#160; (n) if any shareholder delivers a right of first offer notice pursuant to section 4.1 and clause (ii) of section 4.3(a), stating that it intends to exercise its drag along rights pursuant to this section 4.3, no shareholder may transfer any shares during the related right of first offer notice period or the immediately following right of first refusal notice period, provided that each lender may enforce its rights during these periods pursuant to its lender share charge to cause qpl to effect a transfer to such lender or any nominee thereof which is to be the holder of such shares on such lender's behalf. 4.4 lender share charge.
