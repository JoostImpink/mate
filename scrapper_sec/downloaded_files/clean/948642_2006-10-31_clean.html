(d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of telecom italia. on october 18, 2006, each of pirelli & c., edizione holding, edizione finance, olimpia s.p.a. ("olimpia"), assicurazioni generali s.p.a. ("generali") and the reporting person entered into the 2006 shareholders agreement relating to, among other things, certain telecom italia shares held by each of olimpia, generali and the reporting person (collectively, the "affected parties") comprising, in aggregate, 23.2% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares. an english translation of the 2006 shareholders agreement is filed as exhibit 1. the 2006 shareholders agreement applies to (i) all of telecom italia shares held by olimpia, (ii) certain telecom italia shares held by generali (comprising 3.67% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares) and (iii) certain telecom italia shares held by the reporting person (comprising 1.54% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares). telecom italia shares that are subject to the 2006 shareholders agreement are referred to below as "affected shares". the parties to the 2006 shareholders agreement agree to form a board of representatives (the "shareholders board") which has certain decision-making functions under the agreement. each of generali and the reporting person (and any additional party that is admitted to the agreement in the future) will have the right to appoint one member to the shareholders board, and olimpia will have the right to appoint a number of members equal to the aggregate of the number of all other members of the shareholders board. olimpia will also have the right to appoint the chairman of the shareholders board. the shareholders board will meet prior to each shareholders meeting of telecom italia to discuss all matters that are scheduled to be voted upon by the holders of telecom italia shares at such shareholders meeting. if the members of the shareholders board unanimously agree on how the affected shares shall be voted in relation to a particular matter, then each of the affected parties will be required to vote all of its affected shares in that manner. if the members of the shareholders board do not unanimously agree as to how the affected shares shall be voted, then the affected parties will be free to vote the affected shares held by them at their own discretion. during the term of the 2006 shareholders agreement, each of the affected parties is prohibited from transferring more than 20% of the number of affected shares that it owns as of the date of the agreement (whether directly, or through derivative or other arrangements that have the effect of transferring the economic risks or benefits associated with the ownership of such shares). page 5 of 10 each of the reporting person and generali may acquire additional telecom italia shares, provided that such party does not at any time hold an aggregate number of telecom italia shares that exceeds by more than 25% the number of affected shares held by such party as of the date of execution of the 2006 shareholders agreement. any telecom italia shares so acquired by the reporting person or generali will be deemed affected shares. no party to the 2006 shareholders agreement may purchase any telecom italia shares without first notifying the shareholders board and the other parties to the 2006 shareholders agreement. also, each party must promptly notify the shareholders board and each other party in the event that it transfers any telecom italia shares. under the 2006 shareholders agreement, each of generali and the reporting person has certain rights of first refusal that are triggered in the event that olimpia proposes to transfer all (but not less than all) of its telecom italia shares to any third party. however, such rights of first refusal will not arise if the applicable third party acquiror also offers to acquire telecom italia shares held by generali and/or the reporting person on the same terms and conditions that it proposes to acquire telecom italia shares held by olimpia. generali and the reporting person also have rights of first refusal that are triggered in the event that pirelli & c. (whether acting alone or together with edizione finance or edizione holding) proposes to transfer more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of olimpia to a third party. olimpia is required to promptly consult with each of generali and the reporting person if (i) any third party makes an offer to become a shareholder of olimpia by making a capital contribution thereto in the form of telecom italia shares and (ii) such capital contribution would result in olimpia's aggregate holding of telecom italia shares being in excess of a certain threshold prescribed under applicable italian law so as to require olimpia to make a mandatory tender offer for telecom italia shares. in that event, generali and the reporting person will have the option to either (i) become shareholders of olimpia by contributing their respective telecom italia shares thereto on the same terms and conditions proposed by the third party or (ii) reduce their respective holdings of telecom italia shares by such amount as may be necessary to ensure that olimpia is not required under applicable italian law to make a tender offer for telecom italia shares. if generali and the reporting person do not (within such reasonable time as olimpia may stipulate) commit to take those actions set forth in either of clauses (i) and (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence, then olimpia may accept the offer of the third party and terminate the shareholders agreement. the 2006 shareholders agreement has an initial term of three years, and shall automatically be renewed for successive periods of three years unless any party delivers a notice of termination to each other party at least three months prior to the expiration of the then-current term. the 2006 shareholders agreement provides that holders of 0.5% or more of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares may be admitted as additional parties to the agreement from time to time with the unanimous consent of the existing parties thereto. pirelli & c., edizione holding, edizione finance, generali and the reporting person issued a joint press release concerning the 2006 shareholders agreement on october 18, 2006, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 2. 7. materials to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1: shareholders agreement, dated as of october 18, 2006, by and among pirelli & c, edizione holding, edizione finance, olimpia, generali and mediobanca.

rights in telecom shareholders' meeting. 6. save for the unanimous consent of all the parties and for what provided under article 7, for the duration of this agreement each party which has tied-up telecom shares to this agreement as per article 3 undertakes that it shall not transfer (and shall procure that no transfer is made) of any such telecom shares except for a maximum of 20% of the holding tied-up in this agreement by each of the parties at the time of its execution as per whereas b; save for the possibility to repurchase any such telecom shares (which shall be tied-up again to this agreement) within said 20% limit. for the purposes of this agreement, "transfer" shall mean (i) any sort of sale, both universal and singular, for free and for consideration, and (ii) any transaction, act or agreement, universal or singular, for free or for consideration, by virtue of which it is achieved directly or indirectly (also through the transfer of holdings in companies which hold directly or indirectly telecom shares tied-up in this agreement) the direct or indirect transfer of the ownership (also by way of the execution of derivatives or other kinds of agreements, which effect is to transfer to third parties the financial exposure to the ownership of the tied-up shares) or of any other right arising out or anyway connected to such shares. it is understood that any transfer and/or any subsequent repurchase of telecom shares within the above-mentioned limits shall be promptly communicated to the board and to the parties. it is also understood that olimpia shall not be prevented by this paragraph from creating a pledge on telecom shares in fulfilment of obligations already existing at the date of execution of this agreement. in derogation of the previous paragraph, the transfer of the tied-up shares of a party shall be permitted within the reference group of such party, as long as the transferee is controlled directly or indirectly, by the transferor and the transferee undertakes the obligations provided in this agreement. for the purposes of this provision, control shall be deemed existing only in the case provided for by article 2359, paragraph 1, no. 1), of the italian civil code. in further derogation of the first paragraph, should olimpia intend to transfer the entire (and not part of the) interest held by same in telecom to one or more third party purchasers, acting in concert with each other, who have submitted an offer to buy, olimpia shall allow that generali and mediobanca exercise a right of first refusal on such interest, by notifying through registered mail to generali and mediobanca the economic terms offered for the purchase of the interest and the term (which shall in no event be prior to fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice) within which the right of first refusal can be exercised. generali and mediobanca shall be entitled to exercise the right of first refusal jointly, on a pro-rata basis, or individually for the entire participation held by olimpia in telecom and at the same economic terms offered by the third party purchaser/s, through registered mail to be received by olimpia within the term indicated by same in accordance with the previous paragraph. the closing of the purchase of the shares upon which generali and/or mediobanca shall have exercised the right of first refusal shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date on which olimpia has received the relevant notice of exercise. it is hereby understood that generali and/or mediobanca shall not be entitled to exercise their right of first refusal where olimpia shall have obtained that the third party purchaser/s commit to purchase, in addition to the telecom shares held by olimpia, also the telecom shares tied-up to this agreement by generali and/or mediobanca at the same terms and conditions offered to olimpia. if such event, generali and/or mediobanca shall be free to elect whether to transfer the telecom shares tied-up by same to this agreement to the third party purchaser/s, at the conditions determined in the offer of the third party purchaser/s, or rather to refuse 3 the offer thus determining the final forfeiture of their right of first refusal. the decision to accept or rather refuse the offer shall be notified by generali and/or mediobanca to olimpia through registered mail to be received by olimpia within the term indicated by the latter in the notice communicating the offer of the third party purchaser/s, which term shall never be less than fifteen (15) days. in the case of lack of exercise of the right of first refusal or of its forfeiture, or in the case of non performance of the obligation to purchase the shares on which the right of first refusal has been exercised by them (and save in the latter case for the right of olimpia to compensation for any damages), olimpia shall be free to sell its interest to the third party purchaser/s at the conditions determined in the offer. in case of transfer of the interest of olimpia to generali and/or mediobanca, or rather to the third party purchaser/s, this agreement shall be deemed terminated as from the date of the relevant transfer. 7. except for what is provided for under article 6 with respect to the possible transfer and subsequent repurchase of telecom shares within the limit of 20% of the shares tied-up to this agreement, each of generali and mediobanca shall be entitled to purchase, directly or indirectly, additional telecom shares (which shall also be tied-up to this agreement for the period during which they are owned) exclusively up to a maximum of 25% of the telecom shares tied-up to this agreement by each of them as per whereas b, and provided further that this does not result in exceeding the relevant thresholds under mandatory tender offer statute as applicable from time to time. for the calculation of the aforesaid 25% limit, the telecom shares owned by mediobanca and generali on the date of execution of this agreement and not tied-up to same shall be accounted for. any purchase of telecom shares by any of the parties shall be previously communicated to the board and to the parties, whereas any transfer shall be promptly notified to the board and to the parties. on the date of execution of this agreement each party shall communicate to the board and to the other parties the amount of telecom shares owned and not tied-up, or which may be purchased pursuant to its own initiative, by virtue of option, conversion or other kind of rights. 8. this agreement shall be effective as from the date of execution and shall remain in force for a period of three (3) years, and therefore until 18 october 2009 (the "three-year term"). starting from the expiring of the three-year term this agreement shall be deemed to be tacitly renewed by three (3) further years and thereafter, unless any party has previously delivered to the other parties a notice of termination with three (3) months of notice. 9. should any third parties offer to enter into olimpia share capital by way of contribution in kind of an interest in telecom, which where added to the interest of the parties would take the aggregate interest to exceed the threshold provided for the triggering of a mandatory tender offer, olimpia shall promptly consult with generali and mediobanca, which shall be entitled to either (i) enter into olimpia share capital by way of contribution in kind of their telecom shares at the same conditions offered by the third party, or rather (ii) reduce their interest at a level so as to avoid that the threshold for the mandatory tender offer is passed. should generali and mediobanca do not confirm their commitment to do any of the actions provided for under (i) and (ii) within the reasonable term indicated by olimpia, then olimpia shall be entitled to accept the offer of the third parties, and from the date of acceptance of the offer this agreement shall be terminated. 10. no amendments of this agreement shall be effective without the previous unanimous writing approval of all the parties. 11. all notices to be made pursuant to this agreement
