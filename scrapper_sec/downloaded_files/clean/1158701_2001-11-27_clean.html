(c) on april 23, 2001, old kookmin and h&cb entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which the two banks agreed to merge by combining into a new corporation to be named "kookmin bank" referred to herein as the company. on november 1, 2001, this agreed upon merger was completed. on september 4, 2001, old kookmin and gs koryo lp entered into an agreement (the "amended investment agreement") to amend and restate the investment agreement to eliminate those provisions that would no longer be applicable after the completion of the merger. in addition, at or about the date of the merger, the company and the bank of new york, as trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture (the "supplemental indenture") confirming the assumption by the company of the obligations of old kookmin under the indenture. we understand from korean counsel that this assumption occurred in connection with the merger by operation of law. as a result of the merger, (a) holders of old kookmin common stock received one share of common stock of the company for every 1.688346 shares of common stock they owned in old kookmin, and holders of old kookmin global depositary shares received one american depositary share of the company for every 1.688346 global depositary shares they owned; and (b) holders of h&cb common stock received one share of common stock of the company for every share of common stock of h&cb they owned, and holders of h&cb american depositary shares received one american depositary share of the company for every two american depositary shares they owned. accordingly, gs chosun, received 19,553,663 shares of common stock of the company for the shares of common stock of old kookmin that gs chosun, held prior to the merger, and the convertible bonds held by gs shilla, became convertible into 10,046,347 shares of common stock of the company. except as described elsewhere in this schedule 13d, no transactions in the shares of common stock were effected by the filing persons, or, to their knowledge, any of the persons listed on schedules i though v hereto, during the past sixty days. (d) except for clients of gs asia or its affiliated broker-dealers who may have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, any shares of common stock, no other person is known by any filing person to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, shares of common stock beneficially owned by any filing person. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understanding or relationships with respect to securities of the company. certain contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships among the filing persons in connection with the amended investment agreement are described in item 3 and item 5 above. such descriptions are incorporated by reference into this item 6. the filing persons' interest in the convertible bonds is subject to the terms of the indenture and the indenture side letter, which are attached as exhibit 3 hereto and are incorporated by reference herein. gs shilla, has the right to convert its convertible bonds (or any portion thereof being u.s.$5,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) into shares of common stock of the company at any time until one month prior to june 14, 2005, the maturity date of the convertible bonds. as indicated above, at the current conversion price, the convertible bonds would be converted into 10,046,347 shares of common stock if converted at this time. the conversion price may be adjusted in certain events, including mergers and issuances of additional shares of common stock. they bear interest at the rate of 3.00 per cent per annum and may be redeemed in whole or in part for certain tax reasons prior to their maturity date. pursuant to the indenture side letter, in the event that the company intends to redeem outstanding convertible bonds in the event of changes in korean taxes, a holder of convertible bonds may elect to retain its convertible bonds if it waives its right to receive, in respect of its convertible bonds, such additional payments in respect of korean taxes as would result in the payment to such holder of the amounts of principal, premium (if any) and interest that would otherwise have been receivable by such holder in respect of payments of its convertible bonds in the absence of the applicable deduction or withholding. the supplemental indenture confirms the assumptions by the company of old kookmin's rights and obligations under the indenture. except as set forth in this statement, none of the filing persons or, to the knowledge of the filing persons, any of the persons listed on schedules i through v hereto is a party to any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with respect to any securities of the company. item 7. material to be filed as

(b) if the managing underwriter(s), if any, of an offering related to the bank registration determines in its reasonable judgment that marketing factors require a limitation of the number or principal amount of securities that can be included in such offering, the managing underwriter(s) may exclude the appropriate number or principal amount of securities held by the securityholders of the bank, including the purchaser, from such registration. if the managing underwriter(s) determines to exclude from such offering any registrable securities that the purchaser desires to include, or any securities that other bank securityholders with applicable registration rights desire to include, the purchaser and such other bank securityholders, if any (except for such person or persons, if any, upon whose demand such registration is being made) shall share pro rata in the portion of such offering available to them (the "available portion"). such pro rata allocation of the available portion between the gs investors, on the one hand, and such other bank securityholders, on the other hand, shall be based on the relation between the aggregate number of shares of common stock and shares underlying convertible securities that are registrable securities of the gs investors, on the one hand, and the aggregate number of shares of common stock and shares underlying convertible securities that such bank securityholders with applicable registration rights are entitled to include, on the other hand.

delivery of this indenture, the bank may deliver certificates executed by the bank to the trustee, in its capacity as registrar, for authentication, together with a company order for the authentication and delivery of such certificates; and the registrar, in accordance with such company order and the agency agreement shall authenticate and deliver, or cause to be authenticated or

authenticated and delivered hereunder. section 304. temporary bonds. pending the preparation of definitive certificates of bonds, the bank may execute, and upon company order the registrar shall authenticate and deliver, temporary certificates of bonds which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive certificates of bonds in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such bonds may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such bonds. if temporary certificates of bonds are issued, the bank will cause definitive certificates of bonds to be prepared without unreasonable delay. after the preparation of definitive certificates of bonds, the temporary certificates of bonds shall be exchangeable for definitive certificates of bonds upon surrender of the temporary certificates of bonds at any office or agency of the bank designated pursuant to section 1002, without charge to the holder. upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary certificates of bonds the bank shall execute and the registrar shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive certificates of bonds of authorized denominations. until so exchanged the temporary bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this indenture as definitive certificates of bonds. upon any exchange of a portion of a temporary certificate of a global bond for a definitive certificate of a global bond or for the definitive certificate of an individual bond represented thereby pursuant to this section 304 or section 305, the temporary global bond shall be endorsed by or on behalf of the trustee or the registrar to reflect the reduction of the principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon the principal amount of such temporary global bond shall

the trustee a register (the "bond register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the bank shall provide for the registration of bonds and of transfers of bonds. in accordance with the agency agreement, the trustee shall be the registrar for the purpose of registering bonds and transfers of bonds as herein provided. each bond and each certificate will have an identifying number which will be recorded on the relevant certificate and in the bond register. all transfers of bonds and entries on the bond register shall be made subject to the regulations concerning transfer of bonds provided in the agency agreement. the regulations may be changed by the bank with the prior written approval of the trustee in its own capacity and in its capacity as registrar. a copy of the current regulations will be mailed by the registrar to any holder upon request. the registrar and any transfer agent may decline to effect any exchange or transfer of a bond (i) during the period of 15 days ending on (and including) the due date for any payment of principal of or premium (if any) on, such bond or (ii) in respect of which a conversion notice has been delivered in accordance with section 1302(a). upon surrender for registration of transfer of any certificate at an office or agency of the bank designated pursuant to section 1002 for such purpose, the bank shall execute, and the registrar shall authenticate and deliver or cause to be delivered at the specified office of the trustee or any transfer agent, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new certificates of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount. each new certificate to be issued on transfer of bonds shall, within three business days at the place of the specified office of receipt by the registrar or the relevant transfer agent of the form of transfer, be mailed at the risk of the holder entitled to the bonds to the address specified in the form of transfer. where some but not all the bonds in respect of which a certificate is issued are to be transferred or converted, a new certificate in respect of the bonds not so transferred or converted shall, within three business days at the place of the specified office of deposit or surrender of the original certificate with or to the registrar or the relevant transfer agent, conversion agent or paying agent, be mailed at the risk of the holder of the bonds not so transferred or converted to the address of such holder appearing on the bond register. notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless and until a global bond is exchanged in whole or in part for the individual bonds represented thereby as provided herein, a global bond representing all or a portion of the bonds may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by such depositary or any such nominee to a successor depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary. the depositary must, at all times while it serves as such depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act and any other applicable statute or regulation. if the holder of a beneficial interest in the restricted global bond or the regulation s global bond (as the case may be) wishes at any time to exchange such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest thereafter to be represented by the regulation s global bond or the restricted global bond (as the case may be), or to transfer such beneficial interest to a person who wishes to have such beneficial interest thereafter represented by the regulation s global bond or the restricted global bond (as the case may be), such holder, subject to the rules and procedures of the depositary, euroclear and cedelbank, and subject to the provisions of the agency agreement, may so exchange or transfer (or cause such exchange or transfer of) such beneficial interest. upon receipt of a notice from dtc of (i) the exchange of a beneficial interest in a global bond, (ii) the redemption of a global bond as provided in article eleven or (iii) the exercise by a holder of the conversion right in respect of all or a portion of a global bond as provided in article thirteen, the registrar shall instruct dtc to endorse the restricted global bond or the regulation s global bond (as the case may be) to reflect the increase or reduction of the principal amount of the restricted global bond or the regulation s global bond (as the case may be). at the option of the holder, certificates may be exchanged for other certificates of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the certificates to be exchanged at such office or agency. whenever any certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the bank shall execute, and the registrar shall authenticate and deliver, the certificates which the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. if at any time the depositary notifies the bank that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if at any time the depositary shall no longer be eligible under this section 305, the bank shall appoint a successor depositary. if (i) a successor depositary is not appointed by the bank within 90 days after the bank receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, or (ii) at any time any of the bonds become due and payable in accordance with article five, the bank will execute, and the registrar, upon receipt of a company order for the authentication and delivery of certificates of individual definitive bonds, will authenticate and deliver, certificates in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the global bond or bonds representing the bonds in exchange for such global bond or bonds. the depositary may surrender all global bonds then outstanding and registered in the name of the depositary or the nominee of the depositary in exchange in whole or in part for certificates of individual definitive bonds on such terms as are acceptable to the bank and such depositary. thereupon, the bank shall execute, and the registrar shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, to each person specified by such depositary certificates of any authorized denomination as requested by such person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such person's beneficial interest in a global bond. upon the exchange of a global bond in whole for certificates of individual definitive bonds, such global bond shall be canceled by the trustee. certificates issued in exchange for all or any portion of a global bond pursuant to this section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the depositary for such global bond, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the trustee. the trustee and the bank shall not have any liability for the accuracy of the instructions received from the depositary. the trustee shall deliver such bonds to the persons in whose names such bonds are so registered. all certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of certificates shall be the valid obligations of the bank, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this indenture, as the certificates surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. every certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the bank or the trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the bank and the registrar duly executed, by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. a bond may be transferred by delivering the certificate issued in respect of such bond accompanied by, or, in the case of a bond represented by a global bond, delivery of, a form of transfer duly completed and signed, to the specified office of the registrar or any of the transfer agents appointed pursuant to the agency agreement. no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds, but the bank or any transfer agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds. neither the bank nor the trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any participant in the depositary, any person claiming a beneficial ownership interest in the bonds under or through the depositary or any such participant, or any other person which is not shown on the bond register as being a holder with respect to (1) the bonds; (2) the accuracy of any records maintained by the depositary or any such participant; (3) the payment by the depositary or any such participant of any amount in respect of the principal of or premium or interest on the bonds or the conversion of the bonds; (4) any notice which is permitted or required to be given to holders of bonds under this indenture; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by the depositary as holder of bonds. section 306. mutilated, destroyed, lost and stolen certificates. if any mutilated certificate is surrendered to the trustee, upon payment to the trustee of such costs as may be incurred in connection with the replacement of any such certificate, the bank shall execute and the registrar shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new certificate of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. if there shall be delivered to the bank and the trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any certificate (ii) such costs as may be incurred in connection with the replacement of any such certificate and (iii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the bank or the trustee that such certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the bank shall execute and the trustee as registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen certificate, a new certificate of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen certificate has become or is about to become due and payable, the bank in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new certificate, pay such bond. upon the issuance of any new certificate under this section, the bank may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the trustee) connected therewith. every new certificate issued pursuant to this section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the bank, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other bonds duly issued hereunder. any new certificate issued pursuant to this section shall be available for delivery at the specified office of the registrar and at the specified office of any paying agent including, so long as the bonds are listed on the london stock exchange (or the luxembourg stock exchange) by the bank, at the specified london (or luxembourg) office of the paying agent. the provisions of this section 306 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen certificates. section 307. payment of interest; interest rights preserved. interest on any bond which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid in the manner contemplated in section 301 to the person in whose name that bond (or one or more predecessor bonds) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest. any interest on any bond which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any interest payment date (herein called "defaulted interest"), to the extent permitted by law and subject to section 112, shall accrue interest at the rate then borne by the bonds until such defaulted interest is paid or duly provided for as provided herein but shall forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been such holder, and such defaulted interest may be paid by the bank, subject to the provisions of article five and at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) the bank may elect to make payment of any defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) to the persons in whose names the bonds (or their respective predecessor bonds) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. the bank shall notify the trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) proposed to be paid on each bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the bank shall deposit with the trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such defaulted interest as in this clause provided. thereupon the trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. the trustee shall promptly notify the bank of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the bank, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed to the holders shown on the bond register not more than 5 days prior to the date of such mailing, in accordance with section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor having been so given, such defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) shall be paid to the persons in whose names the bonds (or their respective predecessor bonds) are registered at the close of business on such special record date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) the bank may make payment of any defaulted interest (together with any interest accrued thereon) in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the bonds may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the bank to the trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the trustee. holders shall not, however, be entitled to any interest or other payment for any delay after the due date in receiving the amount due (i) if the due date is not a business day in new york city or, in the case of the surrender of a certificate, in the place where the certificate is surrendered (provided the amount is duly provided for on or before the due date), (ii) if the holder is late in surrendering the certificate (where such surrender is required pursuant to this indenture) or (iii) if a check mailed in accordance with the provisions of this indenture arrives after the due date for payment. subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, each certificate delivered under this indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other certificate shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other certificate. section 308. additional amounts. all payments by the bank in respect of the bonds shall be made after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of korea or by or within any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein having power to tax ("korean taxes"). the bank shall pay such additional amounts ("additional amounts") in respect of korean taxes as will result in the payment to holders of the bonds of the amounts of principal, premium (if any) and interest that would otherwise have been receivable by them in respect of payments on such bonds in the absence of such deduction or withholding, except that no such additional amounts shall be payable in respect of any bond: (i) to or on behalf of a holder or beneficial owner who is subject to such korean taxes in respect of such bond by reason of the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner and korea otherwise than merely by holding or beneficially owning such bond or by the receipt of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of any bond; (ii) to or on behalf of a holder or beneficial owner to the extent that such holder or beneficial owner would not be liable for or subject to such deduction or withholding by making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption or reduction to the relevant tax authorities if such holder or beneficial owner is eligible to make such declaration or other claim and, after having been requested to make such a declaration or claim, such holder or beneficial owner fails to do so; or (iii) in circumstances where the surrender of a bond is required hereunder, if the certificate in respect of such bond is surrendered more than 30 days after the relevant date except to the extent that the holder thereof would have been entitled to such additional amount on presenting the same for payment on the last day of such 30-day period. for this purpose the "relevant date" in relation to any bond means (a) the due date for payment in respect thereof or (b) if the full amount of the monies payable on such due date has not been received in new york city by the trustee or the principal paying agent on or prior to such due date the date on which notice is duly given to the holders that such monies have been so received. additionally, the obligation of the bank to pay such additional amounts shall not apply with respect to (i) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges or (ii) any taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments on the bonds. the bank shall provide the trustee with documentation evidencing the payment of such korean taxes. copies of such documentation will be made available to any holder or any paying agent, as applicable, upon request therefor. in the event that additional amounts actually paid with respect to the bonds are based on rates of deduction or withholding in excess of the appropriate rate applicable to the holder of such bonds, and, as a result thereof, such holder is entitled to make a claim for a refund or credit of such excess, then such holder shall, by accepting the bonds, be deemed to have assigned and transferred all right, title and interest to any such claim for a refund or credit of such excess to the bank. however, by making such assignment, the holder makes no representation or warranty that the bank will be entitled to receive such claim for a refund or credit and incurs no other obligation with respect thereto (including, without limitation, executing any other instrument of transfer or incurring any expense in connection with this transfer). references in this indenture to principal, premium (if any) and interest shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this section or any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto or in substitution therefor pursuant to this indenture. at least 10 business days in new york city prior to the first interest payment date or principal payment date (and at least 10 business days in new york city prior to each succeeding interest payment date or principal payment date if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned officer's certificate) the bank shall furnish to the trustee and the paying agents an officer's certificate instructing the trustee and the paying agents whether payments of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on the bonds due on such interest payment date or principal payment date shall be subject to deduction or withholding for or on account of any korean taxes and the rate of any such deduction or withholding. if any such deduction or withholding shall be required, prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date, as the case may be, the bank shall furnish the trustee and the paying agents an officer's certificate which specifies the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payment to holders and the additional amounts due to holders and which certifies that the bank shall pay such withholding or deduction to the appropriate governmental authorities and shall pay to the trustee or the paying agents such additional amounts. the bank covenants to indemnify the trustee for, and to hold the trustee harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the trustee's part, arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by the trustee in reliance on any officer's certificate furnished pursuant to this paragraph or the failure of the bank to provide any such certificate. any officer's certificate required by this section 308 to be provided to the trustee and any paying agent shall be deemed to be duly provided if telecopied to the trustee and such paying agent. section 309. persons deemed owners. the bonds shall be registered instruments, title to which shall pass only by registration in the bond register. prior to due presentment of a certificate for registration of transfer, the bank, the trustee and any agent of the bank or the trustee may treat the person in whose name such certificate is registered as the owner of the bond represented by such certificate for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium (if any) and (subject to section 307) interest on such bond and, other than for the purpose of exercising a conversion right so long as such certificate is a global bond certificate, for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such bond is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any interest or any writing on, or the theft or loss of the certificate issued in respect of it, and neither the bank, the trustee nor any agent of the bank or the trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. section 310. cancellation. all certificates surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion shall, if surrendered to any person other than the trustee, be delivered to the trustee as registrar and shall be promptly canceled by it. the bank may at any time deliver to the trustee for cancellation any certificates previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the bank may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all certificates so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the trustee. no certificates shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any certificates canceled as provided in this section, except as expressly permitted by this indenture. all canceled certificates held by the trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a company order; provided, however, that the trustee shall not be required to destroy such canceled certificates. section 311. computation of interest. interest on the bonds shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed. article four satisfaction and discharge section 401. satisfaction and discharge of indenture. this indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of conversion, registration of transfer or exchange of bonds and any other provisions herein expressly provided for), and the trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the bank, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this indenture, when (1) either (a) all certificates theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than certificates (i) which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in section 306 and (ii) issued in respect of bonds for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the bank and thereafter repaid to the bank or discharged from such trust, as provided in section 1003) have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or (b) all such bonds in respect of which certificates not theretofore delivered to the trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year, and the bank, in the case of (i) or (ii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such bonds not theretofore delivered to the trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium (if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of bonds which have become due and payable) or to the maturity date, as the case may be; and (2) the bank has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the bank; and (3) the bank has delivered to the trustee an officer's certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this indenture have been complied with. notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this indenture, the obligations of the bank to the trustee under section 606, the obligations of the trustee to any authenticating agent under section 611 and, if money shall have been deposited with the trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this section, the obligations of the trustee under section 402 and the last paragraph of section 1003 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge. section 402. application of trust money. subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of section 1003, all money deposited with the trustee pursuant to section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the bonds and this indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including the bank acting as its own paying agent) as the trustee may determine, to the persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium (if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the trustee. all moneys deposited with the trustee pursuant to section 401 (and held by it or any paying agent) for the payment of bonds or portions thereof subsequently converted shall be returned promptly to the bank upon company request. article five remedies section 501. events of default. "event of default", wherever used herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such event of default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) a default is made for more than 14 days in the payment of the principal or premium (if any) or default is made for more than 21 days in the payment of interest in respect of any of the bonds when and as the same ought to be paid in accordance with the terms of this indenture; or (2) a default is made by the bank in the performance or observance of any covenant, condition or provision contained in this indenture or in the bonds and on its part to be performed or observed (other than the covenant to pay the principal, premium (if any) and interest in respect of any of the bonds) and such default continues for the period of 30 days next following the service given by registered or certified mail by the trustee on the bank of notice requiring such default to be remedied (unless the trustee certifies in writing that, in its opinion, such default is not capable of remedy, in which case no such notice shall be required); or (3) a default is made or exists under any other bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness for money borrowed (collectively, the "indebtedness") having an aggregate principal amount of u.s.$10,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) or more of the bank, which default shall have resulted in such indebtedness becoming, or being declared, due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise be due and payable, without such indebtedness having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, or the bank defaults in the repayment of any such indebtedness at the maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of any applicable grace period therefor or any guarantee of or indemnity in respect of any indebtedness of others given by the bank shall not be honored when due and called upon; or (4) a subordination event shall have occurred. section 502. limited rights of acceleration; effect of default. if an event of default specified in section 501(4) above shall occur and be continuing, the maturity of all outstanding bonds shall automatically be accelerated and the principal amount of the bonds, together with accrued interest and any unpaid additional amounts thereon, shall be immediately due and payable in cash, and (except as set forth below) the only remedy available in respect of such acceleration will be the ability to petition for the liquidation of, or for the commencement of reorganization proceedings in relation to, the bank in korea (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant requirements of applicable law) and to prove its claims in the liquidation or other applicable proceedings in respect of the bank in korea. there is no right of acceleration of the payment of principal of the bonds upon the occurrence of any other event of default or a default in the performance of any other covenant or agreement contained in the bonds. if any other event of default shall occur and be continuing, the trustee or a holder of the bonds (in the case of the event of default specified in section 501(1) above) may petition for the liquidation of, or for the commencement of reorganization proceedings in relation to, the bank in korea (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant requirements of applicable law) and seek to prove its claims in the liquidation or other applicable proceedings or (in the case of an event of default specified in section 501(2) or section 501(3)) may seek performance of such covenant or agreement or have a cause of action against the bank for money damages. notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if there is a change in any applicable law, regulation or directive (including the fsc regulations and guidelines relating to the capital adequacy ratio of banks) or in its interpretation or application by any administrative or governmental body charged with its administration which, after the date of this indenture, permits a lender or a bondholder, in the event of a default other than a subordination event, to accelerate, and to exercise other applicable remedies in respect of, any part of such lender's or bondholder's subordinated loans or bonds which have ceased to qualify as tier ii capital without disqualifying those portions of such subordinated loans or bonds which are then treated as tier ii capital, then such change shall apply to the trustee with respect to the bonds and, if an event of default then occurs and is continuing, the trustee may accelerate the payment of the principal of that portion of the bonds that no longer qualifies as tier ii capital. section 503. trustee may file proofs of claim. in case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the bank or any other obligor upon the bonds or the property of the bank or such other obligor or their creditors, the trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the bonds shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the trustee shall have made any demand on the bank for the payment of overdue principal, premium (if any) or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium (if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the bonds and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the trustee, its agents and counsel) and the holders of bonds allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each holder of bonds to make such payments to the trustee and, in the event that the trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the holders of bonds, to pay to the trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the trustee under section 606. no provision of this indenture shall be deemed to authorize the trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the bonds or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any holder in any such proceeding. section 504. trustee may enforce claims without possession of bonds. all rights of action and claims under this indenture or the bonds may be prosecuted and enforced by the trustee without the possession of any of the bonds or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the bonds in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. section 505. application of money or other property collected. any money or other property collected by the trustee pursuant to this article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or other property on account of principal, premium (if any) or interest, upon presentation of the bonds and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: first: to the payment of all amounts due the trustee under section 606; second: to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of, premium (if any) and interest on the bonds in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such bonds for principal, premium (if any) and interest, respectively; and third: in payment of the balance (if any) to the bank for itself. without prejudice to the foregoing, if the trustee holds any moneys which represent principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of bonds in respect of which claims have become prescribed under section 1003, the trustee will hold such moneys upon the first and third trusts described above. section 506. limitation on suits. no holder of any bond shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such holder has previously given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default; (2) the holders of not less than one-third in principal amount of the outstanding bonds shall have made written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default in its own name as trustee hereunder and, in the case of any such event of default other than those described in (1) and (4) of section 501, certified that such event of default is materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders; (3) such holder or holders have offered to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds; it being understood and intended that no one or more holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other holders or to enforce any right under this indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the holders. section 507. unconditional right of holders to receive principal, premium (if any) and interest and to convert. notwithstanding any other provision in this indenture, the holder of any bond shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and (subject to section 307) interest on such bond on the respective maturity date or interest payment dates expressed in such bond and to convert such bond in accordance with article thirteen and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such holder. section 508. restoration of rights and remedies. if the trustee or any holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the trustee or to such holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the bank, the trustee and the holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the trustee and the holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. section 509. rights and remedies cumulative. except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen certificates in the last paragraph of section 306 or as provided in section 506, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the trustee or to the holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. except as described above, the assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. section 510. delay or omission not waiver. no delay or omission of the trustee or of any holder of any bond to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any event of default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such event of default or an acquiescence therein. every right and remedy given by this article or by law to the trustee or to the holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the trustee or by the holders, as the case may be. section 511. control by holders. the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds shall have the right, subject to section 602(e), to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this indenture, (2) the trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and (3) such direction shall not be unduly prejudicial to non-directing holders of bonds. section 512. waiver of past defaults. the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds may on behalf of the holders of all the bonds waive any past default or event of default hereunder and its consequences, except a default or event of default (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any bond, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under article nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding bond affected. upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. section 513. undertaking for costs. all parties to this indenture agree, and each holder of any bond by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this indenture, or in any suit against the trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the bank, to any suit instituted by the trustee, to any suit instituted by any holder, or group of holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10 percent in principal amount of the outstanding bonds, or to any suit instituted by any holder of any bond for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any bond on or after the respective maturity date or interest payment date expressed in such bond or for the enforcement of the right to convert any bond in accordance with article thirteen. section 514. waiver of stay or extension laws. the bank covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, nor at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this indenture; and the bank (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. article six the trustee section 601. certain duties and responsibilities. except during the continuance of an event of default, (1) the trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this indenture against the trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the trustee and conforming to the requirements of this indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the trustee, the trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this indenture. in case an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. no provision of this indenture shall be construed to relieve the trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that (1) the trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer, responsible officers or trust committee; (2) the trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the

the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee, under this indenture; and (3) no provision of this indenture shall require the trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this section. the permissive right of the trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the indenture shall not be construed as a duty. section 602. certain rights of trustee.

(c) equivalent proceedings outside korea. if on or prior to the maturity date a foreign event occurs and so long as it continues, any amounts which become due then or thereafter under the bonds shall only become payable upon conditions equivalent to those enumerated in clause (a) or (b) above having been fulfilled, provided that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the imposition of any such conditions is not allowed under such proceedings, any amounts which become due under the bonds shall become payable in accordance with the terms herein provided and not subject to such conditions. section 1202. excess payment. each holder of a bond, by its acceptance thereof or its interest therein, agrees that (i) if any payment in respect of such bond is made to such holder after the occurrence of a subordination event and the amount of such payment shall exceed the amount, if any, that should have been paid to such holder upon the proper application of these subordination provisions, the payment of such excess amount shall be deemed null and void and such holder (without any agent having any obligation or liability with respect thereto, save to the extent that the registrar and any other agent shall return to the bank any such excess amount which remains held by it at that time of the notice next referred to) shall be obliged to return the amount of the excess payment within ten days of receiving notice from the bank of the excess payment and (ii) upon the occurrence of a subordination event and, so long as such subordination event continues, such holder shall not exercise any right to set off any liabilities of the bank under such bond (except in respect of liabilities constituting senior indebtedness of the bank) which become so payable on or after the date on which the subordination event occurs against any liabilities of such holder owed to the bank unless, until and only in such amounts as the liabilities of the bank under such bond become payable pursuant to the proper application of these subordination provisions. section 1203. absence of subordination event. prior to the occurrence of a subordination event or after a subordination event shall have ceased to continue, the bonds will rank pari passu and ratably without any preference among themselves and with all unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the bank, including those in respect of its outstanding debentures and deposits, but excluding obligations in respect of national and local taxes in korea (and elsewhere as applicable) and other statutory exceptions. section 1204. incurrence of additional subordinated indebtedness. for so long as any bonds remain outstanding, the bank shall not incur any indebtedness which is not subordinate to the same extent as the bonds and which is, at the time it is incurred, treated as capital of the bank under applicable fsc regulations and guidelines, unless provision is made such that the bonds will thereafter be subordinated on terms no less favorable to the holders than such indebtedness; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply (i) to indebtedness the percentage of the principal amount of which will be treated as capital of the bank under applicable fsc regulations and guidelines is less than the percentage of the principal amount of the bonds that was treated as capital of the bank at the time of their issuance or (ii) in the event that such change in subordination terms would result in the bonds or such additional subordinated indebtedness not being treated as capital of the bank. article thirteen conversion of bonds section 1301. conversion right and conversion price. (a) conversion period. subject to, and upon compliance with, the provisions of this article, the conversion right in respect of any outstanding bond (or any portion thereof being u.s.$5,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) may be exercised, at the option of the holder thereof or, with respect to any bonds represented by a global bond, through the holder thereof by any person owning a beneficial interest therein, at any time during the conversion period. (b) conversion ratio. the number of conversion shares to be issued on conversion of a bond will be determined by dividing the principal amount of the bond to be converted (translated into won at the exchange rate (maemaegijunyul) between the u.s. dollars and korean won as announced by the korean financial telecommunications & clearing institute at the close of business of june 14, 1999, seoul time, to be applicable as the basic rate for the open of business of june 15, 1999, seoul time) by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. (c) fractions of conversion shares. if more than one bond is deposited for conversion at any one time by the same holder and with the same conversion agent and in circumstances where the conversion shares issuable on conversion of the bonds are to be registered in the same name(s), the number of conversion shares to be issued on conversion of the bonds will be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of bonds to be converted. fractions of conversion shares will not be issued on conversion and no cash adjustments will be made in respect of any such fraction. however, in the event there is a consolidation or reclassification of shares by operation of law or otherwise occurring after the closing date that reduces the number of shares outstanding, the bank shall pay in cash the portion of the principal amount of the bond or bonds to be converted that corresponds to any fraction of a conversion share not issued, if such portion of such principal amount exceeds u.s.$10.00. (d) conversion price. the price at which bonds may be converted into conversion shares shall initially be won 14,200 per share, as adjusted in the manner provided in this indenture (the "conversion price"). section 1302. conversion procedures. (a) conversion notice. to exercise the conversion right attaching to any bond, the holder or, with respect to any bonds represented by a global bond, any person owning a beneficial interest therein must complete, execute and deposit at such holder's or beneficial owner's own expense during the conversion period during normal business hours on any business day in the place at the specified office of any conversion agent a notice of conversion substantially in the form set forth in section 205 (a "conversion notice") in duplicate, which form shall be obtainable from the specified office of each conversion agent, together with the relevant certificate (other than a global bond certificate) and must pay any amount required to be paid by the holder or beneficial owner pursuant to section 1302(b). (b) taxes and duties. a converting holder or beneficial owner of bonds must pay to the applicable conversion agent all stamp, issue, registration, excise or similar taxes or duties or transfer costs (if any) arising in connection with the conversion of a bond in the country of the conversion agent with which the conversion notice and certificate is deposited, or payable in any jurisdiction (other than korea) consequent upon the issue or delivery of conversion shares or any other securities, property or cash before the bank shall be obliged to issue or deliver the same. the bank will pay all other expenses (including all stamp, issue, registration, excise or similar taxes or duties or transfer costs payable in korea) arising solely on the conversion of bonds and the issue of conversion shares pursuant thereto (including the charges of any agent or the registrar). a certificate and/or conversion notice deposited with a conversion agent outside normal business hours or on a day which is not a business day at the place of the specified office of such conversion agent shall for all purposes be deemed to have been deposited with such conversion agent during normal business hours on the next such business day. once deposited, a conversion notice and the relevant certificate or certificates in respect of which conversion rights are exercised may not be withdrawn without consent in writing of the bank. (c) registration and delivery of shares. with effect from the conversion date, the bank will deem the converting holder to have become the holder of record of the number of conversion shares to be issued on such conversion (disregarding any retroactive adjustment of the conversion price referred to below prior to the time such retroactive adjustment shall have become effective). thereafter the bank will, subject to any applicable limitations then imposed by korean laws and regulations, according to the request made in the relevant conversion notice, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 21 days after the conversion date, (i) deliver or cause to be delivered to the order of the person named for that purpose in the relevant conversion notice or make available or cause to be made available at the specified office in seoul for the time being of the bank a certificate or certificates for the relevant conversion shares registered in the name of the converting holder or, in cases permitted under korean law, any other person specified for that purpose in the relevant conversion notice, together with any other securities, property or cash required to be delivered upon conversion and such assignments and other documents (if any) as may be required by law to effect the delivery thereof, or (ii) register korea securities depository (or its successor organization) as holder of the relevant number of conversion shares in the bank's shareholders' register and cause korea securities depository (or its successor organization) to credit such conversion shares to the deposit account of the custodian designated by the converting holder in the relevant conversion notice and to deliver or cause to be delivered to the order of the converting holder at such specified office of the bank any such other securities, property, cash, assignments and documents. the bank shall not close its register of shareholders unless, under korean law as then in effect, bonds may be converted legally and the conversion shares issued upon conversion thereof may be transferred at all times during the period of such closure. bonds, the conversion right of which has been duly exercised and discharged, shall be canceled and the holder's name shall be removed from the bond register on the relevant conversion date with respect to the conversion shares issued. (d) retroactive and other adjustments. if the conversion date in respect of any conversion shares issued upon the exercise of conversion rights pursuant to section 1301 shall be on or after a date on which an adjustment to the conversion price takes effect (retroactively or otherwise) pursuant to any of the provisions referred to in sections 1303 and 1307 and the conversion date in respect of such exercise falls on a date when such adjustment has not yet been reflected in the current conversion price, the bank shall procure that the provisions of section 1302(c) shall be applied, mutatis mutandis, to such number of conversion shares as is equal to the excess of the number of conversion shares which would have been required to be issued on conversion of such bonds if such adjustment had been given effect as at such conversion date over the number of conversion shares issuable on such conversion without otherwise having given effect to such adjustment. (e) dividends accrued. any dividend on the conversion shares issued on conversion of any bonds with respect to the dividend accrual period during which the relevant conversion date falls will be paid with respect to the full dividend accrual period on the basis that the conversion took effect at the beginning of such dividend accrual period. the conversion shares issued upon conversion of the bonds will in all other respects rank pari passu with the conversion shares outstanding on the relevant conversion date as if the conversion shares issued on conversion had been issued and outstanding on such date (except for any right the record date for which precedes such conversion date and any other right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable law). (f) interest accrued. no payment or adjustment will be made on conversion for any interest accrued on any converted bonds since the interest payment date last preceding the relevant conversion date, or if the bonds are converted before the first interest payment date, the closing date. section 1303. adjustment of conversion price. the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment as follows: (a) free distributions of shares, sub-divisions, consolidations and reclassifications. (i) if the bank shall (1) make a free distribution of shares, (2) sub-divide its outstanding shares, (3) consolidate its outstanding shares into a smaller number of shares, or (4) reclassify any of its shares into other securities of the bank, then the conversion price shall be appropriately adjusted so that the holder of any bond, the conversion date in respect of which occurs after the coming into effect of the adjustment described in this paragraph (a), shall be entitled to receive the number of shares and/or other securities of the bank which it would have held or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such bond been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event (or, if the bank has fixed a prior record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive any such free distribution of shares or other securities issued upon any such sub-division, consolidation or re-classification, immediately prior to such record date), but without prejudice to the effect of any other adjustment to the conversion price made with effect from the date of the happening of such event (or such record date) or at any time thereafter. (ii) an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall become effective immediately on the relevant event referred to above becoming effective or, if a record date is fixed therefor, immediately after such record date; provided that in the case of a free distribution of shares which must, under applicable korean law, be submitted for approval to a general meeting of shareholders or be approved by a meeting of the board of directors of the bank before being legally paid or made, and which is so approved after the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution, such adjustment shall, immediately after such approval being given by such meeting, become effective retroactively to immediately after such record date. (iii) the reclassification of shares into securities other than shares (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which section 1307 applies) shall be deemed to involve (1) a distribution of such securities other than shares to all holders of shares and (2) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares outstanding immediately thereafter. (iv) if the bank shall make a free distribution of shares, which distribution is to be made to shareholders of the bank as of a record date which is also: (1) the record date for the issue of any options, rights or warrants which requires an adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to paragraph (c) below; or (2) the day immediately prior to the date of issue of any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares or options, rights or warrants which requires an adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to paragraph (e) below, then (except where such distribution gives rise to a retroactive adjustment of the conversion price under (ii) of this paragraph (a)) no adjustment of the conversion price in respect of such distribution shall be made under this paragraph (a), but in lieu thereof an adjustment shall be made under paragraph (c) or (e) below (as the case may require) by including in the denominator of the fraction described therein the aggregate number of shares to be issued pursuant to such distribution. (b) share dividends. if the bank shall declare a dividend in shares, then the conversion price in effect on the date when such dividend is declared (or, if the bank has fixed a prior record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend, on such record date) shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: ncp = ocp x [(n + y) / (n + n)] where: ncp = the conversion price after such adjustment. ocp = the conversion price before adjustment. n = = the number of shares outstanding (having regard to paragraph (g) below) at the time of declaration of such dividend (or at the close of business in seoul on such record date, as the case may be). n = the number of shares to be distributed to the shareholders as a dividend. y = the number of shares which the aggregate par value of such shares to be distributed to the shareholders as a dividend, would purchase at the current market price per share (as defined in paragraph (h) below). such adjustment shall become effective as provided with respect to paragraph (a)(ii) above; provided, that in the case of a dividend in shares which must, under applicable korean law, be submitted for approval to a general meeting of shareholders or be approved by a meeting of the board of directors of the bank before being legally paid, and which is so approved after the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend, such adjustment shall, immediately after such approval being given by such meeting, become effective retroactively to immediately after such record date. if the bank shall declare and pay a dividend in shares, which dividend is to be paid or made to shareholders of the bank as of a record date which is also: (1) the record date for the issue of any options, rights or warrants which requires an adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to paragraph (c) below; or (2) the day immediately prior to the date of issue of any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares or options, rights or warrants which requires an adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to paragraph (e) below, then (except where such dividend gives rise to a retroactive adjustment of the conversion price under paragraph (a)(ii) above) no adjustment of the conversion price in respect of such dividend shall be made under this paragraph (b), but in lieu thereof an adjustment shall be made under paragraph (c) or (e) below (as the case may require) by including in the denominator of the fraction described therein the aggregate number of shares to be issued pursuant to such dividend and including in the numerator of the fraction described therein the number of shares which the aggregate par value of shares to be so distributed would purchase at the current market price per share (as defined in paragraph (h) below). (c) issues of options, rights or warrants to buy shares. if the bank shall grant, issue or offer to the holders of shares options, rights or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares or any securities that carry rights to subscribe for or purchase shares, at a consideration per share receivable by the bank (determined as provided in paragraph (f) below) which is fixed: (i) on or prior to the record date mentioned below and is less than the current market price per share (as defined in paragraph (h) below) at such record date; or (ii) after the record date mentioned below and is less than the current market price per share on the date the bank fixes the said consideration, (other than any such rights or warrants granted, issued or offered to and accepted by existing employees of the bank in accordance with mandatory provisions of korean law) then the conversion price in effect (in a case within (i) above) on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such options, rights or warrants or (in a case within (ii) above) on the date the bank fixes the said consideration shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: ncp = ocp x [(n + v) : (n + n)] where: ncp and ocp have the meanings ascribed thereto in paragraph (b) above and: n = the number of shares outstanding (having regard to paragraph (g) below) at the close of business in seoul (in a case within (i) above) on such record date or (in a case within (ii) above) on the date the bank fixes the said consideration. n = the number of shares initially to be issued upon exercise of such options, rights or warrants and/or conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities at the said consideration. v = the number of shares which the aggregate consideration receivable by the bank (determined as provided in paragraph (f) below) would purchase at such current market price per share specified in (i) or, as the case may be, (ii) above. such adjustment shall become effective (in a case within (i) above) immediately after the record date for the determination of holders of shares entitled to receive such options, rights or warrants or (in a case within (ii) above) immediately after the bank fixes the said consideration but retroactively to immediately after the record date for the said determination. if, in connection with a grant, issue or offer to the holders of shares of options, rights or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares, any such shares or any such securities which are not subscribed for or purchased by the persons entitled thereto are offered to and/or subscribed by others (whether as placees or members of the public or pursuant to underwriting agreements or otherwise), no further adjustments shall be required or made to the conversion price by reason of such offer and/or subscription and/or, as the case may be, the conversion or exchange of such securities.

(e) excess payment a bondholder by its acceptance thereof or its interest therein shall thereby agree that (i) if any payment in respect of such bond is made to such bondholder after the occurrence of a subordination event and the amount of such payment shall exceed the amount, if any, that should have been paid to such bondholder upon the proper application of these subordination provisions, the payment of such excess amount shall be deemed null and void and such bondholder (without any agent having any obligation or liability with respect thereto, except that the registrar shall return to the bank any such excess amount which remains held by it at that time of the notice next referred to) shall be obliged to return the amount of the excess payment within ten days of receiving notice from the bank of the excess payment and (ii) upon the occurrence of a subordination event and, so long as such subordination event continues, such bondholder shall not exercise any right to set off any liabilities of the bank under such bond (except in respect of liabilities constituting senior indebtedness of the bank) which become so payable on or after the date on which the subordination event occurs against any liabilities of such bondholder owed to the bank unless, until and only in such amount as the liabilities of the bank under such bond become payable pursuant to the proper application of these subordination provisions.

(b) delivery of new certificates: each new certificate to be issued on exchange or transfer of bonds will, within three business days of receipt by the registrar or the relevant transfer agent of the original certificate and the form of transfer, be mailed at the risk of the holder entitled to the bonds to the address specified in the form of transfer. where some but not all the bonds in respect of which a certificate is issued are to be exchanged, transferred, converted or redeemed, a new certificate in respect of the bonds not so exchanged, transferred, converted or redeemed will, within three business days of deposit or surrender of the original certificate with or to the registrar or the relevant transfer agent, conversion agent or paying agent, be mailed at the risk of the holder of the bonds not so exchanged, transferred, converted or redeemed to the address of such holder appearing on the bond register. (c) formalities free of charge: no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of bonds but the bank or any of the transfer agents may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed. (d) regulations: all transfers of bonds and entries on the bond register will be made subject to the detailed regulations concerning transfer of bonds attached as a schedule to the agency agreement. the regulations may be changed by the bank with the prior written approval of the trustee and the registrar. a copy of the current regulations will be mailed by the registrar to any bondholder upon request. 6. interest the bonds will bear interest from june 14, 1999 at the rate of 3.00 per cent. per annum. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 30 and december 31 in each year (each an "interest payment date"), except that (i) the first interest payment shall be made on december 31, 1999 (the "first interest payment date") in respect of the period from and including june 14, 1999 to but excluding december 31, 1999 and (ii) the last interest payment shall be made on the maturity date in respect of the period from and including december 31, 2004 to but excluding the maturity date. each bond will cease to bear interest (i) when such bond has been repaid or redeemed in accordance with these conditions; (ii) when the date for redemption with respect to such bond has occurred and redemption moneys and accrued interest with respect to such bond have been deposited with the trustee or a paying agent or have been segregated by the bank and held in trust; (iii) from the date that claims on such bond have been prescribed; (iv) with respect to the conversion of such bond in accordance with the provisions of condition 7, on the interest payment date last preceding the relevant conversion date, or if such bond was converted before the first interest payment date, june 14, 1999. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a bond is due for redemption or repayment and upon due presentation, payment of the principal and premium (if any) is withheld or refused or default is otherwise made in respect of any such payment, interest will continue to accrue at the rate aforesaid (both after as well as before any judgment) up to but excluding the date on which payment in full of the principal thereof and premium (if any) is made or (if earlier) the day after notice is duly given to the holder of such bond (in accordance with condition 15) that upon further presentation of such bond being duly made such payment will be made, provided that upon further presentation thereof being duly made such payment is in fact made. interest on the bonds will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed. 7. conversion (a)(i) conversion right and conversion period: bondholders will have the right to convert their bonds (or any portion thereof being u.s.$5,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) into conversion shares (as defined below) at any time during the conversion period referred to below. the right of a bondholder to convert any bond (or any such portion thereof) into conversion shares is called the "conversion right". subject to the discussion below, the conversion right in respect of any bond may be exercised, at the option of the registered holder thereof or, with respect to any bonds represented by a global bond, through the registered holder by any person owning a beneficial interest therein, at any time on and after the date that is one month following june 14, 1999 up to the close of business (at the place of the office of the conversion agent where the certificate (other than a certificate issued in respect of a global bond) representing such bond is deposited for conversion together with a conversion notice) on the date that is one month prior to the maturity date (or, if that is not a business day in seoul, on the immediately preceding business day, but in no event thereafter) or, if such bond shall have been called for redemption pursuant to condition 9(b) or condition 11 prior to such date, then up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date not later than 10 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (the "conversion period"). (ii) conversion price: the number of conversion shares to be issued upon conversion of a bond shall be determined by dividing the principal amount of the bond to be converted (translated into won at the exchange rate (maemaegijunyul) between the u.s. dollars and korean won as announced by the korean financial telecommunications & clearing institute at the close of business of june 14, 1999, seoul time, to be applicable as the basic rate for the open of business of june 15, 1999, seoul time) by the conversion price (as defined below) in effect at the conversion date (as defined below). the "conversion price" will initially be won 14,200 per share (as defined below) but will be subject to adjustment in certain events provided in paragraph (c) of this condition. if more than one bond is deposited for conversion at any one time by the same holder and with the same conversion agent and in circumstances where the conversion shares issuable on conversion of the bonds are to be registered in the same name(s), the number of conversion shares to be issued on conversion of the bonds will be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of bonds to be converted. fractions of conversion shares will not be issued on conversion, and no cash adjustments will be made in respect of any such fraction. however, in the event there is a consolidation or reclassification of shares by operation of law or otherwise occurring after june 14, 1999 that reduces the number of shares outstanding, the bank will pay in cash the portion of the principal amount of the bond or bonds to be converted that corresponds to any fraction of a conversion share not issued, if such portion of such principal amount exceeds u.s.$10.00. (iii) revival after default: notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph (a), if the bank shall default in making payment in full in respect of any bond called for redemption on the date fixed for redemption or payment thereof pursuant to condition 9(b) or condition 11, the conversion right attaching to such bond will continue to be exercisable, and the conversion period in respect of such bond shall continue, up to and including the close of business (at the place where the conversion notice and the certificate representing such bond, if any, are deposited in connection with the exercise of the conversion right) on the date prior to the date on which the full amount payable in respect of such bond has been duly received by the trustee or the principal paying agent appointed pursuant to the agency agreement (the "principal paying agent") and notice of receipt has been given to the bondholders or, if earlier, the date that is one month prior to the maturity date, and notwithstanding the provisions of conditions 7(a)(i) and 7(b)(ii), any bonds in respect of which a certificate and conversion notice were deposited for conversion prior to such date shall be converted on the conversion date in respect thereof notwithstanding that the notice referred to above may have been duly given before such conversion date or that the conversion period may have expired before such conversion date. (iv) definition of conversion shares and shares: as used in this condition, the expression "conversion shares" means the shares (or all other (if any) shares or stock resulting from any subdivision, consolidation or reclassification of such shares) into which the bonds convert upon the due exercise of the conversion right. "shares" means shares of common stock, par value won 5,000 per share, of the bank and shares of any class or classes resulting from any sub-division, consolidation or reclassification of such shares or into which such shares may thereafter be changed. (b) procedures (i) conversion notices; taxes and duties: to exercise the conversion right attaching to any bond, the registered holder (with respect to any bonds represented by a global bond, on behalf of any person owning a beneficial interest therein) must complete, execute and deposit at such holder's or beneficial owner's own expense during the conversion period during normal business hours on any business day in the place at the specified office of the principal conversion agent (the "principal conversion agent") or any of the other conversion agents appointed pursuant to the agency agreement (together, the "conversion agents") a notice of conversion (a "conversion notice") in duplicate in the form obtainable from the specified office of each conversion agent, together with the relevant certificate (other than a global bond certificate) and any amount required to be paid by the holder or beneficial owner pursuant to this condition 7(b)(i). a converting holder or beneficial owner (through the holder) must pay to the applicable conversion agent all stamp, issue, registration or similar taxes or duties or transfer costs (if any) arising in connection with the conversion of a bond in the country of the conversion agent with which the conversion notice and certificate is deposited, or payable in any jurisdiction (other than korea) consequent upon the issue or delivery of conversion shares or any other securities, property or cash before the bank is obliged to issue or deliver the same. the bank will pay all other expenses arising solely on conversion of the bonds and the issue of conversion shares pursuant thereto (including the charges of any agent or the registrar). a certificate and conversion notice once deposited may not be withdrawn without the consent in writing of the bank. for purposes of this condition, a "business day" in any location is a date on which commercial banks generally are open for business in such location. (ii) registration and delivery of shares: the fifth business day in seoul following the day on which a conversion notice has been deposited with a conversion agent in full compliance with the foregoing procedures is referred to herein as a "conversion date" (unless any amounts required to be paid under condition 7(b)(i) have not been paid by the immediately preceding business day in seoul, in which case the business day in seoul after the business day in seoul on which such amounts are paid shall be the "conversion date"). with effect from the conversion date, the bank will deem the converting bondholder to have become the holder of record of the number of conversion shares to be issued on such conversion (disregarding any retroactive adjustment of the conversion price referred to below prior to the time such retroactive adjustment shall have become effective). thereafter the bank will, subject to any applicable limitations then imposed by korean laws and regulations, according to the request made in the relevant conversion notice, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 21 days after the conversion date, (x) to deliver or cause to be delivered to the order of the person named for that purpose in the relevant conversion notice or make available or cause to be made available at the specified office in seoul for the time being of the bank a certificate or certificates for the relevant conversion shares registered in the name of the converting bondholder or, in cases permitted under korean law, any other person specified for that purpose in the relevant conversion notice, together with any other securities, property or cash required to be delivered upon conversion and such assignments and other documents (if any) as may be required by law to effect the delivery thereof; or (y) to register korea securities depository (or its successor organization) as holder of the relevant number of conversion shares in the bank's shareholders' register and cause korea securities depository (or its successor organization) to credit such conversion shares to the deposit account of the custodian designated by the converting bondholder in the relevant conversion notice and to deliver or cause to be delivered to the order of the converting bondholder at such specified office of the transfer agent any such other securities, property, cash, assignments and documents. (iii) cancellation of bonds; retroactive and other adjustments: bonds, the conversion right of which has been duly exercised and discharged, will be cancelled, and the bondholder's name will be removed from the bond register on the relevant conversion date with respect to the conversion shares issued. if the conversion date in respect of any conversion shares issued on the exercise of conversion rights pursuant to condition 7(a) is on or after a date after which an adjustment to the conversion price takes effect (retroactively or otherwise) pursuant to any of the provisions referred to in condition 7(c) below and the conversion date in respect of such exercise falls on a date when such adjustment has not yet been reflected in the current conversion price, the bank will cause the provisions of this condition 7(b) to be applied, mutatis mutandis, to such number of conversion shares as is equal to the excess of the number of conversion shares that would have been required to be issued on conversion of such bonds if such adjustment had been given effect as at such conversion date over the number of conversion shares issuable on such conversion without otherwise having given effect to such adjustment. (iv) dividends accrued; interest accrued: any dividend on the conversion shares issued on conversion of any bonds with respect to the dividend accrual period during which the relevant conversion date falls will be paid with respect to the full dividend accrual period on the basis that the conversion took effect at the beginning of such dividend accrual period. "dividend accrual period" means an annual period ending december 31 in any year, unless changed in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. the conversion shares issued on conversion of the bonds will in all other respects rank pari passu with the conversion shares outstanding on the relevant conversion date as if the conversion shares issued on conversion had been issued on such date (except for any right the record date for which precedes such conversion date and any other right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable law). no payment or adjustment will be made on conversion for any interest accrued on any converted bonds since the interest payment date last preceding the relevant conversion date, or, if the bonds are converted before the first interest payment date, june 14, 1999. (c) adjustment of conversion price: the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in certain events set out in the indenture, including: (i) any free distribution of shares or any sub-division, consolidation or reclassification of shares; (ii) the declaration of a dividend in shares; (iii) the grant, issue or offer to the holders of shares of options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares at less than the then current market price per share or to subscribe for or purchase any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or securities which carry rights to subscribe for or purchase, shares at less than the then current market price per share (other than any rights or warrants granted, issued or offered to and accepted by existing employees of the bank in accordance with mandatory provisions of korean law); (iv) the distribution to the holders of shares of assets (other than cash), evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock of the bank (other than shares) or options, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares or securities (other than those mentioned in clause (iii) above and any rights or warrants granted, issued or offered to and accepted by existing employees of the bank in accordance with mandatory provisions of korean law); (v) the issue of shares at less than the then current market price per share (other than shares issued (a) on conversion or exchange of the bonds, the ifc debt or any other convertible or exchangeable securities issued by the bank, except the preferred shares; or (b) on exercise of any options, rights or warrants granted, issued or offered by the bank; or (c) in any of the circumstances described in clauses (i) and (ii) above; or (d) issued to shareholders of any corporation which merges into the bank, in proportion to their shareholding in such corporation immediately prior to such merger, upon such merger); or (vi) the issue of securities (other than the bonds, or inter alia, in any of the circumstances described in clause (iii) above) convertible into or exchangeable for shares, or the grant, issue or offer of options, rights or warrants (to the extent that such rights are taken up) to subscribe for or purchase shares (other than the bonds in any of the circumstances described in clause (iii) above), in each case at less than the then current market price per share or to subscribe for or purchase any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or which carry rights to subscribe for or purchase, shares at less than the then current market price per share; provided, however, that a grant, issue or offer of securities as described in clauses (v) and (vi) above to any director, officer or employee of the bank as part of his compensation will not result in the adjustment of the conversion price to the extent that the number of shares so issued or that may be issued as a result of the conversion, exchange or exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities or such options, rights or warrants so granted, issued or offered, together with the total number of shares issued to such directors, officers and employees and that may be issued (on conversion, exchange or exercise) as a result of all such grants, issues and offers to such directors, officers and employees subsequent to june 14, 1999, does not exceed five per cent. of the total number of shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to such grant, issue or offer. the conversion price will not, however, be reduced below the par value of the shares (currently won 5,000 per share) as a result of any such adjustment and the bank has covenanted in the indenture not to take any action that would otherwise reduce the conversion price below the par value of the shares, unless, under applicable law then in effect, bonds could be converted at such reduced conversion price into legally issued, fully-paid, non-assessable shares. no adjustment will be made where such adjustment would be less than won 100, provided that any such adjustment that is not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. any adjustment will be notified promptly by the bank to the bondholders, (so long as the bonds are listed on the london stock exchange or the luxembourg stock exchange) the london stock exchange or the luxembourg stock exchange, as the case may be, and the paying agents appointed pursuant to the agency agreement (together, the "paying agents") at their specified offices and information regarding any such adjustment will be made available at such paying agents' offices including, so long as the bonds are listed on the london stock exchange or the luxembourg stock exchange, the london or the luxembourg office. the bank reserves the right to make certain reductions in the conversion price in addition to those required by the foregoing provisions in certain circumstances. for the purposes of this condition 7(c): "current market price per share" of shares on any date means the average of the market prices) for the five consecutive trading days selected by the bank commencing not more than 20 trading days before, and ending not later than, the earlier of the date in question and the day before the date on which the shares trade without the right to receive such issuance or distribution requiring such computation. "market price", for any trading day, means the closing sales price of the shares on the korea stock exchange on such day or, if no reported sales take place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and offered prices in either case as reported by the korea stock exchange for such day or, if the shares are not on such day listed or admitted to trading on the korea stock exchange, the average of the closing bid and offered prices of the shares for such day as furnished by a leading independent member firm of the korea stock exchange selected from time to time by the bank for the purpose. "trading day" means a day when the korea stock exchange is open for business. if there shall occur an event giving rise to a change in the conversion price during the 20 trading day period referred to above, appropriate adjustments for the relevant days shall be made for the purpose of calculating the market price for such days. if no price as aforesaid is reported on the korea stock exchange (or furnished by a member firm as aforesaid) for one or more consecutive trading days, such day or days will be disregarded in the relevant calculation and will be deemed not to have existed when ascertaining such 20 trading day period. (d) effect of merger, etc.: in the case of any consolidation with, or merger of the bank into, any other person or any merger or consolidation of another person into the bank (other than a merger in which the bank is the continuing corporation or a consolidation or merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares), or any sale, transfer or lease of all, or substantially all, of the properties or assets of the bank, the person resulting from such consolidation or merger, or which acquires, transfers or leases such properties or assets of the bank, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the holder of each bond then outstanding will have the right thereafter during the conversion period to convert such bond only into the kind and amount of shares and other securities, cash and property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease by a holder of the number of shares into which such bond might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease, assuming such holder of shares is not a person with which the bank consolidated or into which the bank merged or which merged into the bank, or to which such sale, transfer or lease was made, as the case may be (a "constituent person"), or an affiliate of a constituent person, and failed to exercise his right of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of shares or other securities, cash or other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease (provided that if the kind or amount of shares or other securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease is not the same for each share in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this condition 7(d) the kind and amount of shares or other securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). the supplemental indenture will provide for adjustments that will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in condition 7(c). the above provisions of this condition 7(d) will apply in the same way to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamation, mergers, sales, transfers or leases. (e) listing on exchange: the bank has undertaken in the indenture that it will use its best efforts to cause the conversion shares to be listed on the korea stock exchange promptly after the issue of the conversion shares and that, for so long as any bonds are outstanding, it will use its best efforts (i) to maintain a listing for all the issued shares, including the conversion shares, on the korea stock exchange and (ii) if the bank is unable to obtain or maintain such listing, to obtain and maintain a listing for all the issued shares, including the conversion shares, on any other stock exchange as the bank may from time to time determine and will promptly give notice to the bondholders and the trustee of the listing or de-listing of the shares by either of the korea stock exchange or any such stock exchange. the bank has undertaken in the indenture to pay the expenses of the issue and listing of conversion shares, except as provided in condition 7(b)(i). the bank has undertaken in the indenture at all times to reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the bonds, the full number of shares then issuable on conversion of all outstanding bonds. 8. payments (a) principal: payment of principal and premium (if any) will be in dollars and will be made (i) with respect to a holder of a global bond, by transfer to the registered account of the holder of such global bond, (ii) with respect to a holder of individual definitive certificates in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than u.s.$250,000, at its option, to its registered account upon application of such holder to the paying agent to whom such certificates shall be presented for payment at least 10 days prior to the relevant payment date with appropriate wire transfer instructions or (iii) in all other cases, by check drawn on a bank in new york city mailed to the registered address of the bondholder. payments of principal will only be made against surrender of the relevant certificate at the specified office of the principal paying agent or any of the other paying agents.

(e) delay in payment: bondholders will not be entitled to any interest or other payment for any delay after the due date in receiving the amount due if the due date at the place of payment (or, in the case of the surrender of a certificate, the place where the certificate is surrendered) is not a business day (provided the amount is duly provided for on or before the due date), if the bondholder is late in surrendering its certificate (if required to do so) or if a check mailed in accordance with this condition arrives after the due date for payment. (f) legal holidays: in any case where any interest payment date or redemption date or the maturity date of any bond shall not be a business day in the applicable place or, in the case of an interest payment date, new york city, then (notwithstanding any other provision of these conditions) payment of interest, principal or premium (if any) of the bonds need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding business day in such place with the same force and effect as if made on the interest payment date, redemption date or the maturity date.

(d) purchases: the bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of the bank may at any time and from time to time purchase bonds at any price in the open market or otherwise. such bonds may, at the option of the bank or the relevant subsidiary or affiliate of the bank, be held, resold or surrendered to any paying agent for cancellation. the bonds so purchased, while held by or on behalf of the bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, shall not entitle the holder to vote at any meeting of the bondholders and shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of calculating the quorum at a meeting of the bondholders or for the purpose of conditions 11 and 13. (e) cancellation: all bonds redeemed or converted by the bank or purchased and surrendered to any paying agent for cancellation as provided in condition 9(d) above will forthwith be cancelled and all certificates in respect of cancelled bonds will be forwarded to or to the order of the principal paying agent and such bonds may not be reissued or resold. (f) redemption notices: all redemption notices to bondholders given by or on behalf of the bank pursuant to condition 9(b) will specify (i) the conversion price as at the date of the notice, (ii) the market price (as defined in section 7(c) of the shares as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice, (iii) the redemption date, (iv) the redemption price, (v) if less than all outstanding bonds are to be redeemed, the aggregate principal amount of the bonds to be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of bonds which will be outstanding after such partial redemption, (vi) that on the redemption date the redemption price of any bond to be redeemed (together with accrued interest thereon) will become due and payable and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date, (vii) the place where certificates are to be surrendered and (viii) the cusip or other identifying numbers of the bonds and/or certificates to be redeemed. 10. taxation all payments by the bank in respect of the bonds will be made after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of korea or by or within any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein having power to tax ("korean taxes"). the bank will pay such additional amounts ("additional amounts") in respect of korean taxes as will result in the payment to holders of the bonds of the amounts of principal, premium (if any) and interest that would otherwise have been receivable by them in respect of payments on such bonds in the absence of such deduction or withholding, except that no such additional amounts shall be payable: (i) to or on behalf of a holder or beneficial owner who is subject to such korean taxes in respect of such bond by reason of such holder or beneficial owner being connected with korea otherwise than merely by holding or beneficially owning such bond or by the receipt of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of any bond; (ii) to or on behalf of a holder or beneficial owner to the extent that such holder or beneficial owner would not be liable for or subject to such deduction or withholding by making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption or deduction to the relevant tax authorities if such holder or beneficial owner is eligible to make such deduction of other claim and, after having been requested to make such a declaration or claim, such holder or beneficial owner fails to do so; or (iii) in circumstances where the surrender of a bond is required under the indenture, if the certificate in respect of such bond is surrendered more than 30 days after the relevant date except to the extent that the holder thereof would have been entitled to such additional amount on presenting the same for payment on the last day of such 30-day period. for this purpose the "relevant date" in relation to any bond means (a) the due date for payment in respect thereof, or (b) if the full amount of the monies payable on such due date has not been received in new york city by the trustee or the principal paying agent on or prior to such due date, the date on which notice is duly given to the bondholders that such monies have been so received. additionally, the obligation of the bank to pay such additional amounts shall not apply with respect to (i) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges or (ii) any taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments on the bonds. the bank will provide the trustee with documentation evidencing the payment of such korean taxes. copies of such documentation will be made available to any holder or any paying agent, as applicable, upon request therefor. in the event that additional amounts actually paid with respect to the bonds are based on rates of deduction or withholding in excess of the appropriate rate applicable to the holder of such bonds, and, as a result thereof, such holder is entitled to make a claim for a refund or credit of such excess, then such holder shall, by accepting the bonds, be deemed to have assigned and transferred all right, title and interest to any such claim for a refund or credit of such excess to the bank. however, by making such assignment, the holder makes no representation or warranty that the bank will be entitled to receive such claim for a refund or credit and incurs no other obligation with respect thereto (including, without limitation, executing any other instrument of transfer or incurring any expense in connection with this transfer). references in these conditions to principal, premium (if any) and interest shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable in respect thereof under this condition. 11. events of default and limited rights of acceleration the following will be events of default under the bonds (each herein referred to as an "event of default"): (i) a default is made for more than 14 days in the payment of the principal or premium (if any) or default is made for more than 21 days in the payment of interest in respect of any of the bonds when and as the same ought to be paid in accordance with these conditions; or (ii) a default is made by the bank in the performance or observance of any covenant, condition or provision contained in the indenture or in the bonds and on its part to be performed or observed (other than the covenant to pay the principal, premium (if any) and interest in respect of any of the bonds) and such default continues for the period of 30 days next following the service by the trustee on the bank, of notice requiring such default to be remedied; or (iii) a default is made or exists under any other bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness for money borrowed having an aggregate principal amount of u.s.$10,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) or more (hereinafter called "indebtedness") of the bank, which default shall have resulted in such indebtedness becoming, or being declared, due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise be due and payable, without such indebtedness having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, or the bank defaults in the repayment of any such indebtedness at the maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of any applicable grace period therefor or any guarantee of or indemnity in respect of any indebtedness of others given by the bank shall not be honored when due and called upon; or (iv) a subordination event (as defined in condition 4) shall have occurred. if an event of default specified in clause (iv) above shall occur and be continuing, the maturity of all outstanding bonds shall automatically be accelerated and the principal amount of the bonds, together with accrued interest and any unpaid additional amounts thereon, immediately due and payable in cash and the only remedy available in respect of such acceleration will be the ability to petition for the liquidation of, or for the commencement of reorganization proceedings in relation to, the bank in the republic of korea (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant requirements of applicable law) or to prove in the liquidation or other applicable proceedings in respect of the bank in the republic of korea. there is no right of acceleration of the payment of principal of the bonds upon the occurrence of any other event of default or a default in the performance of any other covenant or agreement contained in the bonds. if any other event of default shall occur and be continuing, the trustee or a holder of the bonds may (in the case of the event of default specified in clause (i) above) petition for the liquidation of, or for the commencement of reorganization proceedings in relation to, the bank in the republic of korea (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant requirements of applicable law) or to prove in the liquidation or other applicable proceedings in respect of the bank in the republic of korea or (in the case of the events of default specified in (ii) and (iii) above) may seek performance of such covenant or agreement and may have a cause of action against the bank for money damages. no bondholder will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to these conditions unless (i) such holder has previously given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default, (ii) the holders of not less than one-third in principal amount of the outstanding bonds have made written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect thereof in the name of the trustee and, in the case of any such event of default other than those described in clauses (i) and (iv) above, certified that such event of default is materially prejudicial to the interests of the bondholders, (iii) such holder has offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, (iv) the trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding, and (v) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds. 12. prescription funds deposited with the trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the bank, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any bond and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium (if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be repaid to the bank upon its request, or (if then held by the bank) shall be discharged from such trust, and the bondholder shall then look only to the bank for such payment. under korean law, claims against the bank for payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest in respect of any bond will be prescribed unless (i) the holder of such bond files an action with the proper court, files an application for attachment, provisional attachment or provisional disposition on the assets of the bank or requests the bank for such payment (provided that, within six months of such request, an action or application as aforementioned is filed) or (ii) the bank acknowledges its obligation to pay such amounts, in each case within 10 years (in the case of principal and premium (if any)) and five years (in the case of interest) from the relevant date for payment in respect thereof. 13. meetings of bondholders; modification and waiver (a) the indenture contains provisions for convening meetings of the bondholders to consider any matter affecting their interests, including the approval of certain amendments or modifications of the bonds or the provisions of the indenture upon either the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds or the approval of persons entitled to vote a majority of the principal amount of such bonds represented and voting at a meeting of the bondholders duly called. the quorum at such meeting shall be one or more persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds, or at an adjourned such meeting, one or more persons entitled to vote 25 per cent. in amount of outstanding bonds. (b) the bank and the trustee may enter into indentures supplemental to the indenture for the purpose of modifying the bonds and the indenture and the rights of the bondholders thereunder; provided, however, that without the approval of the written consent of the holders of 90 per cent. in principal amount of the outstanding bonds or the approval of persons entitled to vote 75 per cent. of the principal amount of such bonds represented and voting at a meeting of the holders duly called, and where at such meeting a special quorum shall be required comprising one or more persons entitled to vote two-thirds in principal amount of the outstanding bonds, or at an adjourned such meeting, one or more persons entitled to vote one-third in amount of outstanding bonds, no amendment or modification shall be made to the bonds (including these conditions) or the indenture to (i) change the maturity date of the principal or premium (if any) or the interest payment date of any bond; (ii) reduce or cancel the principal amount thereof, the amount of premium (if any) or the rate of interest thereon; (iii) change the place of payment where, or the currency in which, any bond or interest thereon is payable or the method of calculating any such payment; (iv) impair the right to enforce any such payment on or after the stated maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the date of redemption); (v) alter the obligations of the bank under conditions 3(a), 9(a), 9(b) or 10; (vi) modify, cancel or adversely affect the conversion rights or the provisions of condition 7 (except as permitted by condition 13(c)(iv)); (vii) modify the obligations of the bank to maintain offices or agencies as set forth in these conditions or the indenture; (viii) reduce the stated percentage of principal amount of the outstanding bonds, the consent of the holders of which is required for any amendment to the indenture or these conditions, or the consent of the holders of which is required for any waiver provided for in the indenture and these conditions; or (ix) modify any of the percentage voting and quorum provisions in this condition 13 except to increase any such percentage, or otherwise reduce the percentage of principal amount of the outstanding bonds, the consent of the holders of which is required for taking action. (c) without the consent of any bondholders, the bank and the trustee may enter into one or more supplemental indentures (i) to evidence the succession of another person to the bank; (ii) to add to the covenants of the bank for the benefit of the bondholders or to surrender any right or power conferred on the bank; (iii) to secure the bonds; (iv) to make certain provisions with respect to the conversion rights upon a consolidation or merger; (v) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision in the indenture which may be inconsistent with any other provision therein or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the indenture that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the indenture, provided that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the bondholders in any material respect; or (vi) to make any other modifications to the bonds or the indenture of a formal, minor or technical nature or necessary to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of the law of korea so long as such modification does not adversely affect the rights of any bondholder in any material respect. (d) the bondholders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding bonds may on behalf of all bondholders waive any past default under these conditions and its consequences except (i) defaults in the payment of the principal, premium (if any) or interest on any bond, and (ii) defaults in respect of a covenant or provision of these conditions or the indenture which under the indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each affected bondholder. (e) any modification, amendment or waiver approved in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be binding on all the bondholders, whether or not present or represented at a meeting. promptly after the execution by the bank and the trustee of any supplemental indenture, the bank shall give notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, in the manner provided in condition 15. 14. replacement of certificates if any certificate is mutilated, defaced, destroyed, stolen or lost, it may be replaced at the specified office of the registrar and at the specified office of any paying agent upon payment by the claimant of such costs as may be incurred in connection therewith and on such terms as to evidence and indemnity as the bank and the registrar may reasonably require. mutilated or defaced certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be issued. in the event any such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen certificate has become
