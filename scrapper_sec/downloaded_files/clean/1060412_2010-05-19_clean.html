whereas: &#160; a. &#160; the preferred holders are holders of shares of series a preferred stock (&#8220;series a preferred&#8221;) of the company as set forth on schedule a. &#160; b. &#160; the company and its securityholders, including the preferred holders, are entering into a share exchange agreement of even date herewith (the &#8220;sea&#8221;) with the parent and its shareholder, pursuant to which all of the company&#8217;s securityholders are exchanging their securities (the &#8220;share exchange&#8221;) in the company for shares of common stock $0.001 par value per share of the parent (&#8220;parent common stock&#8221;). &#160; c. &#160; in the share exchange, the preferred holders are exchanging their shares of series a preferred for the number of shares of parent common stock set forth opposite their names on schedule a. &#160; d. &#160; pursuant to the sea, the company and the parent are contemplating an additional financing, a &#8220;qualified financing&#8221; as hereafter defined, following the share exchange. &#160; e. &#160; under the company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation (the &#8220;certificate&#8221;), the preferred holders are entitled to an adjustment of the conversion price (the &#8220;conversion price&#8221;) of the series a preferred in the event that the company issues or sells &#8220;additional shares&#8221;

g. &#160; as an inducement to the preferred holders to enter into the sea and terminate any other rights they have under the series a preferred and the documents and instruments executed by them and the company in connection with the issuance of such shares, rhg is willing to agree to transfer some of its shares of parent common stock to the preferred holders if parent common stock is issued in the qualified financing at less than the conversion price, as adjusted for the share exchange, on the terms set forth herein. &#160; now, therefore , in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: &#160; 1. &#160; make good provisions . &#160; (a) &#160; qualified financings .&#160;&#160;means the convertible debt facility (as defined in the sea) and/or the additional financing (as defined in the sea). &#160; (b) &#160; shares to be transferred in convertible debt facility .&#160;&#160;in the event that shares of parent common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of parent common stock are issued to the investors in the convertible debt facility at a purchase/exercise/conversion price per share of parent common stock (the &#8220;issuance price&#8221;) of less than $0.997 1 , then rhg shall assign and transfer to each of the preferred holders a sufficient number of additional shares of parent common stock to increase the number of shares of parent common stock owned by each preferred holder to the number of shares of parent common stock determined by dividing the aggregate original purchase price paid by such preferred holder for its series&#160;a preferred as set forth on schedule a by the issuance price in the convertible debt facility. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a preferred holder has sold a portion that is less than all of its parent common stock in an underwritten public offering of parent common stock registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (a &#8220;public offering&#8221;), then the number of shares to be transferred pursuant to this section 1(b) shall be the number calculated pursuant to the foregoing sentence, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of parent common stock held by such preferred holder immediately prior to the public offering minus the number of shares sold in such public offering and the denominator of which is the number of shares of parent common stock held by such preferred holder immediately prior to the public offering. &#160; (c) &#160; shares to be transferred in additional financing .&#160;&#160;&#160;in the event that shares of parent common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of parent common stock are issued to the investors in the additional financing at an issuance price less than the issuance price in the convertible debt facility, then rhg shall assign and transfer to each of the preferred holders a sufficient number of additional shares of parent common stock to increase the number of shares of parent common stock owned by each preferred holder to the number of shares of parent common stock determined by dividing the aggregate original purchase price paid by such preferred holder for its series&#160;a preferred as set forth on schedule a by the issuance price in the additional financing. notwithstanding the foregoing, a public offering shall not constitute an additional financing. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a preferred holder has sold a portion that is less than all of its parent common stock in a public offering, then the number of shares to be transferred pursuant to this section 1(c) shall be the number calculated pursuant to the foregoing sentence, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of parent common stock held by such preferred holder immediately prior to the public offering minus the number of shares sold in such public and the denominator of which is the number of shares of parent common stock held by such preferred holder immediately prior to the public offering. &#160; 1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;calculated&#160;&#160;by dividing $274,987.96 by the number of shares of parent common stock issued to the preferred holders in the share exchange.&#160;&#160;the number of shares so issued was calculated on a fully diluted basis, inclusive of the shares to be reserved for an employee equity incentive plan. 2 (d) &#160; make good shares .&#160;&#160;any shares of parent common stock required to be transferred to a preferred holder pursuant to section 1 (b) and/or section 1 (c) are referred to herein as the &#8220;make good shares&#8221;. &#160; (e) &#160; issuance price .&#160;&#160;if the securities issued in the qualified financing are issued at or deemed to be issued at different effective prices per share of parent common stock, then the issuance price shall be determined by calculating the weighted average issuance price of such shares.&#160;&#160;for purposes of determining the purchase price for the shares issued or deemed issued in the qualified financing, the gross amount of cash received by the parent in the qualified financing for the issuance of parent common stock or other securities of parent convertible into or exercisable for shares of parent common stock shall be taken into account.&#160;&#160;all securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of parent common stock upon payment of consideration per share of common stock (warrants, options or other rights to acquire shares of parent common stock) shall be assumed to have been converted/exercised and the conversion/exercise price of such securities shall be deemed received by the company.&#160;&#160;shares or convertible securities issued to any placement agent or underwriter for the qualified financing shall not be deemed shares issued in the qualified financing. &#160; (f) &#160; expiration of make good adjustment .&#160;&#160;if no qualified financing is completed within two (2) years following the date hereof, then the preferred holders shall not be entitled to any additional shares of parent common stock as provided in this section 1 .&#160;&#160;the right to additional shares shall terminate (i) upon completion of the additional financing and the convertible debt facility, (ii) with respect to a preferred holder, upon a public offering in which such preferred holder sells all of the parent common stock requested by such preferred holder to be included in such public offering or (iii) with respect to a preferred holder, following a public offering, if such preferred holder does not use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell any remaining parent common stock within three (3) months, of the closing of such offering. &#160; (g) &#160; transfer of make good shares .&#160;&#160;on the closing date of the completion of a qualified financing or within five (5) business day thereafter, rhg shall assign to each preferred holder the make good shares to which each is entitled.&#160;&#160;the parent shall cause title to such make good shares to be promptly transferred in its stock ownership records. &#160;
