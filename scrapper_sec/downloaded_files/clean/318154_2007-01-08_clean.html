provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement is subject to the condition that, insofar as it relates to any such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the sec at the time the registration statement becomes effective, or in the amended prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to rule 424(b) (the &#147; final prospectus &#148;), such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter, or the investor, if there is no underwriter, if a copy of the final prospectus was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the act, and, provided further, that the company shall not be liable to any indemnitee in any such case to the extent that any such liability arises out of or is based upon any (i) statements or omissions, or alleged statements or omissions, made in such registration statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or prospectuses (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the investor specifically to be included in such registration statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and (ii) any such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or 9 alleged omission made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated or remedied in the final prospectus, if a copy of the final prospectus was not furnished to the person or entity asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the act. in no case shall the company be liable under this indemnity agreement with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense with respect to any claim made against any indemnitee (i) with respect to any settlement made by any indemnitee without the express prior written consent of the company, and (ii) unless the company shall be notified in writing of the nature of the claim within a reasonable time after the assertion thereof, provided that the company shall be liable under this indemnity agreement with respect to any such claim notwithstanding the lack of such notice within a reasonable time if such lack of notice does not prejudice the ability of the company to defend such claim, and provided further that the failure to so notify the company shall not relieve the company from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. in case of any such notice, the company shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense, or if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, to assume the defense and settlement of any suit brought to enforce any such claim; but if it so elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnitee(s) and other defendant or defendants, if any, in any suit so brought, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. in the event that the company elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retain such counsel, the indemnitee(s) and other defendant or defendants, if any, in the suit shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel thereafter retained by them;

relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided , that in no event shall any contribution by the investor under subsection (b) of this section 6 exceed in the aggregate the net proceeds from the offering received by the investor.

(c) all fees and expenses of the indemnitees (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section 6 ) shall be paid by the company, as incurred, within ten (10) business days of written notice thereof, which notice may be given no more than once a month, to the company (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided , that the company may require such indemnitee to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).
