(b) to the extent permitted by law, the investor named in such registration statement as a selling shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of the company, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses to the extent (and only to the extent) that any such losses are based upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the investor expressly for use in such registration statement; and the -7- investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by the company and any such officer, director, employee, agent, representative, or controlling person, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss if such settlement is effected without the consent of the investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection 6(b) exceed the net proceeds resulting from the sale of the registrable securities sold by the purchaser under the registration statement. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of one such counsel to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, to the extent prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 6 with respect to such action, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 6 or with respect to any other action unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of not receiving such notice. (d) in the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 6 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the company and the investor agree, severally and not jointly, to contribute to the aggregate losses to which the company or the investor may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and the investor in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses; provided, however, that in no case shall the investor be responsible for any amount in excess of the proceeds resulting from the sale of the registrable securities sold by it under the registration statement. relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the company or by the investor. the company and the investor agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. for purposes of this section 6, each person who controls the investor within the meaning of either the securities act or the exchange act and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the investor shall have the same rights to contribution as the investor, and each person who controls the company within the meaning of either the securities act -8- or the exchange act and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the company shall have the same rights to contribution as the company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
