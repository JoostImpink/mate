any future violation of sections 5(a) and (c) of the securities act. on december 3, 2002, salomon smith barney inc. (&#147;salomon smith barney&#148;), now named citigroup global markets inc. (&#147;cgmi&#148;), a subsidiary of citigroup, was one of eight respondents to settle sec, nyse, and nasd charges of violations of the record-keeping requirements of section 17(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (&#147;exchange act&#148;) and rule 17a-4 thereunder during the period from 1999 to at least 2001. the sec order found that, during all or part of the relevant period, each

or liability for purposes of any other proceeding. on july 28, 2003, citigroup settled enforcement proceedings related to the manipulation of enron&#146;s and dynegy&#146;s financial statements. the commission found that citigroup knew or should have known that the acts or omissions described in the order would contribute to enron&#146;s and dynegy&#146;s violations of exchange act section 10(b) and exchange act rule 10b-5. consequently, citigroup was found to be a cause of enron&#146;s and dynegy&#146;s violations within the meaning of exchange act section 21c. citigroup consented to an order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and agreed to pay $120 million as disgorgement, interest and penalty. on

promulgated under the exchange act. specifically, the order found that there were two distinct disclosure failures by cgmi in the offer and sale of mutual fund shares to its customers. based on these findings, the order censured cgmi, required that cgmi cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of section 17(a) of the securities act and exchange act rule 10b-10, and required that cgmi pay a $20 million civil money penalty. in a related proceeding on march 22, 2005, the nasd accepted a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent dated march 18, 2005 (the &#147;awc&#148;) that had been submitted by cgmi. without admitting or denying the findings, cgmi accepted and consented, prior to a hearing and without an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of findings by nasd. based on its findings and with cgmi&#146;s consent, the nasd censured cgmi and fined it $6.25 million. in the awc, cgmi also agreed to complete certain undertakings, including retaining an independent consultant, among other things, to conduct a comprehensive review of the completeness of its table of contents 68 of 68 disclosures regarding the differences in mutual fund share classes and the policies and procedures relating to cgmi&#146;s recommendations to its customers of different class shares of mutual funds. on may 31, 2005, the sec issued an order in connection with the settlement of an administrative proceeding against smith barney fund management llc (&#147;sbfm&#148;), a former subsidiary of citigroup, and cgmi relating to the appointment of an affiliated transfer agent for the smith barney family of mutual funds (&#147;smith barney funds&#148;). the sec order found that sbfm and cgmi willfully violated section 206(1) of the investment advisers act of 1940 (&#147;advisers act&#148;). specifically, the order found that sbfm and cgmi knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose to the boards of the smith barney funds in 1999 when proposing a new transfer agent arrangement with an affiliated transfer agent that: first data investors services group (&#147;first data&#148;), the smith barney funds&#146; then-existing transfer agent, had offered to continue as transfer agent and do the same work for substantially less money than before; and that the citigroup asset management business unit (&#147;cam&#148;), the former citigroup business unit that included the smith barney fund&#146;s investment manager and other investment advisory companies, had entered into a side letter with first data under which cam agreed to recommend the appointment of first data as sub-transfer agent to the affiliated transfer agent in exchange, among other things, for a guarantee by first data of specified amounts of asset management and investment banking fees to cam and cgmi. the order also found that sbfm and cgmi willfully violated section 206(2) of the advisers act by virtue of the omissions discussed above and other misrepresentations and omissions in the materials provided to the smith barney funds&#146; boards, including the failure to make clear that the affiliated transfer agent would earn a high profit for performing limited functions while first data continued to perform almost all of the transfer agent functions, and the suggestion that the proposed arrangement was in the smith barney funds&#146; best interests and that no viable alternatives existed. sbfm and cgmi did not admit or deny any wrongdoing or liability. the settlement did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceeding. the sec censured sbfm and cgmi and ordered them to cease and desist from violations of sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the advisers act. the order required citigroup to pay $208.1 million, including $109 million in disgorgement of profits, $19.1 million in interest, and a civil money penalty of $80 million. the order also required that transfer agency fees received from the smith barney funds since december 1, 2004 less certain expenses be placed in escrow and provided that a portion of such fees may be subsequently distributed in accordance with the terms of the order. the order required sbfm to recommend a new transfer agent contract to the smith barney fund boards within 180 days of the entry of the order; if a citigroup affiliate submits a proposal to serve as transfer agent or sub-transfer agent, an independent monitor must be engaged at the expense of sbfm and cgmi to oversee a competitive bidding process. under the order, citigroup also must comply with an amended version of a vendor policy that citigroup instituted in august 2004. that policy, as amended, among other things, requires that when requested by a smith barney fund board, cam will retain at its own expense an independent consulting expert to advise and assist the board on the selection of certain service providers affiliated with citigroup. merrill entities : on may 31, 2006, as part of a settlement relating to managing auctions for auction rate securities, the commission accepted the offer of settlement of merrill lynch, pierce, fenner &#038; smith incorporated (&#147; mlpf&#038;s &#148;) and issued a settlement order on may 31, 2006. the commission found, and mlpf&#38;s neither admitted nor denied, that mlpf&#038;s violated section 17(a)(2) of the securities act of 1933 by managing auctions for auction rate securities in ways that were not adequately disclosed or that did not conform to disclosed procedures. mlpf&#038;s submitted, and the commission accepted, an offer of settlement whereby, without admitting or denying the findings contained in the commission&#146;s order, mlpf&#038;s consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a civil money penalty of $1,500,000 (paid to the commission on june 1, 2006) and compliance with certain undertakings to provide customers with written descriptions of mlp&#038;f&#146;s material auction practices and procedures and to implement procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect failures by mlp&#038;f&#146;s to conduct auctions for auction rate securities in accordance with disclosed procedures. in march 2005, merrill lynch reached agreements with the state of new jersey and the new york stock exchange and reached an agreement in principle with the state of connecticut pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a settlement that included findings that it failed to maintain certain books and records and to reasonably supervise a team of former fas who facilitated improper market timing by a hedge fund client. merrill lynch terminated the fas in october 2003, brought the matter to the attention of regulators, and cooperated fully in the regulators&#146; review. the settlement will result in aggregate payments of $13.5 million. in march 2005, merrill lynch reached an agreement in principle with the new york stock exchange pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, will consent to a settlement that includes findings with regard to certain matters relating to the failure to deliver prospectuses

criminal misconduct in connection with a nigerian barge transaction that the government alleged helped enron inflate its 1999 earnings by $12 million. the jury also found that the transaction led to investor losses of $13.7 million. those convictions were reversed by a federal appellate court on august 1, 2006, except for one conviction against one employee based on perjury and obstruction of justice. in 2003, merrill lynch agreed to pay $80 million to settle sec charges that it aided and abetted enron&#146;s fraud by engaging in two improper year-end transactions in 1999, including the nigerian barge transaction. the $80 million paid in connection with the settlement with the sec will be made available to settle investor claims. in september 2003, the united states department of justice agreed not to prosecute merrill lynch for crimes that may have been committed by its former employees related to certain transactions with enron, subject to certain understandings, including merrill lynch&#146;s continued cooperation with the department, its acceptance of responsibility for conduct of its former employees, and its agreement to adopt and implement new policies and procedures related to the integrity of client and counter-party financial statements, complex structured finance transactions and year-end transactions. on or about june 27, 2003, the attorney general for the state of west virginia brought an action against the defendants that participated in the april 28, 2003, settlement described above. the action, filed in the west virginia state court, alleges that the defendants&#146; research practices violated the west virginia consumer credit and protection act. on august 27, 2003, defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that the west virginia consumer credit and protection act does not relate to or apply to securities and the complaint exceeds the attorney general&#146;s authority. in addition, merrill lynch filed a supplemental brief asserting that because it had already settled with the state of west virginia in november 2003 concerning the same alleged research practices, the present action was barred. on october 1, 2003, the west virginia attorney general filed his response, and on october 27, 2003, the defendants filed their replies. on september 16, 2005, the circuit court of marshall county, west virginia, dismissed the case, following an earlier decision by the west virginia supreme court holding that the west virginia attorney general lacked authority to bring the claims. on april 28, 2003, the securities and exchange commission, new york stock exchange, national association of securities dealers, and state securities regulators announced that the settlements-in-principle that the regulators had disclosed on december 20, 2002 had been reduced to final settlements with regard to ten securities firms, including merrill lynch. on october 31, 2003, the united states district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgments in connection with the april 28, 2003, research settlements. the final settlements pertaining to merrill lynch, which involved both monetary and non-monetary relief set forth in the regulators&#146; announcements, brought to a conclusion the regulatory actions against merrill lynch related to alleged conflicts of interest affecting research analysts. merrill lynch entered into these settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and findings by the regulators, and the settlements did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceedings. on march 17, 2003, merrill lynch announced that it had entered into a final settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission regarding a previously disclosed investigation into two 1999 transactions with enron. this agreement, in which merrill lynch neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, finalized a previously reported settlement-in-principle of

prosecute merrill lynch for crimes that may have been committed by its former employees related to certain transactions with enron, subject to certain understandings, including merrill lynch&#146;s continued cooperation with the department, its acceptance of responsibility for conduct of its former employees, and its agreement to adopt and implement new policies and procedures related to the

affected investor &#148;) to (i) modify or forego any or all of its governance rights with respect to parent and its affiliates until such future time as such objections would no longer be applicable if the requisite investors determine in good faith that such action may contribute to the resolution of such objections or, (ii) solely in the event the affected investor does not consent to the modification or elimination of its governance rights proposed by the requisite investors pursuant to clause (i), assign all of its rights and obligations under this agreement and under its guarantee and equity commitment letter with respect to all or any portion of its commitments to a person selected by the requisite investors, provided such person agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement, such guarantee and such equity commitment letter (including assuming any and all liabilities and obligations of the affected investor under such agreements and instruments) with respect to the portion (if less than all) of the commitments so assigned and assumed and the other investors provide the affected investor with a mutually satisfactory indemnity with respect to its liability under this agreement, such guarantee and such equity commitment letter (with respect to the portion (if less than all) of the commitments so assigned) or obtain a full and unconditional release of the affected investor from this agreement, such guarantee and such equity commitment letter with respect to the portion (if less than all) of the commitments so assigned and assumed, except with respect to breaches of this agreement and such equity commitment letter occurring prior to the date of such release. the requisite investors will consult with the affected investor before directing the affected investor to take any of the foregoing actions and will use all reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve such objections. 2.13. contribution with respect to guarantees . the investors shall cooperate in defending any claim that the investors are or any one of them is liable to make payments under the guarantees. subject to section 4.3, each sponsor investor and family investor agrees to contribute to the amount paid or payable by the other sponsor investors and family investor, as the case may be, in respect of the guarantees so that each such sponsor investor or family investor will have paid an amount equal to the product of the aggregate amount paid under all of the guarantees multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator is such investor&#146;s commitments and the denominator is the sum of the sponsors investors&#146; and family investor&#146;s commitments, which amount shall be reduced proportionately based on such sponsor investors&#146; and family investor&#146;s respective commitments for any amounts paid or payable with respect to such guarantees by any other investor or other person contributing equity to parent pursuant to the terms of such investor&#146;s equity commitment letter. 2.14. voting . until this agreement (other than the sections identified in the parenthetical in section 1.1) is terminated pursuant to section 1.1, at the company stockholder meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including a written consent) with respect to the merger agreement, the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement is sought, the family investor shall vote or execute consents with respect to (or cause to be voted or consents to be executed with respect to) all shares of common stock (as defined in the merger agreement) beneficially owned by the family investor as of the applicable record date in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, the merger and any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. 3. definitions. for purposes of this agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings (all other capitalized terms used but not defined shall have the meanings given thereto in the merger agreement): &#147;
