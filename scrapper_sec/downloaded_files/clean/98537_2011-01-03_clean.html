or beneficially by each stockholder. the stockholders&#146; obligations under the tender agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the termination of the merger agreement in

or a reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of todd or its subsidiaries, and (3) to the extent submitted to a stockholder vote, any change in the business, management or the company board (other than as directed by parent or merger sub) or (4) any other action, proposal or agreement that could (a) reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, materially delay or

tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the offer, vigor is entitled to designate a number of directors to the board of directors of todd, rounded up to the next whole number, that is equal to the total number of directors on todd&#146;s board of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of shares beneficially owned by vigor and its subsidiaries (including shares accepted for payment pursuant to the offer) bears to the number of shares then outstanding, provided, however, that if vigor&#146;s designees are appointed or elected to todd&#146;s board of directors, until the effective time of the merger, todd&#146;s board of directors must have at least two independent directors. todd shall

directors (including by amending the bylaws of todd if necessary), filling vacancies or newly created directorships on todd&#146;s board of directors and obtaining the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointed to todd&#146;s board of directors in compliance with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable prior to the effective time of the merger, rule 10a-3 under the exchange act and the nyse rules. after merger sub accepts for payment any shares validly tendered in the offer, todd has also agreed to, upon vigor&#146;s request, cause the directors elected or designated by vigor to the board of directors of todd to serve on and constitute the same percentage as is on todd&#146;s board of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, of each committee of todd&#146;s board of directors, except for any committee established to take action with respect to the subject matter of the merger agreement, the board of directors of each of todd&#146;s subsidiaries and each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law and the nyse rules. unless vigor has given its prior written consent, the merger agreement prohibits todd from (i) declaring, setting aside or paying any dividends on, or making any other distributions (whether in cash, property, stock or other securities) in respect of, any of its capital stock or other equity or voting interests, except for any dividends by a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of todd to its parent, other than the payment by todd of the quarterly cash dividend declared by todd on august 20, 2010 of $0.10 per share of common stock and a dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock contemplated to be declared in december, 2010 to be paid on or after march 11, 2011 to stockholders of record as of a date that is on or after march 11, 2011; (ii) splitting, combining or reclassifying any of its capital stock or other equity or voting interests, or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock or other equity or voting interests, except under limited circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement; (iii) purchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring any shares of capital stock or any other securities of todd or any of its subsidiaries or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other securities, except under limited circumstances set forth in the merger agreement; and (iv) issuing, delivering, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering any shares of its capital stock, any other equity or voting interests or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire, any such stock, interests or securities or any stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, stock-based performance units, &#147;phantom&#148; stock awards or other rights that are linked to the value of common stock or the value of todd or any part thereof, except under limited circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement. additionally, under the merger agreement, todd has granted to merger sub an irrevocable right (the &#147; top-up &#148;), which may be automatically exercised immediately following consummation of the offer, if necessary, to purchase from todd the number of shares of todd common stock that, when added to the shares already owned by vigor and its subsidiaries following consummation of the offer, constitutes at least 90% of the then outstanding shares, provided that merger sub may only purchase up to the number of shares that are authorized but unissued at the time of exercise of the top-up. unless vigor has given its prior written consent, the merger agreement prohibits todd from (i) amending the certificate of incorporation of todd or the by-laws of todd or other comparable charter or organizational documents of todd or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) acquiring or agreeing to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing all or a substantial portion of the assets of, or by purchasing all or a substantial equity or voting interest in, or by any other manner, any natural person, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, business association, governmental entity or other entity or business or division thereof. at the effective time of the merger, merger sub&#146;s certificate of incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, except that all references to the merger sub will be automatically be amended and will become references to the surviving corporation. the by-laws of merger sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the by-laws of the surviving corporation. the directors of merger sub will become the directors of the surviving corporation and the officers of todd will become the officers of the surviving corporation. following the purchase of shares in the offer, vigor plans to immediately consummate the merger. upon consummation of the merger, todd&#146;s common stock will cease to be quoted on any quotation system or exchange, and will become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, none of the reporting persons,
