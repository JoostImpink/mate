agreements associated with the dte transaction and issuer transaction and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. the dte foundation voting agreement and dte energy voting agreement were executed in connection with a stock purchase agreement, dated as of april 10, 2006, between smart hydrogen and dte foundation (the &#147;dte foundation purchase agreement&#148;), a copy of which is

of the transaction described in item 4 as the &#147;issuer transaction.&#148; the funds that will be used for the purchase of shares from dte foundation will come from smart hydrogen&#146;s working capital. the transactions contemplated by the dte foundation voting agreement, dte energy voting agreement, and dte foundation purchase agreement are sometimes referred to in this statement collectively as the &#147;dte transaction.&#148; page 11 item 4. purpose of the transaction the information contained in items 3, 5, and 6 of this statement is hereby incorporated by reference into this item 4. this statement relates to smart hydrogen&#146;s acquisition of beneficial ownership of 13,732,927 shares of common stock through the ge purchase agreement, and dte foundation voting agreement, and the dte energy voting agreement described in item 3. these shares constitute 15.8% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock. beneficial ownership of these shares has been acquired by smart hydrogen in connection with the issuer transaction described in this item 4, which is a component of smart hydrogen&#146;s broader strategy to invest in the hydrogen fuel cell industry in the united states and elsewhere. the issuer transaction on april 10, 2006, smart hydrogen entered into a stock purchase agreement (the &#147;issuer stock purchase agreement&#148;) with the issuer pursuant to which the issuer agreed to sell 395,000 shares of class b capital stock of the issuer, which are convertible into 39,500,000 shares of common stock, to smart hydrogen for an aggregate purchase price of us$217,250,000. each share of class b capital stock is convertible into 100 shares of common stock and the purchase price per share of common stock under the issuer stock purchase agreement, on an as-converted basis, is us$5.50. as discussed in item 3, smart hydrogen has also agreed to purchase 1,825,000 shares of common stock from dte energy foundation contemporaneously with the closing of its purchase of class b capital stock from the issuer and, in the event the purchase from dte energy foundation is not consummated prior to this closing, the issuer will have the option to sell an additional 18,250 shares of class b capital stock, convertible into 1,825,000 shares of common stock, to smart hydrogen. additionally, the issuer has agreed to sell an additional number of shares of common stock to smart hydrogen equal to 35% of the total number of shares of common stock issued under the issuer&#146;s equity incentive and employee benefit plans between april 10, 2006 and the closing date, net of any such shares reacquired by the issuer during that time period. the purchase price for these additional shares of common stock and class b capital stock on an as-converted basis will be us$5.50 per share. following the closing of these transactions, smart hydrogen is expected to own approximately 35% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis, taking into account the 2,714,700 shares of common stock of the issuer that smart hydrogen purchased from ge in december 2005 (as discussed in item 3). the funds that will be used to purchase shares of class b capital stock and common stock from the issuer will come from smart hydrogen&#146;s working capital. in the issuer stock purchase agreement, the issuer represented to smart hydrogen that, as of april 10, 2006, the issuer had 86,266,835 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. page 12 these transactions are expected to close in summer 2006, subject to approval by the issuer&#146;s shareholders, regulatory approvals, including hart-scott-rodino antitrust clearance and clearance by the committee on foreign investments in the united states, and other customary closing conditions. with respect to the shareholder approval, smart hydrogen, dte energy company and dte energy ventures, inc. have all agreed to vote in favor of the transaction pursuant to the dte foundation voting agreement and dte energy voting agreement discussed in item 3. the issuer will also be seeking a formal interpretative letter from the staff of nasdaq confirming that the terms of the class b capital stock relating to appointment of directors complies with applicable nasdaq rules, and the issuer stock purchase agreement may be terminated by either party if the issuer is unable to obtain such a letter. the issuer stock purchase agreement may also be terminated by either party if the transaction has not been completed by september 30, 2006. the issuer will also have the right to terminate the issuer stock purchase agreement if it receives a proposal that its board of directors determines to be superior (after taking into account any modifications proposed by smart hydrogen to its proposal); provided that the issuer may not solicit alternative proposals. if the issuer exercises this termination right, it must pay a termination fee of approximately us$5.4 million and reimburse up to approximately us$2.6 million of smart hydrogen&#146;s expenses. the class b capital stock that is to be sold by the issuer is a new class of stock that is economically equivalent to, and convertible into, shares of common stock. the terms of the class b capital stock will be set forth in a certificate of designations filed by the issuer with the delaware secretary of state, the form of which has been agreed to by the issuer and smart hydrogen (the &#147;certificate of designations&#148;). pursuant to the certificate of designations, the holders of the class b capital stock initially will be able to appoint up to four of the eleven directors to the issuer&#146;s board of directors, at least two of whom must be independent directors under applicable nasdaq rules. under the certificate of designations, these directors must be proportionately represented on all committees of the board of directors to the extent consistent with applicable law; provided that any committee of five or fewer members need only have one such director as a member. the number of directors that the holders of class b capital stock will be able to appoint in the future will decrease if the percentage of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock on an as converted basis decreases; provided that if this percentage decreases below 10%, the director appointment and committee representation rights will terminate. separately, in the investor rights agreement described below, the holders of the class b capital stock will agree to vote in favor of all director nominees recommended by the issuer as long as they have director appointment rights. the certificate of designations also requires the issuer to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding class b capital stock prior to taking any of the following actions as long as such holders continue to own over 20% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis: &#149; changing the number of directors on the board of directors; page 13 &#149; issuing any additional shares of class b capital stock; &#149; acquiring any business or assets if the purchase price exceeds the greater of (i) 30% of total assets of the issuer on a consolidated basis or (ii) us$105,000,000; or &#149; amending certain provisions of the issuer&#146;s certification of incorporation or by-laws relating to the rights of the class b capital stock or certain other corporate governance matters, other than in connection with a sale of the issuer. the certificate of designations also provides that shares of class b capital stock will automatically convert into common stock if they are transferred to anyone other than certain affiliates of smart hydrogen or if the holder of such shares experiences a change of control. in connection with the transaction, the parties have also agreed to enter into an investor rights agreement (the &#147;investor rights agreement&#148;) and a registration rights agreement (the &#147;registration rights agreement&#148;) at the closing of the transaction, which establish certain rights and obligations of the issuer and smart hydrogen relating to the investment. under the investor rights agreement, smart hydrogen will agree to the following restrictions on the transfer of shares of stock of the issuer: &#149; for 18 months following the closing, smart hydrogen will not transfer any equity securities of the issuer to any person; &#149; for 2 years following the closing, smart hydrogen will not privately sell any equity securities of the issuer to any person who is or will become a 5% stockholder; &#149; for 2 years following the closing, smart hydrogen will not privately sell any equity securities of the issuer to any person without providing the issuer with a right of first offer; and &#149; for 5 years following the closing, smart hydrogen will not privately sell any equity securities of the issuer to a competitor of the issuer. notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuer will permit smart hydrogen, at any time, to transfer its shares to certain affiliates of smart hydrogen or to transfer its shares pursuant to any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, restructuring, or acquisition of the issuer that is recommended by the issuer&#146;s board of directors. additionally, smart hydrogen will agree that neither it nor any of its affiliates will take certain actions for a period of 5 years following the closing, including, among others: &#149; acquiring any additional securities of the issuer (other than pursuant to the preemptive or top up rights described below); &#149; acting to propose, or solicit any person with respect to, any merger, business combination, tender or exchange offer, restructuring, recapitalization, liquidation, or similar transaction involving the issuer or to seek to control, change or influence the page 14 issuer&#146;s management, board of directors or policies, except through the exercise of the rights granted in connection with the transaction; &#149; engaging in a proxy solicitation; and &#149; submitting a director nominee (other than pursuant to their director appointment rights) or a stockholder proposal to the issuer for consideration by its stockholders. notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuer will permit the holders of class b capital stock to participate as a bidder in any process initiated by the issuer to sell the issuer and, if the issuer receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal, to submit an acquisition proposal prior to the issuer&#146;s acceptance of the unsolicited acquisition proposal. the investor rights agreement will also require the issuer, for two years following the closing, to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding class b capital stock prior to redeeming or repurchasing stock (subject to carveouts related to repurchases under equity incentive plans and from smart hydrogen under the issuer&#146;s right of first offer) or paying any dividends. in the investor rights agreement, the issuer will agree to provide the holders of class b capital stock with preemptive rights to enable them to participate in future issuances of securities by the issuer in order to maintain their percentage ownership of the issuer&#146;s total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. these preemptive rights are subject to carveouts for issuances under equity incentive or employee benefit plans, issuances in acquisitions by the issuer, issuances to strategic partners of up to 10% in the aggregate of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock as of the closing date, issuances to financial institutions or lessors in lending or leasing transactions, private offerings of up to us$7.5 million, and public offerings. however, in the event of issuances of securities in an acquisition by the issuer or under an equity incentive or employee benefit plan, the holders of class b capital stock will have top up rights enabling them to purchase additional securities in order to maintain their percentage ownership of the issuer&#146;s total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. pursuant to this top up right: &#149; if the issuer issues more than us$7.5 million of securities in an acquisition by the issuer, then the holders of class b capital stock will have the right to purchase additional securities from the issuer to maintain their percentage ownership; &#149; if the issuer issues less than us$7.5 million of securities in an acquisition by the issuer, then the issuer will have the option of either offering additional securities to the holders of class b capital stock or permitting them to purchase additional securities in the public market to maintain their percentage ownership; and &#149; if the issuer, in the aggregate, issues shares of common stock under an equity incentive or employee benefit plan during any year, then, at the beginning of the following year, the issuer will permit the holders of class b capital stock to purchase additional securities in the public market to maintain their percentage ownership. page 15 these holders may exercise these preemptive and top up rights notwithstanding the general restriction on acquisition of additional securities of the issuer described above. these preemptive and top up rights generally continue as long as the holders of class b capital stock own at least 10% of the outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. under the investor rights agreement, the issuer will also provide the holders of the class b capital stock with co-sale rights to participate on a pro rata basis in any sale by the issuer of common stock for cash in a private placement of more than 20% of the issuer&#146;s then outstanding common stock, after giving effect to such transaction, to a single purchaser. these co-sale rights generally continue as long as the holders of class b capital stock own at least 10% of the outstanding common stock of the issuer on an as-converted basis. certain affiliates of smart hydrogen will, and any person to whom shares of class b capital stock are transferred in the future (without the prior conversion of such shares into common stock) will be required to, agree to be bound by the terms of the investor rights agreement. under the registration rights agreement, the issuer will agree to register the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the class b capital stock on a resale registration statement within 18 months after the closing of the investment. the issuer will also agree to prepare a prospectus or, if the issuer is not form s-3 eligible, file a registration statement for an underwritten public offering upon the demand of the holders of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the class b capital stock; provided that the issuer is only required to accommodate up to five requests (and pay expenses for three requests). the issuer will also grant the holders unlimited piggy-back registration rights with respect to underwritten offerings being registered by the issuer. the registration rights will be transferable to a person acquiring 25% or more of the shares initially issued. the registration rights are to be subject to blackout and market standstill provisions enabling the issuer to suspend sales pursuant to the registration rights for up to, but not more than, 180 days in any 12-month period. in connection with the transaction, the issuer has stated that it has amended its by-laws effective upon and subject to the closing of the transaction. the amendments are technical amendments to reflect the rights to be granted to the holders of the class b capital stock and constitute the addition of language to article i, section 3(c); article ii, section 2; article ii, section 14; and article vi, section 8(a) of the by-laws indicating that the provisions of such sections are &#147;subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock.&#148; the transactions contemplated by the issuer
