securities and exchange commission (the &#147; commission &#148;) accepted the offers of settlement of 15 broker-dealer firms, including merrill lynch, pierce, fenner &#038; smith incorporated (&#147; mlpf&#038;s &#148;), and issued a settlement order on may 31, 2006. the commission found, and mlpf&#038;s neither admitted nor denied, that respondents (including mlpf&#038;s) violated section 17(a)(2) of the securities act of 1933 by managing auctions for auction rate securities in ways that were not adequately disclosed or that did not conform to disclosed procedures. mlpf&#038;s consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a civil money penalty, and compliance with certain undertakings. on march 13, 2006, mlpf&#038;s entered into a settlement with the commission whereby the commission alleged, and mlpf&#038;s neither admitted nor denied, that mlpf&#038;s failed to furnish promptly to representatives of the commission electronic mail communications (&#147; e-mails &#148;) as required under section 17(a) of the exchange act and rule 17a-4(j) thereunder. the commission also alleged, and mlpf&#038;s neither admitted nor denied, that merrill lynch failed to retain certain e-mails related to its business as such in violation of section 17(a) of the exchange act and rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder. pursuant to the terms of the settlement, mlpf&#038;s consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a civil money penalty of $2,500,000, and compliance with certain undertakings relating to the retention of e-mails and the prompt production of e-mails to the commission. in march 2005, merrill lynch &#038; co., inc. and certain of its affiliates (merrill lynch &#038; co., inc. and its affiliates collectively, &#147; merrill lynch &#148;) reached agreements with the state of new jersey and the new york stock exchange (the &#147; nyse &#148;) and reached an agreement in principle with the state of connecticut pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a settlement that included findings that it failed to maintain certain books and records and to reasonably supervise a team of former financial analysts (&#147; fas &#148;) who facilitated improper market timing by a hedge fund client. merrill lynch terminated the fas in october 2003, brought the matter to the attention of regulators, and cooperated fully in the regulators&#146; review. the settlement will result in aggregate payments of $13.5 million. in march 2005, merrill lynch reached an agreement in principle with the nyse pursuant to which merrill lynch, without admitting or denying the allegations, later consented to a settlement that included findings with regard to certain matters relating to the failure to deliver prospectuses for certain auction rate preferred shares and open-end mutual funds; the failure to deliver product descriptions with regard to certain exchange-traded funds; the failure to ensure that proper registration qualifications were obtained for certain personnel; issues with regard to the retention, retrieval and review of e-mails; isolated lapses in branch office supervision; late reporting of certain events such as customer complaints and arbitrations; the failure to report certain complaints in quarterly reports to the nyse due to a systems error; and partial non-compliance with continuing education requirements. the settlement resulted in a payment of $10 million to the nyse. 69 table of contents on november 3, 2004, a jury in houston, texas convicted four former merrill lynch employees of criminal misconduct in connection with a nigerian barge transaction that the government alleged helped enron inflate its 1999 earnings by $12 million. the jury also found that the transaction led to investor losses of $13.7 million. those convictions were reversed by a federal appellate court on august 1, 2006, except for one conviction against one employee based on perjury and obstruction of justice. the government has appealed the reversals. in 2003, merrill lynch agreed to pay $80 million to settle commission charges that it aided and abetted enron&#146;s fraud by engaging in two improper year-end transactions in 1999, including the nigerian barge transaction. the $80 million paid in connection with the settlement with the commission will be made available to settle investor claims. in september 2003, the united states department of justice agreed not to prosecute merrill lynch for crimes that may have been committed by its former employees related to certain transactions with enron, subject to certain understandings, including merrill lynch&#146;s continued cooperation with the department, its acceptance of responsibility for conduct of its former employees, and its agreement to adopt and implement new policies and procedures related to the integrity of client and counter-party financial statements, complex structured finance transactions and year-end transactions. on or about june 27, 2003, the attorney general for the state of west virginia brought an action against the defendants that participated in the april 28, 2003, settlement described below. the action, filed in the west virginia state court, alleged that the defendants&#146; research practices violated the west virginia consumer credit and protection act. on september 16, 2005, the circuit court of marshall county, west virginia, dismissed the case, following an earlier decision by the west virginia supreme court holding that the west virginia attorney general lacked authority to bring the claims. on april 28, 2003, the commission, nyse, national association of securities dealers, and state securities regulators announced that the settlements-in-principle that the regulators had disclosed on december 20, 2002, had been reduced to final settlements with regard to ten securities firms, including merrill lynch. on october 31, 2003, the united states district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgments in connection with the april 28, 2003 research settlements. the final settlements pertaining to merrill lynch, which involved both monetary and non-monetary relief, brought to a conclusion the regulatory actions against merrill lynch related to its research practices. merrill lynch entered into these settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and findings by the regulators, and the settlements did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceedings. 70
