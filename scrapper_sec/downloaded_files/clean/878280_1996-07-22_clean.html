as to which the holders thereof have contracted with the company for "piggyback" registration rights) so long as the inclusion in such registration of such shares will not, in the reasonable judgment of the managing underwriter(s), if any, interfere with the successful marketing in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition of all the registrable shares sought to be registered. if it is determined as provided above that there will be such interference, the other shares of common stock sought to be included shall be excluded to the extent deemed appropriate by the managing underwriter(s). 2.2. limitations on demand registrations. subject to section 2.4, the company's obligation to effect a demand registration requested by the investor pursuant to section 2.1

applicable to officers and directors of the company not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of the registrable shares for a period of up to 180 days following and 15 days prior to the date of the final prospectus contained in the registration statement filed in connection with such offering. 2.4. minimum sale availability. the limitations on the company's obligations to effect demand registrations set forth in section 2.2.3 and the investor's obligation under section 2.3 shall not be applicable to the extent that such limitations would result in the investor not having a

registration"), then the company shall give the investor written notice of its intention to do so and of the intended method of sale (the "registration notice") not fewer than 15 days prior to the anticipated filing date of the registration statement effecting such company registration. the investor may request inclusion of any registrable shares in such company registration by delivering to the company, within 10 days after receipt of the registration notice, a written notice (the "piggyback notice") -4- 5 stating the number of registrable shares proposed to be included and that such shares are to be included in any underwriting only on the same terms and conditions as the shares of common stock otherwise being sold through underwriters under such registration. the company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause all registrable shares specified in the piggyback notice to be included in the company registration and any related offering, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale by the investor of such registrable shares in accordance with the method of sale applicable to the other shares of common stock included in the company registration. 3.2. limitations on piggyback registrations. the company's obligation to include registrable shares in the company registration pursuant to section 3.1 shall be subject to the following limitations: 3.2.1. the company

(ii) pursuant to which the company is offering to exchange its own securities, or (iii) relating to dividend reinvestment plans. 3.2.2. if the managing underwriter(s), if any, of an offering related

managing underwriter(s) may exclude the appropriate number of shares of common stock held by the stockholders of the company, including the investor, from such registration. if the managing underwriter(s) determines to exclude from such offering any registrable shares that the investor desires to include or any shares of common stock that other company stockholders with applicable registration rights desire to include, the investor and such other company stockholders (except for such person or persons, if any, upon whose demand such registration is being made) shall share pro rata in the portion of such offering available to them (the "available portion"), with the investor and each such other company stockholder entitled to include in such company registration and related offering a number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (i) the available portion and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of registrable shares which the investor desires to include in such company registration (in the case of the investor) or the total number of shares of common stock which such other company stockholder desires to include in such company registration (in the case of each such other company stockholder) and the denominator of which is (x) the total of the number of registrable shares which the investor desires to include in such -5- 6 company registration plus (y) the total number of shares of common stock that such other company stockholders desire to include in such company registration. 3.3. selection of underwriter. any company registration and related offering shall be managed by the company; the company shall have the power to select the managing underwriter(s) for such offering, and shall in consultation with the managing underwriter(s) have the power to determine the offering price, the underwriting discounts and commissions, the terms of the underwriting agreement and, the timing of the registration and related offering. to the extent that the investor participates in a company registration and related offering pursuant to section 3.1, the investor shall enter into, and sell its registrable shares only

participation in the offering and to provide any assurances reasonably requested by the company and the managing underwriter(s) in that regard, or shall deliver to the company in custody certificates representing all registrable shares to be included in the registration and shall execute and deliver to the company a custody agreement and a power of attorney, each in form and substance appropriate for the purpose of effecting the investor's participation in the company registration and related offering and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the company. if the investor disapproves of the features of the company registration and related offering, the investor may withdraw therefrom (in whole or part) by written notice to the company and the managing underwriter(s) delivered no later than ten (10) days prior to the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement and the registrable shares of the investor shall thereupon be withdrawn from such registration. article 4

several, to which such investor indemnitee may become subject under the securities act, any state securities law or otherwise, -8- 9 including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such shares are registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, any summary prospectus used in connection with any securities being registered, or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) any violation by the company of the securities act or rules of the commission thereunder or any blue sky laws or any rules promulgated thereunder, and shall reimburse each such indemnitee for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, said preliminary prospectus or said prospectus or summary prospectus or said amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of the investor or any underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and provided, further, that if any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission contained in any preliminary prospectus which did not appear in the final prospectus, the company shall not have any liability with respect thereto to any investor indemnitee if any investor indemnitee delivered a copy of the preliminary prospectus to the person alleging such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and failed to deliver a copy of the final prospectus as amended or supplemented if it has been amended or supplemented, to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale to such person. 5.2. indemnification by the investor. in the event of a registration of any registrable shares pursuant to this agreement, the investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the company and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, each officer of the company who signs the registration statement, each director of the company and each underwriter and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of the securities act (each a "company indemnitee"), against any and all such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in section 5.1 if the -9- 10 statement, alleged statement, omission or alleged omission in respect of which such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability is asserted was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of a holder of registrable shares specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that if any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission contained in any preliminary prospectus which did not appear in the final prospectus, the investor shall not have any such liability with respect thereto to any company indemnitee if any company indemnitee delivered a copy of the preliminary prospectus to the person alleging much expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and failed to deliver a copy of the final prospectus, as amended or supplemented if it has been amended or supplemented, to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale to such person. 5.3. contribution. if the indemnification provided for in sections 5.1 or 5.2 above is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified parties on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party, or by the indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5.3 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities or actions in respect thereof referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or -10- 11 claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5.4. indemnification procedures. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this article 5 or to the extent that it has not been prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the company, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select one separate counsel to assert such legal defenses (in which case the indemnifying party
