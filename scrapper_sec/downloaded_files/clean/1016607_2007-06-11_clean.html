(a) the purchaser is entitled to purchase shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in this paragraph 1(a). when any adjustment is required to be made to the exercise price pursuant to section 5 below, the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, by (ii) the exercise price in effect immediately after such adjustment. (b) notwithstanding paragraph 1(a) above, the company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the number of shares of common stock that the company may issue to the purchaser without breaching the company&#146;s obligations under the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) (the &#147; exchange cap &#148;), except the limitation shall not apply in the event that the company (a) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the nasdaq global select market for issuances in excess of the exchange cap or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the purchaser. 2. the rights represented by this warrant may be exercised by the holder hereof, in whole or in part, by written notice of exercise, in the form attached hereto, delivered to the company by the surrender of this warrant (properly endorsed if required) at the principal office of the company and upon payment to it by check of the exercise price in lawful money of the united states. the company agrees that the shares of common stock so purchased shall be and are deemed to be issued to the holder hereof as the record owner of such shares of common stock as of the close of business on the date on which this warrant shall have been surrendered and payment made for such shares of common stock as aforesaid. subject to the provisions of the next succeeding paragraph, certificates for the shares of common stock so purchased shall be delivered to the holder hereof within a reasonable time, not exceeding l0 days, after the rights represented by this warrant shall have been so exercised, and, unless this warrant has expired, a new warrant representing the number of shares of common stock, if any, with respect to which this warrant shall not then have been exercised shall also be delivered to the holder hereof within such time. 3. notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the company shall not be required to deliver any certificate for shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant except in accordance with the provisions, and subject to the limitations, of paragraphs 8 and 9 hereof. 4. the company covenants and agrees that all shares of common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant will, upon issuance as set forth above, be duly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. the company further covenants and agrees that during the period within which the rights -2- represented by this warrant may be exercised, the company will at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of issue or transfer upon exercise of the subscription rights evidenced by this warrant, a sufficient number of shares of common stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant. 5. the above provisions are, however, subject to this paragraph 5. notwithstanding anything in this paragraph 5 to the contrary, no change in the exercise price shall be made until the cumulative effect of the adjustments called for by this paragraph 5 since the date of the last change in the exercise price would change the exercise price by more than 1%. however, once the cumulative effect would result in such a change, then the exercise price shall be changed to reflect all adjustments called for by this paragraph 5 and not previously made. subject to the foregoing, the exercise price shall be adjusted from time to time as set forth in this paragraph 5. if the occurrence of an event would cause the exercise price to be adjusted by more than one subsection of this section 5, then the exercise price shall be adjusted once pursuant to the subsection that would provide the greatest dollar amount decrease in the exercise price. (a) adjustments to exercise price for consolidation, merger, etc . in case of any consolidation or merger of the company with any other entity (other than a wholly owned subsidiary of the company), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, or in case of any share exchange pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of common stock are converted into other securities or property, the company shall, prior to or at the time of such transaction, make appropriate provision or cause appropriate provision to be made so that the purchaser shall have the right thereafter to exercise this warrant into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such this warrant could have been exercised immediately prior to the effective date of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. if in connection with any such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to elect to receive either securities, cash or other assets upon completion of such transaction, the company shall provide or cause to be provided to the purchaser the right to elect the securities, cash or other assets for which this warrant shall be exercisable after completion of any such transaction on the same terms and subject to the same conditions applicable to holders of the common stock (including, without limitation, notice of the right to elect, limitations on the period in which such election shall be made and the effect of failing to exercise the election).

(c) adjustments to exercise price for diluting issues . (i) certain definitions . for purposes of this paragraph 5, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) &#147; additional shares of common stock &#148; shall mean all shares of common stock issued by the company or deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 5(c)(ii) below (including shares of common stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the company) after the date hereof. (b) &#147; business day &#148; shall mean any day except saturday, sunday or federal legal holiday, and any other day on which the trading market (as defined below) is closed. (c) &#147; convertible security &#148; shall mean any evidence of indebtedness, share or other security directly or indirectly convertible or exchangeable into or for common stock, excluding options. (d) &#147; option &#148; shall mean any option, warrant, right or security to purchase or otherwise acquire common stock or convertible securities. -4- (e) &#147; trading market &#148; means whichever of the new york stock exchange, the american stock exchange, the nasdaq global select market, the nasdaq global market, the nasdaq capital market or the otc bulletin board on which the common stock is listed or quoted for trading on the date in question. (ii) additional shares of common stock deemed to be issued . (a) if after the date hereof, the company shall issue or sell any options or convertible securities, or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities, then the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date. (b) if the terms of any option or convertible security, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to the terms of this subparagraph 5(c), are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such option or convertible security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such option or convertible security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any such option or convertible security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the company upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the exercise price computed upon the original issue of such option or convertible security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such exercise price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such option or convertible security. notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (b) shall have the effect of increasing the exercise price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (x) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such option or convertible security, or (y) the exercise price that would have resulted from any issuances of additional shares of common stock (other than deemed issuances of additional shares of common stock as a result of the issuance of such option or convertible security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. (c) if the terms of any option or convertible security, the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to the terms of this subparagraph 5(c) (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to subparagraph 5(c)(iii)) of the additional shares of common stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the exercise price then in effect and the then current market price, or because such option or convertible security was issued before the date hereof), are revised after the date hereof as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the -5- provisions of such option or convertible security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such option or convertible security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such option or convertible security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the company upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such option or convertible security, as so amended or adjusted, and the additional shares of common stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in subparagraph 5(c)(ii)) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective. (d) upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised option or unconverted or unexchanged convertible security (or portion thereof) which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to the terms of subparagraphs 5(c)(iv) or (v), the exercise price shall be readjusted to such exercise price as would have obtained had such option or convertible security (or portion thereof) never been issued. (e) if the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any option or convertible security, or the consideration payable to the company upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such option or convertible security is issued or amended but is subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the exercise price provided for in this subparagraph 5(c)(ii) shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this subparagraph 5(c)(ii)). if the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any option or convertible security, or the consideration payable to the company upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such option or convertible security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the exercise price that would result under the terms of this subparagraph 5(c)(ii) at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the exercise price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made. (iii) determination of consideration . for purposes of this paragraph 5, the consideration received by the company for the issue of any additional shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) cash and property : such consideration shall: (1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the company, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest; -6- (2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company; and (3) in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the company for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received for the additional shares of common stock, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. (b) options and convertible securities . the consideration per share received by the company for additional shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to subparagraph 5(c)(ii), relating to options and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing: (1) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the company upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, by (2) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (iv) issues below current market price . (a) in case the company shall issue or sell or, or is deemed to have issued or sold pursuant to subparagraph 5(c)(ii) above, additional shares of common stock for consideration per share less than the average of the daily last sales price of the common stock on the trading market as reported by bloomberg financial markets, or a comparable reporting service (the &#147; closing price &#148;) for the 10 consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (the &#147; current market price &#148;), then in each such case the exercise price in effect on such record date shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: where -7- e 1 = the adjusted exercise price. e = the current exercise price. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (for which purpose the shares of common stock outstanding shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, and (2) the number of shares of common stock into which any other outstanding securities of the company are then issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities other than the &#147;warrants&#148; (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)). n = the number of additional shares of common stock issued, or deemed to have been issued. p = the consideration per share of the additional shares of common stock issued or deemed to have been issued. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the date of such issuance. (b) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date of issuance, or deemed issuance, of such common stock. (v) issues below exercise price . (a) in case the company shall issue or sell or, or is deemed to have issued or sold pursuant to subparagraph 5(c)(ii) above, additional shares of common stock for consideration per share less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issue, then in each such case the exercise price in effect on such issuance date shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: where e 1 = the adjusted exercise price. e = the current exercise price. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (for which purpose the shares of common stock outstanding shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, and (2) the number of shares of common stock into which any other outstanding securities of the company are then issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities other than the &#147;warrants&#148; (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)). n = the number of additional shares of common issued, or deemed to have -8- been issued. p = the consideration per share of the additional shares of common stock issued, or deemed to have been issued. (b) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date of issuance, or deemed issuance, of such common stock. (d) adjustments to exercise price for certain distributions . (i) in case the company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of its indebtedness (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) or assets (including securities, but excluding (a) any options or convertible securities, and (b) any dividend or distribution paid in cash out of the retained earnings of the company and any dividend or distribution referred to in subparagraph 5(b) above), then in each such case the exercise price then in effect shall be adjusted as of the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution in accordance with the formula: where e 1 = the adjusted exercise price. e = the current exercise price. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the ex-dividend date for such distribution. f = the amount of such cash dividend and/or the fair market value on such ex-dividend date of the assets, securities, rights or warrants to be distributed divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such ex-dividend date. the board of directors of the company shall determine in good faith such fair market value. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall m - f be deemed to be less than zero. m (ii) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the ex-dividend date with respect to such dividend or distribution. (e) all calculations of adjustments hereunder shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100 of a share, as the case may be. -9- (f) in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to subparagraph (a) or (b) above, the purchaser shall, upon any exercise of this warrant, become entitled to receive securities, cash or assets other than common stock, the number or amount of such securities or property so receivable upon such exercise shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (d) above. (g) whenever the exercise price is adjusted as herein provided, the company shall send to each transfer agent for the common stock, and to the trading market, a statement signed by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer or any vice president of the company and if required by the trading market by its treasurer, its secretary or its assistant secretary stating the adjusted exercise price determined as provided in this paragraph 5; and any adjustment so evidenced, given in good faith, shall be binding upon all shareholders and upon the company. whenever the exercise price is adjusted, the company shall give prompt notice to the holder hereof by mail, setting forth the adjustment and the new exercise price. notwithstanding the foregoing notice provisions, failure by the company to give such notice or a defect in such notice shall not affect the binding nature of such corporate action of the company. (h) whenever the company shall propose to take any of the actions specified in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of this paragraph 5 which would result in any adjustment in the exercise price, the company shall cause a notice to be mailed at least 10 days prior to the date on which the books of the company will close or on which a record will be taken for such action to the holder of record of this warrant on the date of such notice. such notice shall specify the action proposed to be taken by the company and the date as of which holders of record of the common stock shall participate in any such actions or be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property, as the case may be. failure by the company to give such notice or any defect in such notice shall not affect the validity of the transaction. (i) notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph 5, no adjustment in the exercise price need be made (a) for issuances of (1) conversion shares or warrant shares (as such terms are defined in the securities purchase agreement) or (2) common stock or convertible securities actually issued upon the exercise of options or shares of common stock actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of convertible securities, in each case provided such issuance is pursuant to the terms of such option or convertible security; (b) for issuances of shares of common stock, options or convertible securities issued as a dividend or distribution on series a preferred stock (as defined in the securities purchase agreement); (c) for sales of common stock pursuant to a plan for reinvestment of dividends on common stock, provided that the purchase price in any such sale is at least equal to 95% of the market price of the common stock at the time of such sales; or (d) for sales of common stock pursuant to any plan adopted by the company for the benefit of its employees or consultants, provided that such plan has been approved by the company&#146;s independent directors, or pursuant to any plan for the benefit of the company&#146;s directors, provided that such plan has been approved by the company&#146;s shareholders. -10- (j) if any event occurs as to which in the opinion of the board of directors of the company the other provisions of this paragraph 5 are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the purchase rights of the holder of this warrant or of common stock in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the board of directors of the company shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid; provided, however, that the members of the board of directors of the company shall not be liable to the holders hereof for any such determination made in good faith. (k) no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon the exercise of this warrant, but, instead the company shall round such fraction of a share of common stock to the nearest whole share, except that if the fraction is one-half or greater, the company shall round the fraction up to the nearest whole share. 6. as used herein, the term &#147; common stock &#148; shall mean and include the company&#146;s presently authorized common stock and shall also include any capital stock of any class of the company hereafter authorized which shall not be limited to a fixed sum or percentage in respect of the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends or in the distribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company; provided that the shares purchasable pursuant to this warrant shall include shares designated as common stock of the company on the date of original issue of this warrant or, in the case of any reclassification of the outstanding shares thereof, the stock, securities, cash or assets provided for in paragraph 5(a) above. 7. this warrant shall not entitle the holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the company. 8. (a) the holder of this warrant acknowledges that neither this warrant nor, as of the date of the original issuance of this warrant, any of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise hereof have been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the &#147; act &#148;), or any state securities laws and that this warrant or such shares of common stock may only be transferred in accordance with this paragraph 8. the holder of this warrant, by acceptance hereof, represents that it has acquired this warrant for investment and not with a view to distribution of this warrant or the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise hereof within the meaning of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) optional redemption by the corporation . to the extent permitted by law and the terms or provisions of other agreements or instruments for or with respect to capital stock or indebtedness of the corporation to which the corporation is, or may become, a party or subject (including without limitation any notes, debentures or indentures), the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock shall be redeemable beginning on june 1, 2010, at the option of the corporation, in whole at any time, out of legally available funds if (a) the last reported sale price for a share of common stock on the principal market during each trading day of the 30-day period (the &#147; measurement period &#148;) ending immediately prior to the date of the optional redemption notice (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $3.75 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications); and (b) the corporation shall have filed a registration statement on form s-3 under the securities act covering all shares of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock or exercise of the warrants, and such registration statement shall have been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission and no stop order or other suspension of effectiveness with respect to such registration statement shall have been 8 received by the corporation. redemptions shall be made at the per share redemption price. not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the redemption date, notice (the &#147; optional redemption notice &#148;) by first class mail, postage prepaid, shall be given to the holders of record of the series a preferred stock to be redeemed, addressed to such shareholders at their last addresses as shown on the stock books of the corporation. each such optional redemption notice shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates representing the shares of series a preferred stock, and that on and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on such shares. on or after the date fixed for redemption as stated in the optional redemption notice, each holder of the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares to the corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall thereupon be entitled to receive payment of the redemption price. if fewer than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate or certificates are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. if, on the date fixed for redemption, funds necessary for the redemption shall be available therefor and shall have been irrevocably deposited or set aside, then, notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any shares so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, the dividends with respect to the shares so called shall cease to accumulate on and after the date fixed for redemption, such shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding, the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders, and all rights whatsoever with respect to such shares (except the right of the holders thereof to receive the redemption price without interest upon surrender of their certificates) shall terminate. section 7. conversion at option of holders . (a) holders of series a preferred stock may, at their option upon surrender of the certificates therefor, convert any or all of their shares of series a preferred stock into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (and such other securities and property as they may be entitled to, as hereinafter provided) at any time after issuance thereof; provided, that such conversion right shall expire at the close of business on the date, if any, fixed for the redemption of series a preferred stock in any notice of redemption given pursuant to section 6 hereof if there is no default in payment of the redemption price. each share of series a preferred stock shall be convertible at the office of any transfer agent for the series a preferred stock, and at such other office or offices, if any, as the board of directors may designate, into that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share) as shall be equal to the conversion rate, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. shares of series a preferred stock may initially be converted into full shares of common stock at the rate of 666.6667 shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred stock, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in section 8 (such conversion rate, as so adjusted from time to time, being referred to herein as the &#147; conversion rate &#148;). the 9 &#147; conversion price &#148; shall be equal to stated amount per share divided by the conversion rate, or initially $1.50, subject to adjustment in proportion to any adjustments to the conversion rate. upon conversion, holders of series a preferred stock shall receive in respect of any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series a preferred stock surrendered for conversion a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock that would have been issued if the accumulated and unpaid dividends in the form of series a preferred stock would have been converted at the same time. (b) in order to effect a conversion, a holder shall: (i) fax (or otherwise deliver) a copy of the fully executed notice of conversion, attached hereto as schedule a, to the corporation (attention: secretary) and (ii) surrender or cause to be surrendered the original certificates representing the series a preferred stock being converted (the &#147; preferred stock certificates &#148;), duly endorsed, along with a copy of the notice of conversion as soon as practicable thereafter to the corporation. upon receipt by the corporation of a facsimile copy of a notice of conversion from a holder, the corporation shall promptly send, via facsimile, a confirmation to such holder stating that the notice of conversion has been received, the date upon which the corporation expects to deliver the common stock issuable upon such conversion and the name and telephone number of a contact person at the corporation regarding the conversion. the corporation shall not be obligated to issue shares of common stock upon a conversion unless either the preferred stock certificates are delivered to the corporation as provided above, or the holder notifies the corporation that such preferred stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and delivers satisfactory evidence of loss to the corporation and indemnification or a bond, in each case in a form reasonably satisfactory to the corporation. (c) upon the surrender of preferred stock certificates accompanied by a notice of conversion, the corporation (itself, or through its transfer agent) shall, no later than the later of (a) the second business day following the conversion date specified in the notice of conversion and (b) the business day following the date of such surrender (the &#147; delivery period &#148;), issue and deliver (i.e., deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier service postage prepaid) to the holder or its nominee (x) that number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of series a preferred stock being converted and (y) a certificate representing the number of shares of series a preferred stock not being converted, if any. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation&#146;s transfer agent is participating in the depository trust company (&#147; dtc &#148;) fast automated securities transfer program, and so long as the certificates therefor do not bear a legend (pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement) and the holder thereof is not then required to return such certificate for the placement of a legend thereon (pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement), the corporation shall cause its transfer agent to promptly electronically transmit the common stock issuable upon conversion to the holder by crediting the account of the holder or its nominee with dtc through its deposit withdrawal agent commission system (&#147; dtc transfer &#148;). if the aforementioned conditions to a dtc transfer are not satisfied, the corporation shall deliver as provided above to the holder physical certificates representing the common stock issuable upon conversion. further, a holder may instruct 10 the corporation to deliver to the holder physical certificates representing the common stock issuable upon conversion in lieu of delivering such shares by way of dtc transfer. (d) if, at any time, (i) a holder of shares of series a preferred stock submits a notice of conversion and the corporation fails for any reason (other than because such issuance would exceed such holder&#146;s allocated portion of the exchange cap) to deliver, on or prior to the fifth business day following the expiration of the delivery period for such conversion, such number of shares of common stock to which such holder is entitled upon such conversion, or (ii) the corporation provides written notice to any holder of series a preferred stock (or makes a public announcement via press release) at any time of its intention not to issue shares of common stock, which shares shall be subject to an effective registration statement, upon exercise by any holder of its conversion rights in accordance with the terms of this certificate (other than because such issuance would exceed such holder&#146;s allocated portion of the exchange cap) (each of (i) and (ii) being a &#147; conversion default &#148;), then the holder may elect, at any time thereafter, to have all or any portion of such holder&#146;s outstanding shares of series a preferred stock redeemed by the corporation for cash, at an amount per share equal to the redemption price. (e) a number of shares of the authorized but unissued common stock sufficient to provide for the conversion of the series a preferred stock outstanding upon the basis hereinbefore provided shall at all times be reserved by the corporation, free from preemptive rights, for such conversion, subject to the provisions of the next paragraph. if the corporation shall issue any securities or make any change in its capital structure which would change the number of shares of common stock into which each share of the series a preferred stock shall be convertible as herein provided, the corporation shall at the same time also make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of common stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding series a preferred stock on the new basis. the corporation shall comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of the series a preferred stock and shall use its best efforts to list such shares on the principal market. (f) upon the surrender of certificates representing shares of series a preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer as provided above, the person converting such shares shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the common stock issuable upon such conversion, and all rights with respect to the shares surrendered shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the common stock or other securities, cash or other assets as herein provided. (g) the corporation shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the number of shares of common stock that the corporation may issue to the holder of the shares of series a preferred stock to be converted without breaching the corporation&#146;s obligations under the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market (the &#147; exchange cap &#148;), except the limitation shall 11 not apply in the event that the corporation (a) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of the nasdaq global select market for issuances in excess of the exchange cap or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the corporation that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the holder of the series a preferred stock to be converted. section 8. adjustments to conversion rate . notwithstanding anything in this section 8 to the contrary, no change in the conversion rate shall be made until the cumulative effect of the adjustments called for by this section 8 since the date of the last change in the conversion rate would change the conversion rate by more than 1%. however, once the cumulative effect would result in such a change, then the conversion rate shall be changed to reflect all adjustments called for by this section 8 and not previously made. subject to the foregoing, the conversion rate shall be adjusted from time to time as set forth in this section 8. if the occurrence of an event would cause the conversion rate to be adjusted by more than one subsection of this section 8, then the conversion rate shall be adjusted only once pursuant to the subsection that would provide the greatest share increase in the conversion rate. (a) adjustments to conversion rate for consolidation, merger, etc . in case of any consolidation or merger of the corporation with any other entity (other than a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation, or in case of any share exchange pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of common stock are converted into other securities or property, the corporation shall, prior to or at the time of such transaction, make appropriate provision or cause appropriate provision to be made so that holders of each share of series a preferred stock then outstanding shall have the right thereafter to convert such share of series a preferred stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series a preferred stock could have been converted immediately prior to the effective date of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. if in connection with any such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to elect to receive either securities, cash or other assets upon completion of such transaction, the corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to each holder of series a preferred stock the right to elect the securities, cash or other assets into which the series a preferred stock held by such holder shall be convertible after completion of any such transaction on the same terms and subject to the same conditions applicable to holders of the common stock (including, without limitation, notice of the right to elect, limitations on the period in which such election shall be made and the effect of failing to exercise the election). (b) adjustments to conversion rate for stock splits, reclassifications, and certain distributions . in case the corporation shall: (i) pay a dividend or make a distribution on its common stock in shares of its capital stock; 12 (ii) subdivide its outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares; (iii) combine the shares of its outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issue by reclassification of its common stock any shares of its capital stock, then in each such case the conversion rate in effect immediately prior thereto shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any series a preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the number and kind of shares of capital stock of the corporation which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of such event had such series a preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the record date for such event (or if no record date is established in connection with such event, the effective date for such action). an adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (b) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a stock dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (c) adjustments to conversion rate for diluting issues . (i) certain definitions . for purposes of this section 8, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) &#147; additional shares of common stock &#148; shall mean all shares of common stock issued by the corporation or deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 8(c)(ii) below (including shares of common stock subsequently reacquired or retired by the corporation) after the series a original issue date (as defined below). (b) &#147; convertible security &#148; shall mean any evidence of indebtedness, share or other security directly or indirectly convertible or exchangeable into or for common stock, excluding options. (c) &#147; option &#148; shall mean any option, warrant, right or security to purchase or otherwise acquire common stock or convertible securities. (d) &#147; series a original issue date &#148; shall mean the date on which the first share of series a preferred stock was issued. (ii) additional shares of common stock deemed to be issued . (a) if after the series a original issue date, the corporation shall issue or sell any options or convertible securities, or shall fix a record date 13 for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such options or convertible securities, then the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or, in the case of convertible securities and options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date. (b) if the terms of any option or convertible security, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to the terms of this subparagraph 8(c), are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such option or convertible security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such option or convertible security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any such option or convertible security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the conversion rate computed upon the original issue of such option or convertible security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such conversion rate as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such option or convertible security. notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (b) shall have the effect of increasing the conversion rate to an amount which exceeds the lower of (x) the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such option or convertible security, or (y) the conversion rate that would have resulted from any issuances of additional shares of common stock (other than deemed issuances of additional shares of common stock as a result of the issuance of such option or convertible security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. (c) if the terms of any option or convertible security, the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to the terms of this subparagraph 8(c) (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to subparagraph 8(c)(iii)) of the additional shares of common stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the conversion rate then in effect and the then current market price, or because such option or convertible security was issued before the series a original issue date), are revised after the series a original issue date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such option or convertible security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such option or convertible security) to 14 provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such option or convertible security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such option or convertible security, as so amended or adjusted, and the additional shares of common stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in subparagraph 8(c)(ii)) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective. (d) upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised option or unconverted or unexchanged convertible security (or portion thereof) which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to the terms of subparagraphs 8(c)(iv) or (v), the conversion rate shall be readjusted to such conversion rate as would have obtained had such option or convertible security (or portion thereof) never been issued. (e) if the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any option or convertible security, or the consideration payable to the corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such option or convertible security is issued or amended but is subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the conversion rate provided for in this subparagraph 8(c)(ii) shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this subparagraph 8(c)(ii)). if the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any option or convertible security, or the consideration payable to the corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such option or convertible security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the conversion rate that would result under the terms of this subparagraph 8(c)(ii) at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the conversion rate that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made. (iii) determination of consideration . for purposes of this section 8, the consideration received by the corporation for the issue of any additional shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) cash and property : such consideration shall: (1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest; 15 (2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation; and (3) in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation. (b) options and convertible securities . the consideration per share received by the corporation for additional shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to subparagraph 8(c)(ii), relating to options and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing: (1) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the corporation upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, by (2) the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, or in the case of options for convertible securities, the exercise of such options for convertible securities and the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (iv) issues below current market price . (a) in case the corporation shall issue or sell or, or is deemed to have issued or sold pursuant to subparagraph 8(c)(ii) above, additional shares of common stock for consideration per share less than the average of the daily last sales price of the common stock on the principal market as reported by bloomberg financial markets, or a comparable reporting service (the &#147; closing price &#148;) for the 10 consecutive business days ending on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (the &#147; current market price &#148;), then in each such case the conversion rate in effect on such record date shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 16 where c 1 = the adjusted conversion rate. c = the current conversion rate. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (for which purpose the shares of common stock outstanding shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, and (2) the number of shares of common stock into which any other outstanding securities of the corporation are then issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities other than the warrants (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)). n = the number of additional shares of common stock issued, or deemed to have been issued. p = the consideration per share of the additional shares of common stock issued or deemed to have been issued. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the date of such issuance. (b) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date of issuance, or deemed issuance, of such common stock. (v) issues below conversion price . (a) in case the corporation shall issue or sell or, or is deemed to have issued or sold pursuant to subparagraph 8(c)(ii) above, additional shares of common stock for consideration per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such issue, then in each such case the conversion rate in effect on such issuance date shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: 17 where c 1 = the adjusted conversion rate. c = the current conversion rate. o = the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the business day immediately preceding the date of such issuance (for which purpose the shares of common stock outstanding shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, and (2) the number of shares of common stock into which any other outstanding securities of the corporation are then issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities other than the warrants (as defined in the securities purchase agreement)). n = the number of additional shares of common issued, or deemed to have been issued. cp = the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the issuance. p = the consideration per share of the additional shares of common stock issued, or deemed to have been issued. (b) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date of issuance, or deemed issuance, of such common stock. (d) adjustments to conversion rate for certain distributions . (i) in case the corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding (a) any options or convertible securities, and (b) any dividend or distribution paid in cash out of the retained earnings of the corporation and any dividend or distribution referred to in subparagraph 8(b) above), then in each such case the conversion rate then in effect shall be adjusted as of the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution in accordance with the formula: where c 1 = the adjusted conversion rate. c = the current conversion rate. m = the current market price per share of common stock on the ex-dividend date for such distribution. f = the amount of such cash dividend and/or the fair market value on such ex-dividend date of the assets, securities, rights or warrants to be distributed divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such ex-dividend date. the board of directors of the corporation shall determine in good faith such fair market value. 18 notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall m be deemed to be less than zero. m -f (ii) such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the ex-dividend date with respect to such dividend or distribution. (e) all calculations of adjustments hereunder shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100 of a share, as the case may be. (f) in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to subparagraph (a) or (b) above, the holder of any series a preferred stock shall, upon conversion of such series a preferred stock, become entitled to receive securities, cash or assets other than common stock, the number or amount of such securities or property so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (d) above. (g) whenever the conversion rate is adjusted as herein provided, the corporation shall send to each transfer agent for the series a preferred stock and the common stock, and to the principal market, a statement signed by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer or any vice president of the corporation and if required by the principal market by its treasurer, its secretary or its assistant secretary stating the adjusted conversion rate determined as provided in this section 8; and any adjustment so evidenced, given in good faith, shall be binding upon all shareholders and upon the corporation. whenever the conversion rate is adjusted, the corporation shall give notice by mail at the time of, and together with, the next dividend payment to the holders of record of series a preferred stock, setting forth the adjustment and the new conversion rate and conversion price. notwithstanding the foregoing notice provisions, failure by the corporation to give such notice or a defect in such notice shall not affect the binding nature of such corporate action of the corporation. (h) whenever the corporation shall propose to take any of the actions specified in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of this section 8 which would result in any adjustment in the conversion rate, the corporation shall cause a notice to be mailed at least 30 days prior to the date on which the books of the corporation will close or on which a record will be taken for such action to the holders of record of the outstanding series a preferred stock on the date of such notice. such notice shall specify the action proposed to be taken by the corporation and the date as of which holders of record of the common stock shall participate in any such actions or be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property, as the case may be. failure by the corporation to give such notice or any defect in such notice shall not affect the validity of the transaction.
