10 &#160; claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement; provided , however , that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to the indemnified party hereunder (except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure).&#160; if notice of commencement of any such action is given&#160;to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own&#160;expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party.&#160; each indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable and documented out&#8209;of&#8209;pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i)&#160;the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii)&#160;the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii)&#160;the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (x)&#160;representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y)&#160;there may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party.&#160; in any of such cases, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable and documented out&#8209;of&#8209;pocket fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such reasonable and documented out&#8209;of&#8209;pocket fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred.&#160; no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.&#160; no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of such indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. 7.4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the relative faults of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action.&#160; the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or &#160; 11 &#160; settlements in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth herein, any reasonable and documented out&#8209;of&#8209;pocket legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided , that the total amount to be contributed by any holder shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such holder in the offering.&#160; the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or&#160;by&#160;any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.&#160; no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section&#160;11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7.5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; survival . the obligations of the company and holders under this section&#160;7 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this agreement. 8. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; no registration rights to third parties . without the prior consent of the holders of seventy-five percent (75%) of the registrable securities then outstanding, the company covenants and agrees that it shall not grant, or cause or permit to be created, for the benefit of any person or entity any registration rights of any kind (whether similar to the demand, &#8220;piggyback&#8221; or form s-3 or form f-3 registration rights described in this schedule 1, or otherwise) relating to any securities of the company, other than rights that are subordinate in right to the holders or the registration rights already granted under the 2009 shareholders agreement or the 2012 shareholders agreement. 9. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; assignment. the registration rights under this schedule 1 may be transferred or assigned to any transferee of the registrable securities. &#160; 12 &#160;
