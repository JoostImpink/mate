is hereby agreed as follows: 1. board of directors ------------------ 1.1 following both (i) acquisition by mivtach of ordinary shares of the company upon full conversion of its debt under the convertible note, and (ii) notice by mivtach within twenty four (24) months from the consummation of the cn&w agreement (the "conversion period") that this agreement is effective, the shareholders hereby agree to vote all of the ordinary shares now or hereafter owned by them, for the election to the company's board of directors of: (i) two members designated by mivtach, one of whom shall be nominated chairman, (ii) one member designated by nir alon, (iii) one member designated by elbit, (iv) one member designated by ms and (iv) subject to applicable law, two external directors whom the parties shall mutually recommend, provided that the designating shareholder continues to hold or, with regards to ms, has the proxy to vote, 7.5% or more of the company's issued share capital on a fully diluted basis (the "7.5% threshold"). notwithstanding the foregoing, a reduction in a shareholder's holdings below the 7.5% threshold shall not be deemed to have occurred unless such reduction results from such shareholder or, with regards to ms, ms or a holder of remaining shares, selling ordinary shares of the company. if a shareholder fails to meet the 7.5% threshold (the "decreasing shareholder"), such decreasing shareholder's right to nominate directors to the board of directors shall be terminated and the right to nominate the same number of directors owned by the decreasing shareholder shall be granted to the shareholder who at such time shall hold the largest number of shares of the company. a fully diluted basis in this agreement shall mean - a theoretical increase of the company's issued share capital assuming the exercise and/or conversion of the convertible note, the warrant and all outstanding securities, options and warrants exercisable into shares of the company. remaining shares in this agreement shall mean - 1,080,944 shares of the company held by s.r. master investment (2002) ltd., 700,540 shares of the company held by r.d. master investment (2002) ltd. and 182, 405 shares of the company held by avner shacham. 1,963,889 company's shares in total. 1.2 following both (i) expiration of the conversion period without mivtach's having converted the debt under the convertible note into ordinary shares of the company, and (ii) notice by mivtach prior to the expiration of the conversion period that this agreement is effective, the shareholders hereby agree to vote all of the ordinary shares now or hereafter owned by them, for the election to the company's board of directors of: (i) two members designated by nir alon, one of whom shall be nominated chairman, (ii) one member designated by mivtach, (iii) one member designated by elbit, (iv) one member designated by ms and (iv) subject to applicable law, two external directors whom the parties shall mutually recommend, provided that the designating shareholder continues to hold or, with regards to ms, has the proxy to vote, 5% or more of the company's issued share capital on a fully diluted basis (the "5% threshold"). notwithstanding the foregoing, a reduction in a shareholder's holdings below the 5% threshold shall not be deemed to have occurred unless such reduction results from such shareholder or, with regards to ms, ms or a holder of remaining shares (as this term is defined in the spa), selling ordinary shares of the company. if a shareholder fails to meet the 5% threshold (the "decreasing shareholder"), such decreasing shareholder's right to nominate directors to the board of directors shall be terminated and the right to nominate the same number of directors owned by the decreasing shareholder shall be granted to the shareholder who at such time shall hold the largest number of shares of the company. 1.3 notwithstanding the foregoing, it is further agreed

director to the company's board pursuant to sections 1.1 and 1.2 above. 1.4 for the purpose of applying the 7.5% threshold or 5% threshold to ms, it is agreed that ms shall be considered to be the holder of all ordinary shares of the company which are either held by ms or are remaining shares in respect of which ms shall be granted a proxy by such other shareholders to exercise their voting rights. 1.5 no shareholder, or any officer, director, shareholder or employee of such shareholder, makes any representation or warranty as to the fitness or competence of the nominee of any other shareholder to the company's board of directors by virtue of its execution of this agreement or by voting in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. for the avoidance of doubt, each shareholder (and the directors designated by it) shall be solely responsible for its compliance or the compliance of its designee(s) with the requirements and provisions of applicable law. 1.6 the voting of ordinary shares of the company pursuant to this agreement may be effected in person, by proxy, by written consent or in any other manner permitted by applicable law. 1.7 in the event of any share split, share dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or combination, the provisions of this agreement shall apply also to any ordinary shares issued to the shareholders with respect to, or in replacement of, their existing shareholdings in the company. 2. right of first offer; tag-along ------------------------------- 2.1. any shareholder (the "selling party") wishing to sell or otherwise transfer ordinary shares of the company to a person or entity who is not a permitted transferee, as defined hereinafter, shall be required to first make an offer to the other shareholders (each an "offeree"), as set forth below. 2.2. the selling party shall send each offeree a written offer in which the selling party shall specify the following information (the "offer"): (i) the number of ordinary shares that the selling party proposes to sell or transfer (the "offered shares"); (ii) a representation and warranty that the offered shares are free and clear of all pledges, debts, security interests and other third party interests; and (iii) the price that the selling party intends to receive in respect of the offered shares, which shall be stated in cash, together with the requested terms of payment thereof. the offer shall constitute an irrevocable offer made by the selling party to sell to each offeree the offered shares or to have such offeree participate in such sale, on a pro rata basis all upon the terms specified in the offer and as described below. for the purpose of this section 2, the pro-rata portion of each offeree shall mean a fraction of the offered shares of which the aggregate number of shares which are held by such offeree immediately prior to the offer, on an outstanding basis, shall be the numerator, and the aggregate number of shares which are held at that time by all the offerees, on an outstanding basis shall be the denominator. 2.3. if the offer specifies that it is contingent upon the purchase of all of the offered shares, the selling party shall be entitled to refuse to transfer the ordinary shares pursuant to the offer to an offeree if, following compliance with section 2.5 below, the offerees do not wish to purchase all of the offered shares. 2.4. each offeree will notify the selling party whether it (i) wishes to purchase all or any portion of such offeree's pro-rata portion of the offered shares, (ii) wishes to participate in the sale to the third party, or (ii) does not wish to either purchase the offered shares or participate in the sale thereof. such offeree response must be received by the selling party within ten (10) days after receipt of the offer by such offeree ("offeree's notice"). 2.5. if the aggregate number of offered shares accepted by the offerees is less than the number of offered shares, then the selling party shall send a notice to the offerees who accepted to purchase all the shares offered to them that shall state the number of offered shares for which no acceptances were delivered ("notice of remaining offered shares"). the offerees who received a notice of remaining offered shares, may exercise an option to purchase any of the offered shares for which no acceptances were delivered upon the terms of the offer. acceptances for purchasing remaining offered shares must be received by the selling party within ten (10) days after receipt by the relevant offerees of the notice of remaining offered shares. 2.6. if the number of offered shares for which there are acceptances is, in the aggregate, equal to the number of offered shares, then each of the accepting offerees shall acquire the number of shares for which he delivered notice of acceptance. 2.7. if the number of offered shares for which there are acceptances is, in the aggregate, more than the number of offered shares, then each of the accepting offerees shall acquire the number of shares for which he delivered notice of acceptance, and each offeree who sent acceptance to the notice of remaining offered shares (the "accepting offeree") shall acquire such number of the remaining offered shares that is equal to the remaining offered shares multiplied by a fraction in which the number of shares held by such accepting offeree immediately prior to the offer, on an outstanding basis, shall be numerator, and the aggregate number of shares which are held at that time by all accepting offerees on an outstanding basis shall be the denominator. 2.8. the offered shares shall become the property of each offeree who agreed to purchase the offered shares on the terms specified in the offer, against payment of the consideration as specified in the offer. if there remain any ordinary shares that have not been acquired by an offeree and the selling party has not exercised its right to refuse to transfer any of the offered shares pursuant to the offer (as set forth in section 2.3), then subject to the offeree's right under section 2.9 below, the selling party may sell such remaining ordinary shares or, if it has exercised its right under section 2.3, all offered shares to a third party, provided that such sale is consummated (i) in a bona fide transaction; (ii) at a price that is not lower than that specified in the offer; (iii) subject to payment terms that are no more favorable to the purchaser than those specified in the offer, all within a 90 day period from the expiry of the ten (10) day period; and (iv) provided that, if the sale is not carried out on the market and the transferee following such purchase will hold shares representing three percent (3%) or more of the company's issued and outstanding share capital, the transferee of the offered shares shall become party to this agreement. 2.9. if an offeree wishes to sell or otherwise transfer any or all of such offeree's ordinary shares together with the offered shares being sold by the selling party, such offeree (the "tag along shareholder") shall, during such 10 day period, have the right to notify the selling party of its intention to exercise its tag along right pursuant to this section 2.9 (the "tag along notice"). following the tag along notice, the tag along shareholder shall add to the ordinary shares being sold by the selling party to such proposed purchaser thereof (the "proposed purchaser") that number of ordinary shares which bears the same ratio to the total number of ordinary shares held by the tag along shareholder, on an outstanding basis, as the ratio that the number of the offered shares bears to the selling party's total number of ordinary shares of the company, on an outstanding basis, and upon the same terms and conditions under which the selling party's ordinary shares shall be sold. in the event that the tag along shareholder exercises its rights hereunder, the selling party must cause the proposed purchaser to add such ordinary shares to the offered shares to be purchased by the proposed purchaser, as part of the sale agreement, or reduce the number of ordinary shares that it proposes to sell to the proposed purchaser (in which case, the selling party and the tag along shareholder will contribute the identical portion of ordinary shares relative to their total shareholdings in the company, calculated on an outstanding basis), and either conclude the transaction in accordance with such revised structure or withdraw from completing the transaction. notwithstanding the above said, this section 2.9 shall not apply to sales by ms of its shares of the company. 2.10. notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this section 2 shall not apply to any transfer of ordinary shares by a shareholder to its permitted transferees. for purposes of this agreement, the term "permitted transferees" shall mean an entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with the selling party. a transferee by operation of law shall not be considered permitted transferee. notwithstanding anything set forth above, in the event that a banking institution realizes its pledge over shares of the company held by a shareholder and wishes to sell any or all of such shares, the other shareholder whose shares of the company are not being sold by such banking institution shall be granted a right of first offer with respect to such shares (in accordance with the provisions of section 2.8 above) but shall not have the tag-along right set forth in section 2.9 above. 2.11. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 2, the parties acknowledge that elbit is under contractual obligation dated july 4, 1993 to joseph barath and hillel avni (the "other parties"), who are entitled to a right of first refusal with respect to any transfer of ordinary shares of the company by elbit. accordingly any offer made by elbit to the offerees, shall be made at the same time by elbit to the other parties. in the event the other parties exercise such right, elbit's offer to the offerees shall be deemed to be void. however, elbit shall notify the offerees of the waiver of the right by the other parties or the expiration of the notice period for such other parties to fully exercise such right and failure by both to fully exercise such right (the "elbit notice"), in either case within 2 business days of receipt of such waiver or expiration of such notice period. within 5 business days of receipt of the elbit notice each offeree shall be entitled to exercise his option to purchased the offered shares either according to his pro rata fraction of the offered shares or any remaining offered shares and the provisions of section 2.8 shall apply. 2.12. notwithstanding the above, any sale/s of shares of the company in the market in accordance with rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, shall not be subject to any of the restrictions on transfer set forth in this section 2. 3. term of the agreement --------------------- 3.1. this agreement shall be signed at the closing and shall enter into force upon written notice by mivtach to the other shareholders. notwithstanding the above said, this agreement shall be null and void and have no effect in the event that mivtach shall not have delivered such notice prior to the expiration of the conversion period as defined in the cn &w. 3.2. a shareholder whose holdings of ordinary shares of the company (which holdings, in the case of ms, shall including any
