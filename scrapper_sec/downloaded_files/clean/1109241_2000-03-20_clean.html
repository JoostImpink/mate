(b) automatic conversion. each share of series a preferred stock shall -------------------- automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion price as provided in section 5(a) above, after adjustment as provided elsewhere in this section 5, (i) immediately prior to the closing of an underwritten public offering of the corporation's common stock (a) immediately following which offering the corporation's common stock trades on the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq national market or any national securities exchange with recognition by regulatory authorities not materially different from, and listing standards not less stringent than those imposed by, the nasdaq national market and (b) at a price per share of common stock (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations of or on the common stock) not less than five dollars ($5.00) for each share of common stock into which the series a preferred stock would then convert, and which results in gross proceeds to the corporation of at least ten million dollars ($10,000,000); or (ii) at the election of the holders of at least a majority of the series a preferred stock, voting as a separate class, to automatically convert all of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. (c) mechanics of conversion. before any holder of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of common stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for such stock, and shall give written notice to the corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which it wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. the corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which it shall be entitled as aforesaid. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the shares of series a preferred stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock on such date. -4- (d) conversion price adjustments of preferred stock for certain dilutive issuances, splits and combinations. (i) the conversion price of series a preferred stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) upon each issuance by this corporation of any additional stock (as defined below) after the date the first share of series a preferred stock was originally issued, without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the conversion price for such series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such additional stock, the conversion price for such series in effect immediately prior to each issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock that the aggregate consideration received by the corporation for such issuance would purchase at such conversion price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such additional stock. (b) no adjustment of the conversion price for series a preferred stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent ($.01) per share, provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three (3) years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, and upon such adjustment the conversion price for such preferred stock shall be rounded up or down to the nearest cent. except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 5(d)(i) (e)(3), or (e)(4) or 5(d)(iv), no adjustment of such conversion price pursuant to this subsection 5(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the conversion price above the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. (c) in the case of the issuance of common stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by this corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. (d) in the case of the issuance of the common stock for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors irrespective of any accounting treatment. (e) in the case of the issuance of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock, securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection 5(d)(i) and subsection 5(d)(ii): (1) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise (whether or not then exercisable) of such options to -5- purchase or rights to subscribe for common stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the sum of the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections 5(d)(i)(c) and (d)(i)(d)), if any, received by the corporation upon the issuance of such options or rights, and the exercise price provided for in such options or rights for the common stock covered thereby. (2) the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (whether or not then convertible or exchangeable) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the sum of the consideration, if any, received by the corporation for any such securities and related options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), and the additional consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities (other than the principal amount of convertible securities to the extent the corporation has received such consideration as of the issuance thereof) or the exercise of any related options or rights. (3) in the event of any change in the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such convertible or exchangeable securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the conversion price of the series a preferred stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change. (4) upon the expiration of any such options or rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options or rights related to such convertible or exchangeable securities, the conversion price of the series a preferred stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number of shares of common stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such securities. (ii) "additional stock" shall mean any shares of common stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 5(d)(i)(e)) by this corporation after the date the first share of series a preferred stock was originally issued other than: (a) common stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in subsection 5(d)(iii) hereof; (b) common stock issuable or issued to employees or service providers of this corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock plan at the then current fair market value, as approved and determined by the board of directors of this corporation; or -6- (c) common stock issued upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock. (iii) in the event the corporation should at any time or from time to time after the date the first share of series a preferred stock was originally issued fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock or the determination of holders of common stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of common stock (hereinafter referred to as "common stock equivalents") without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of common stock or the common stock equivalents (including the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the conversion price of the series a preferred stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of common stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such common stock equivalents. (iv) if the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time after the date the first share of series a preferred stock was originally issued is decreased by a reverse-split or combination of the outstanding shares of common stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the conversion price for the series a preferred stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares. (e) other distributions. in the event this corporation shall declare a ------------------- distribution payable in securities of other entities, evidences of indebtedness issued by this corporation or other entities, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 5(d)(iii), then, in each such case for other purposes of this subsection 5(e), the holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of common stock of the corporation into which their shares of series a preferred stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of common stock of the corporation entitled to receive such distribution. (f) recapitalizations. if at any time or from time to time there shall be ----------------- a recapitalization of the common stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this section 5 or section 2), provision shall be made so that the holders of series a preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such preferred stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of such number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion immediately prior to that recapitalization would have been entitled on such recapitalization. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of series a preferred stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this section 5 (including adjustment of the conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of series a preferred stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. -7- (g) capital reorganization, merger or sale of assets. if at any time or ------------------------------------------------ from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the common stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this section 5) or a merger or consolidation of the corporation with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of the series a preferred stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the series a preferred stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation or sale, to which a holder of common stock issuable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale or an amount of cash receivable as if the series a preferred stock had converted into shares of common stock. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock after the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this section 5 shall be applicable after that event in as nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable. each holder of series a preferred stock upon the occurrence of an event set forth in this section 5(g), shall, subject to automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 5(b), have the option of electing treatment of his shares of series a preferred stock under either this section 5(g) or section 2 hereof, if applicable, by giving the corporation written notice of such election at least ten days prior to the close of such transaction unless such holders received notice of the transaction less than 20 days prior to the close of such transaction, then the notice of election shall be given within 10 days after such notice. (h) certificates as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each ------------------------------ adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this section 5, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and cause independent public accountants selected by the corporation to verify such computation and prepare and furnish to each holder of series a preferred stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of series a preferred stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the conversion price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of series a preferred stock. (i) issue taxes. the corporation shall pay any and all issue and other ----------- taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of shares of series a preferred stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder in connection with any such conversion. (j) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the corporation shall --------------------------------------------- at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series a preferred stock, such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of -8- all then outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to its certificate of incorporation. for the purpose of increasing the number of shares of common stock authorized to provide enough common stock to fully convert the series a preferred stock, the series a preferred stock shall vote in favor of such amendment to the certificate of incorporation. (k) no fractional shares. no fractional share shall be issued upon the -------------------- conversion of any share or shares of series a preferred stock. all shares of common stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of series a preferred stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. if, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of common stock, the corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the corporation). 6. amendment. any term relating to the series a preferred stock may be amended and the observance of any term relating to the series a preferred stock may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance) only with the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock. any amendment so effected shall be binding upon the corporation and any holder of the series a preferred stock. 7. protective provisions.

or (h) if the company shall fail to comply with (i) any agreement pursuant to which the company shall be liable for an amount in excess of $50,000 upon any default thereof, or (ii) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement binding on it or affecting its properties, and in any such case such failure continues after the applicable grace or notice period, if any, specified in such agreement on the date of such failure; or (i) if any judgment, writ, warrant or attachment or execution or similar process which calls for payment or presents liability in excess of $50,000 shall be rendered, issued or levied against the company or its property and such process shall not be waived, stayed, vacated or fully bonded within thirty (30) days after its issuance or levy, unless such judgment is covered by insurance and the insurer has acknowledged coverage in writing with respect thereto; then, and in each and every such case, holder may by notice in writing to the company declare all amounts under this note to be forthwith due and payable (except that, in the case of an event of default under either section 3(c) or section 3(d), this note shall become immediately due and payable without notice) and thereupon the balance shall become so due and payable, without presentation, protest or further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived. 4. conversion. subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of ---------- this section 4, at the option of holder, at any time or from time to time, this note may be converted, in whole or in part, into shares of series a preferred stock of the company by the surrender of this note in the manner specified in section 4(a) below. the number of shares of series a preferred stock into which this note shall be convertible shall equal the principal amount of the note being converted divided by the "conversion price" (as hereinafter defined). the conversion price shall initially be $4.5045 per share, and shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to section 4(b) below. (a) mechanics of conversion. before holder shall be entitled to ----------------------- convert this note, holder shall surrender this note, duly endorsed, at the company's principal 4 corporate office, together with written notice of holder's election to convert the same, and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of series a preferred stock are to be issued. the company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to holder, or to the nominee or nominees of holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of series a preferred stock to which holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the note to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of series a preferred stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of series a preferred stock as of such date. if this note is converted in part, this note must be converted for a number of whole shares of series a preferred stock and holder shall be entitled to receive a new note covering the remaining principal amount in respect of which this note has not been converted. upon such surrender of this note, the company will issue a certificate or certificates in the name of holder for the largest number of whole shares of series a preferred stock to which holder shall be entitled and, if this note is converted in whole, in lieu of any fractional share of series a preferred stock to which holder shall be entitled, cash equal to the remaining amount due hereunder. if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the securities act of 1933, the conversion may, at the option of holder, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of series a preferred stock or common stock, as applicable, issuable upon conversion of this note shall not be deemed to have converted this note until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities. (b) conversion price adjustments for certain dilutive issuances, ------------------------------------------------------------ splits and combinations. the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment - ----------------------- from time to time as follows: (i) in the event the company should at any time or from time to time after the date of execution of this convertible promissory note and loan agreement (the "effective date") fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock or the determination of holders of series a preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock, common stock or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of series a preferred stock or common stock (hereinafter referred to as "common stock equivalents") without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of series a preferred stock, common stock or the common stock equivalents (including the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the conversion price shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of series a preferred stock issuable on conversion of this note shall be increased in proportion to such increase of the aggregate of shares of series a preferred stock and common stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such common stock equivalents. (ii) if the number of shares of series a preferred stock outstanding at any time after the effective date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock, then, following the record date of such 5 combination, the conversion price shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of series a preferred stock issuable on conversion of this note shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. (c) other distributions. in the event the company shall declare a ------------------- distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in section 4(b)(i), then, in each such case for other purposes of this section 4(c), holder shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holder of the number of shares of series a preferred stock of the company into which this note is convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of series a preferred stock of the company entitled to receive such distribution in respect of shares of series a preferred stock. (d) recapitalizations. if at any time or from time to time there ----------------- shall be a recapitalization of the series a preferred stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction or like transaction provided for elsewhere in this section 4), provision shall be made so that holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the note the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company, or otherwise, to which a holder of series a preferred stock would have been entitled on such recapitalization. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 4 with respect to the rights of holder after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this section 4 (including adjustment of the conversion price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the notes) shall be applicable after that event as they were before as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. (e) no impairment. the company will not, by amendment of its ------------- certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of holder against impairment. (f) certificate as to adjustment. upon the occurrence of each ---------------------------- adjustment or readjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this section 4, the company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and cause its chief financial officer to verify such computation and prepare and furnish to holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the company shall, upon the written request at any time of holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to holder a like certificate setting forth (a) such adjustment and readjustment, (b) the conversion price at the time in effect, and (c) the number of shares of series a preferred stock and the amount, if any, of other securities and/or property which at the time would be receivable upon the conversion of the note. such certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts as may be necessary to show the reason for and manner of computing such adjustment. if demanded by holder, the company shall provide holder a verification or confirmation of 6 the calculation of such adjustment signed by an independent certified public accountant, which may be the firm of independent certified public accountants servicing the company. (g) notices of record date. in the event of any taking by the ---------------------- company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining if holder is entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the company shall mail to holder, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right. (h) taxes on conversion. the issue of share certificates on ------------------- conversion of this note shall be made without charge to holder for any tax in respect of the issue thereof. the company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares in any name other than that of holder, and the company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate in respect of such shares unless and until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the company that such tax has been paid. (i) reservation of conversion securities. the company agrees that it ------------------------------------ will use its best efforts to have its stockholders authorize, and once so authorized it will at all times have authorized and reserved, and will keep available, solely for issuance or delivery upon the conversion of this note, the shares of series a preferred stock and other securities and properties as from time to time shall be receivable upon the conversion of this note, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock. (j) no rights as stockholders. prior to the conversion of this note, ------------------------- holder shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the company, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any pre-emptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the company, except as provided herein or in the purchase agreement or as otherwise agreed. 5. merger, consolidation. --------------------- (a) acceleration on merger, consolidation. in the event of (i) any ------------------------------------- consolidation or merger of the company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization in which the company shall not be the continuing or surviving entity, or any transaction or series of related transactions by the company in which in excess of 50% of the company's voting power is issued for the purpose of combining with or acquisition by one or more corporations or other entities or persons; or (ii) a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, then, at the election of holder made by written notice given to the company, the principal and accrued interest on this note shall be due and payable at the closing of any such transaction. (b) notices. the company shall give holder written notice of such ------- impending transaction not later than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholders' meeting 7 called to approve such transaction, or twenty (20) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier. the first of such notices shall describe the material terms and conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this section 5 and the company shall thereafter give holder prompt notice of any material changes. the transaction shall in no event take place sooner than twenty (20) days after the company has given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the company has given the notice provided for herein of any material changes. 6. transfer. subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in -------- the purchase agreement, upon surrender of this note for transfer or exchange, a new note or new notes of the same tenor, dated the date to which interest has been paid on the surrendered note and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the note so surrendered, will be issued to and registered in the name of the transferee or transferees. the company may treat the person in whose name this note is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. 7. prepayment of

(f) immediately notify holder, at any time when a disclosure document relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event which comes to the company's attention if as a result of such event the disclosure document included in such registration statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and promptly prepare and furnish to holder a supplement or amendment to such disclosure document so that, as thereafter delivered to holder, such disclosure document will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. (g) use its best efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on a national securities exchange (including nasdaq national market) or, if not available, or such other securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company may then be listed, and enter into such customary agreements including a listing application and indemnification agreement in customary form, and to provide a transfer agent and registrar for such registrable securities covered by such registration statement no later than the effective date of such registration statement.

(k) furnish, at the request of holder, on the date that registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, or on the effective date of the registration statement, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the company, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to holder, and (ii) to the extent permitted under the rules of the aicpa, a letter, dated such date, from the independent accountants of the company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to holder. (l) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission, and make available to holder, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months, beginning with the first month after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section

or amended disclosure document contemplated by section 1.6(f). 1.7 indemnification. --------------- (a) indemnification by the company. in the event of any registration of any securities of the company under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, the company will indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, holder, its respective directors and officers, general partners, limited partners and managing directors, each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with holder or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act (and directors, officers, controlling persons, partners and managing directors of any of the foregoing), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, and expenses (including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the 7 company's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) to which holder, any such director or officer or general or limited partner or managing director or any such underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act, state securities or "blue sky" laws, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained, on the effective date thereof, in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary, final or summary disclosure document contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of any federal, state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the company and relating to any action or inaction by the company in connection with any such registration. the company shall reimburse holder and each such director, officer, general partner, limited partner, managing director or underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding. the company shall not be liable under this section 1.7 in any case to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto or in any such preliminary, final or summary disclosure document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by holder in its capacity as a holder of registrable securities in the company or any such director, officer, general or limited partner, managing director or underwriter specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and that the company shall not be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of registrable securities, if any, or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, pursuant to this section with respect to any preliminary disclosure document or the final disclosure document or the final disclosure document as amended or supplemented as the case may be, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such underwriter or controlling person results from the fact that such underwriter sold registrable securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the final disclosure document or of the final disclosure document as then amended or supplemented, whichever is most recent, if the company has previously furnished copies thereof to such underwriter and such final disclosure document, as then amended or supplemented, had corrected any such misstatement or omission. the indemnity provided for herein shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of holder or any such director, officer, general partner, limited partner, managing director, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder. (b) indemnification by holder. the company may require, as a condition to ------------------------- including any registrable securities in any registration statement filed in accordance with the provisions hereof, that the company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from holder, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) above) the company and its directors, officers, controlling persons and all other prospective sellers and their respective directors, officers, general and limited partners, managing directors, and their respective controlling persons with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary disclosure document contained therein, or any amendment or supplement, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company or its 8 representatives through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary disclosure document or amendment or supplement, or a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or holder, underwriters or any of their respective directors, officers, general or limited partners, managing directors or controlling persons and shall survive the transfer of such securities by holder, provided, however, that holder shall not be liable in the -------- ------- aggregate for any amounts exceeding the product derived from multiplying the sale price per registrable security times the number of registrable securities sold pursuant to such registration statement or disclosure document by such holder. (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party ---------------------- hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this section 1.7, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, promptly give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the -------- indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subsections of this section, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defense thereof, and the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel in any single jurisdiction for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels as may be reasonably necessary. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the rights set forth above, in any event each party will have the right to retain, at its own expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim. (d) other indemnification. indemnification similar to that specified in --------------------- the preceding subsections of this section 1.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and holder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the securities act. 9 (e) contribution. in order to provide for just and equitable contribution ------------ in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this section is for any reason held to be unenforceable although applicable in accordance with its terms, the company, holder and the underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement incurred by the company, holder and the underwriters, in such proportions that the underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing in the disclosure document bears to the offering price appearing therein and the company and holder are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no -------- ------- person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. as between the company and holder, such parties shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect (x) the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and holder, on the other hand, from the offering of the registrable securities and any other securities included in such offering, and (y) the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and holder, on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and holder, on the other hand, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the sum of the total purchase price paid to the company in respect of the registrable securities plus the total net proceeds received by the company from the offering of any securities included in such offering (before deducting expenses) bears to the amount by which the total net proceeds from the offering of registrable securities (before deducting expenses) received by holder with respect to such offering exceeds the purchase price paid by holder to the company in respect of the registrable securities, and in each case the net proceeds received from such offering shall be determined as set forth in the disclosure document. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or holder, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. the company and holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the company and holder agree that any contribution required to be made by holder pursuant to this section 1.7(e) shall not exceed the net proceeds from the offering of registrable securities (before deducting expenses) received by holder with respect to such offering. for purposes of this section, each person, if any, who controls a holder of registrable securities or an underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act shall have the same rights to contribution as holder or underwriter, and each director of the company, each officer of the company who signed the registration statement, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act shall have the same rights to contribution as the company. 1.8 rule 144. at all times hereafter, the company agrees that it will file -------- in a timely manner all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the exchange act, and, if at any time the company is not required to file such reports, it will make available to the public, to the extent required to permit the sale of shares by any holder of registrable securities pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, current information about itself and its activities as contemplated by rule 144. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company 10 may deregister any class of its equity securities under section 12 of the exchange act or suspend its duty to file reports with respect to any class of its securities pursuant to section 15(d) of the exchange act if it is then permitted to do so pursuant to the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 2. right of first refusal 2.1 right of first refusal. if at any time the company or any subsidiary ---------------------- desires to issue, sell or exchange, agree or obligate itself to issue, sell or exchange, or reserve or set aside for issuance, sale or exchange, any debt securities, shares of preferred stock or shares of common stock or any common stock equivalents or capital stock of any subsidiary in a privately-negotiated transaction pursuant to a bona fide offer from a third party or through its agent (the "proposed buyer"), the company shall first submit a written offer (the "offer") to sell such securities (the "offered securities") to holder on terms and conditions, including price, not less favorable to holder than those on which the company proposes to sell such offered securities to the proposed buyer. holder shall have the absolute right to purchase that number of the offered securities (its "pro rata fraction") as shall be equal to the number of offered securities multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of fully diluted outstanding common stock then owned by holder and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of shares of fully diluted outstanding common stock. 2.2 the offer. the offer shall disclose the identity of the proposed --------- buyer, the number and class of offered securities proposed to be sold, the terms and conditions, including price, of the proposed sale, and any other material facts relating to the proposed sale. the offer shall further state that holder may acquire, in accordance with the provisions of this section 2, its pro rata fraction of the offered securities for the price indicated in the offer and upon the other terms and conditions, including deferred or installment payment (if applicable), set forth therein. 2.3 notice of acceptance. if holder desires to purchase its pro rata -------------------- fraction of the offered securities, holder shall deliver a written notice of its election to purchase such shares to the company, which notice shall state the number of offered securities holder desires to purchase and shall be delivered in person or mailed to the company within 30 days of the date of receipt by holder of the offer. such notice shall, when taken in conjunction with the offer, be deemed to constitute a valid, legally binding and enforceable agreement for the sale to and purchase by holder of that number of offered securities as determined by its pro rata fraction, on the terms of the offer. 2.4 closing. the closing of the sale of offered securities to holder ------- pursuant to this section 2 shall be made at the offices of the company on such date as may be agreed by holder and the company, but no later than the 60th day following the date the offer is received by holder. such sale shall be effected by the company's delivery to holder of a certificate(s) issued in the name of holder evidencing the offered securities to be purchased by holder, duly endorsed for transfer, against payment to the company of the purchase price by holder. the exercise or nonexercise by holder of its first refusal rights pursuant to this section 2 shall be without prejudice to its first refusal rights under this section 2 with respect to any future sale of securities. 2.5 sales to proposed transferee. the offered securities not so purchased ---------------------------- may be sold at any time within 120 days after the date the offer was made. any such sale shall be to the proposed buyer, at not less than the price and upon other terms and conditions, if any, not more favorable to the transferee than those specified in the offer. any offered securities not sold within 11 the permitted time period shall continue to be subject to the requirements of a prior offer pursuant to this section 2. 2.6 exception. the first refusal rights of holder under this section 2 shall not apply to the issuance of the following securities ("excluded securities"): (a) shares of common stock, or options exercisable therefor, granted to directors, officers or employees of or consultants to the company or any subsidiary pursuant to any qualified or non-qualified stock option plan or agreement, employee stock ownership plan, stock purchase agreement, stock plan, stock restriction agreement, or consulting agreement or such other options, arrangements, agreements or plans approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company; (b) securities issued solely in consideration for the acquisition (whether by merger or otherwise) by the company of all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of any other

consultants, directors, attorneys or independent accountants. 3.2 budget approval. at least 30 days prior to the commencement of each --------------- fiscal year, the company shall prepare and submit to, and obtain in respect thereof the approval of the majority of the members of, the board of directors of the company (the "board"), a business plan and monthly operating budget in detail for each
