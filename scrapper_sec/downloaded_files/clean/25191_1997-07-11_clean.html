transferring employees. ccr acknowledges that if assets are transferred (representing the cost of the accrued benefits) from ccr's deferred compensation plan and supplemental executive retirement plan to such plans of cwm reit, they shall be considered to have been attributable to amounts paid by cwm reit pursuant to the provisions of the management agreement. all reasonable expenses of any

not fewer than 60 months from the effective time policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance currently in force for its own officers and directors to cover those persons who are or were

less advantageous than those contained in the policies currently in force) with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, unless it can be shown that such policies cannot be obtained or maintained, as the case may be, by ccr on terms that are commercially reasonable at such time; provided, that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such 60 months, such coverage in respect thereof shall not be terminated until final disposition of all such claims. cwm reit shall reimburse ccr for the cost of obtaining or maintaining, as the case may be, such policies

"commission" means the securities and exchange commission. "exchange act" means the securities exchange act of 1934, and the rules and regulations of the commission promulgated thereunder. "registrable security" means each of the shares of common stock acquired by ccr pursuant to the merger agreement upon original issue thereof and at all times subsequent thereto (including through the exercise of the special purchase rights granted pursuant to section 2.4 of this agreement), until (i) it has been disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement under the act covering it, (ii) it is distributed to the public pursuant to rule 144 under the act, as such rule may be amended from time to time (or any similar provision then in effect) ("rule 144"), or (iii) it is sold, assigned or otherwise transferred in any other transaction not requiring registration under the act. "special purchase rights" as defined in section 2.4. "triggering date" means the second anniversary of the effective time. section 2.1 demand registration (a) request for registration. at any time and from time to time on and after the triggering date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, ccr may make a written request to cwm reit to file with the commission a registration statement ("demand registration statement") and such other documents, including a prospectus, as may be necessary in order to comply with the provisions of the act so as to permit a public offering and sale of up to all of the registrable securities (subject to the limitations set forth in section 8.20 of the merger agreement). any registration effected under this paragraph (a) is hereinafter referred to as a "demand registration." ccr may make, in the aggregate, not more than two (2) requests for a demand registration. ccr shall have the right to withdraw any such request by giving written notice to cwm reit of its request to withdraw at any time prior to effectiveness of the registration statement therefor; provided that in the event of such withdrawal, ccr shall be responsible for all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by cwm reit prior to such withdrawal and provided further that such requested registration shall not count toward the two demand registration requests permitted pursuant to this section 2.1(a). any request to effect a demand registration shall specify the number of shares of registrable securities proposed to be sold and shall also specify the intended method of disposition thereof. there shall be permitted hereunder only one demand registration during any nine (9) month period, measured in each case from the effective date of the most recent demand registration. the minimum aggregate number of registrable securities that must be covered by any demand registration statement request shall be the lesser of (i) 1,250,000 shares of common stock and (ii) registrable securities having a market value of $20,000,000. (b) effective registration. a registration will not be deemed to have been effected as a demand registration unless and until it has been declared effective by the commission and cwm reit has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this registration rights agreement with respect thereto; provided that if, after it has become effective, the offering of securities pursuant to such registration is or becomes the subject of any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or any other governmental or administrative agency, or if any court prevents or otherwise limits the sale of such securities pursuant to the registration, such registration will be deemed not to have been effected as to the shares subject to such stop order, injunction, other order, requirement or limitation unless such stop order, injunction, other order, requirement or limitation is rescinded or the issuance of such stop order, injunction, other order, requirement or limitation is imposed in response to an act or omission on the part of ccr. if a registration requested pursuant to this section 2.1 is deemed not to have been effected and such failure to have been effected is not the result of any act or omission of ccr (other than a withdrawal of such request by ccr prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement therefor), then cwm reit shall continue to be obligated to effect such registration pursuant to this section 2.1 (and such registration shall not count toward the two demand registration requests permitted pursuant to section 2.1(a)). (c) selection of underwriters. if ccr so elects, the offering of registrable securities pursuant to a demand registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering, in which case cwm reit and ccr shall jointly select one or more nationally recognized firms of investment bankers to act as the managing underwriters (the "underwriters") in connection with such offering. (d) deferral. notwithstanding the foregoing, if cwm reit shall furnish to ccr a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of cwm reit stating that the board of directors of cwm reit has, by duly authorized resolution, determined in good faith that, in light of the pendency of a material transaction (as defined below), it would be materially detrimental to cwm reit and its shareholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore in the best interest of cwm reit to defer the filing of such registration statement, cwm reit shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request for a demand registration. ccr acknowledges that it would be materially detrimental to cwm reit and its shareholders for such registration statement to be filed and therefore in the best interest of cwm reit to defer such filing if such filing would impose an undue burden upon the ability of cwm reit to proceed with any reorganization, merger, consolidation or acquisition of the securities or assets of another firm or corporation or disposition of the securities or assets of cwm reit or a public offering by cwm reit of common stock or other securities of cwm reit registered under the act which, in each case, is material to cwm reit (a "material transaction"). if cwm reit shall have delivered the certificate referred to above and thereafter (if applicable) shall have entered into a definitive agreement or filed a registration statement or a proxy statement in connection with a material transaction, cwm reit shall, upon written notice to ccr, have the right to defer the filing of the registration statement requested to be filed by ccr but in no event for longer than sixty (60) days from the expiration of the initial ninety (90) day extension period referred to above as is reasonably necessary to enable cwm reit to satisfy its disclosure obligations under the act in such registration statement with respect to the material transaction. (e) reduction of offering. cwm reit may include in a demand registration pursuant to this section 2.1 shares of common stock for the account of cwm reit and for the account of any other person or entity who holds shares of common stock; provided, however, that if the lead managing underwriter of any underwritten offering described in this section 2.1 shall have informed cwm reit in writing that in its opinion the total number of shares of common stock that ccr, cwm reit and any other persons or entities desiring to participate in such registration intend to include in such offering is such as to materially and adversely affect the success of such offering, then cwm reit shall include in such demand registration all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by ccr up to such number of shares of common stock that the lead managing underwriter has informed cwm reit may be included in such registration without adversely affecting the success of such offering; provided that, if the number of such registrable securities requested to be included by ccr is less than the number of shares that the lead managing underwriter has informed cwm reit may be included in such registration without adversely affecting the success of such offering, then cwm reit shall include in such demand registration the shares of common stock that cwm reit and any other persons or entities desiring to participate in such registration desire to include in such registration; provided further that the number of shares of common stock to be offered for the account of cwm reit and all such other persons and entities participating in such registration shall be reduced or limited pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be registered by such persons and entities to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such lead managing underwriter. (f) filings. whenever cwm reit is required to effect or cause the registration of registrable securities pursuant to this section 2.1, cwm reit will use its reasonable efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof as promptly as practicable, and in connection with any such request cwm reit will as expeditiously as possible (and in no event more than forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of written request from ccr pursuant to section 2.1(a) to register registrable securities) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement as described in section 4.1 hereof. (g) registration rights of other parties. cwm reit will not grant registration rights superior to or inconsistent with the registration rights granted to ccr under this registration rights agreement. section 2.2 incidental offerings if cwm reit at any time proposes to file a registration statement covering any of its common stock under the act (other than any registration by cwm reit (a) on form s-8 or a successor or substantially similar form of an employee share option, share purchase or compensation plan or of common stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such plan, (b) of a dividend reinvestment plan or (c) on form s-4 or a successor or substantially similar form of shares issuable in connection with any acquisition, merger, exchange or similar transaction), cwm reit will give prompt notice to ccr of its intention to do so. upon the written request of ccr made within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of registrable securities intended to be disposed of by ccr), cwm reit will use its best efforts to arrange to include all the registrable securities as to which it has received such requests, provided that if the registration statement relates to an underwritten offering of common stock and if the lead managing underwriter of such underwritten offering shall by letter inform cwm reit that in its opinion the inclusion in such underwritten distribution of all or a specified number of such registrable securities or of any other shares of common stock requested to be included would interfere with the successful marketing of the common stock in such distribution by the underwriters, then cwm reit may, upon written notice to ccr, exclude from such underwritten offering (i) in the event the registration statement relates to an offering for the account of cwm reit, shares of common stock requested to be included by any persons or entities other than cwm reit, pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be included by such persons and entities, to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such underwriter and (ii) in the event the registration statements relates to an offering for the account of any person or entity other than cwm reit, (a) first, shares of common stock requested to be registered by cwm reit, (b) second, to the extent reduction as a result of clause (a) is insufficient, shares of common stock requested to be registered for the account of any persons or entities other than the person or entity making the initial request for such registration (the "requesting party"), pro rata in proportion to the respective number of shares of common stock requested to be registered by such other persons and entities to the extent necessary to reduce the respective total number of shares of common stock requested to be included in such offering to the number of shares of common stock recommended by such underwriter and (c) third, to the extent reduction as a result of clauses (a) and (b) is insufficient, shares of common stock requested to be registered for the account of the requesting party. the company may decline to file a registration statement referred to in this section 2.2 after giving notice to ccr, or withdraw such a registration statement after filing, or otherwise abandon any such proposed underwritten offering, provided that the company shall promptly notify ccr in writing of any such action. section 2.3 ccr's rights and obligations ccr may not participate in any underwritten offering under section 2.1 or section 2.2 hereof unless it completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, underwriting agreements, and other customary documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. in connection with any underwritten offering under section 2.1 or 2.2, each of ccr and cwm reit shall be a party to the underwriting agreement with the underwriters and may be required to make certain customary representations and warranties (in the case of ccr as to the registrable securities being sold by ccr in such underwritten offering) and provide certain customary indemnifications for the benefit of the underwriters. section 2.4 special purchase rights (a) prior to the offering of any voting capital stock of cwm reit (or security convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for voting capital stock), other than shares of common stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for common stock) issued (i) pursuant to any employee stock option plan or employee stock purchase plan, (ii) as consideration in making acquisitions or (iii) pursuant to the existing cwm reit dividend reinvestment plan or any successor thereto (the "drip"), (an "offering") ccr may offer and shall have the right (the "right of first offer") to purchase from cwm reit such number of shares of such capital stock or securities as may be required to maintain its proportional voting interest (based on the total voting interest of the company's capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such offering). cwm reit shall provide ccr notice of any offering within 30 days prior to the commencement thereof, and within 10 business days following receipt of such notice, ccr shall advise cwm reit in writing that it intends to purchase all or a portion of its proportional percentage of the shares proposed to be issued in the offering. any purchase by ccr pursuant hereto shall be made on the terms and be subject to the conditions applicable to other purchasers in the offering. subject to section 2.4(e), this right of first offer shall expire on the earlier of (i) the 20th anniversary of the effective time, (ii) the date on which ccr ceases to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (excluding from the number of shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of such calculation all outstanding shares of common stock issued after the effective time pursuant to any employee stock option, employee stock purchase or compensation plan and all shares of common stock issued after the effective time as consideration in making acquisitions), (iii) the date on which ccr ceases to beneficially own 2% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, and (iv) the date of a change of control. (b) ccr shall be entitled to participate (the "right to participate" and together with the right of first offer, the "special purchase rights") in the drip on the same terms and subject to the same conditions and procedures applicable to other participants, subject to and in accordance with the following additional provisions: (i) with respect to common stock to be issued pursuant to the optional cash payment feature of the drip, cwm reit shall notify ccr, at least four (4) business days prior to the applicable "threshold price and waiver discount set date" (as defined in the existing drip), of (x) the dollar amount of shares of common stock (expressed as an aggregate cash price) which cwm reit desires to accept from its shareholders on the next occurring "investment date" (as defined in the drip or the comparable date under any successor plan) (such aggregate desired dollar amount being referred to herein as the "maximum investment amount") and (y) the aggregate number of shares of common stock of cwm reit outstanding as of the last day of the immediately preceding month. for any investment date under the optional cash payment feature of the drip, the maximum dollar amount permitted to be invested by ccr pursuant to the right to participate shall be calculated as (x) ccr's "participation percentage" (as defined below), multiplied by (y) the maximum investment amount (such product being referred to herein as the "maximum ccr investment"). no later than two (2) business days following receipt of such notice from cwm reit, ccr shall specify in writing to cwm reit (1) the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by ccr on such date, and (2) whether, with respect to the common stock to be issued on the next occurring investment date, ccr wishes to make any optional cash payment and the actual dollar amount thereof, which may be any dollar amount up to and including the maximum ccr investment for such month (such actual dollar amount being referred to herein as the "requested ccr investment"). any election by ccr to participate in the optional cash payment feature of the drip hereunder (and the related election of the requested ccr investment) shall be irrevocable for the applicable investment date, and any failure by ccr to make such election shall be deemed to be an election not to participate for the applicable investment date. in the event cwm reit elects to increase the maximum investment amount for the applicable investment date, ccr shall be provided with notice of such increase and an opportunity to increase the requested ccr investment on a pro rata basis. in the event cwm reit elects to reduce the maximum investment amount for the applicable investment date, and/or the maximum investment amount is subject to reduction under the terms of the drip (such reduced amount, in either case, being referred to herein as the "actual investment amount"), cwm reit shall so notify ccr, and the requested ccr investment shall in such event be reduced on a pro rata basis. in administering the optional cash investment feature of the drip, cwm reit shall include the requested ccr investment as a portion of the maximum investment amount proposed to be raised, and in the event that for any investment date, the maximum investment amount is reduced to the actual investment amount, the requested ccr investment (as reduced pro rata) shall be included as a portion of said actual investment amount. subject to the limitations and adjustments applicable to the requested ccr investment provided herein, ccr shall be entitled to make such requested ccr investment. for purposes of this section 2.4(b), ccr's participation percentage shall be defined as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) calculated as (x) the outstanding shares of the common stock beneficially owned by ccr at any date of determination, divided by (y) the aggregate shares of common stock of cwm reit outstanding at such date of determination. (ii) with respect to the dividend reinvestment feature of the drip, cwm reit shall notify ccr, within ten (10) days after the "record date" (as defined in the drip) for the payment of the applicable dividend for the applicable fiscal quarter of cwm reit, of the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock (expressed as a decimal and without giving effect to any shares of common stock beneficially owned by ccr) which have theretofore validly elected to participate in the drip with respect to the next occurring dividend payment (the "maximum reinvestment percentage"). no later than two (2) business days following receipt of such notice from cwm reit, ccr shall pursuant to the right to participate specify in writing to cwm reit whether (x) ccr wishes to elect for its outstanding beneficially owned shares of common stock to participate in the dividend reinvestment feature of the drip for the next occurring investment date, and (y) the actual percentage (expressed as a decimal) of ccr's outstanding beneficially owned common stock which ccr elects to participate on such investment date, which may be any percentage up to and including the maximum reinvestment percentage for such investment date (such actual percentage being referred to herein as the "ccr reinvestment percentage"). any election by ccr to participate in the dividend reinvestment feature of the drip hereunder (and the related election of the ccr reinvestment percentage) shall be irrevocable for the applicable investment date, and any failure by ccr to make such election shall be deemed to be an election not to participate for the applicable investment date. (iii) the right to participate shall expire on the earlier of (a) the 20th anniversary of the effective time, (b) the date on which ccr ceases to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (excluding from the number of shares of common stock outstanding for purposes of such calculation all outstanding shares of common stock issued after the effective time pursuant to any employee stock option, employee stock purchase or compensation plan and all shares of common stock issued after the effective time as consideration in making acquisitions), (c) the date on which ccr ceases to beneficially own 2% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock and (d) the date of a change of control. (iv) under the right to participate, ccr may elect, in respect of the common stock, to participate in the optional cash payment feature of the drip, and/or to participate in the dividend reinvestment feature of the drip, only to the extent that such optional cash payment and/or such dividend reinvestment, together with all other shares of common stock beneficially owned by ccr, would not cause the percentage of shares of common stock beneficially owned by ccr in the aggregate to exceed the then-current participation percentage. (v) except as otherwise specified in this section 2.4(b) the right to participate may be exercised only in accordance with and subject to the terms of the drip in effect for cwm reit at the time of any such exercise. nothing in this section 2.4 or in this agreement shall be deemed or construed to require cwm reit to create, maintain or renew any drip or similar plan or program; provided, however, that cwm reit may amend or modify the drip so long as such amendments or modifications would not have a material adverse effect on ccr's right to participate in the manner, and subject to the limitations, set forth in section 2.4(b). (c) neither the right of first offer nor the right to participate may be assigned or otherwise transferred, but nothing herein shall preclude any transferee of common stock owned by ccr from participating in the drip. (d) neither the right of first offer nor the right to participate may be exercised in connection with any issuance of common stock pursuant to any employee stock option, employee stock purchase or compensation plan of cwm reit or as consideration in making acquisitions. (e) notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2.4 (i) the special purchase rights shall be subject to, and become effective only upon, the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of common stock cwm reit present and entitled to vote on the matter (the "approval") and (ii) the special purchase rights shall be subject to the subsequent re-approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the common stock present and entitled to vote on the matter upon each of the fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the date immediately succeeding the fifth, tenth or fifteenth anniversary of the date of the approval. in the event that any subsequent re-approval of the holders of common stock shall not be obtained, the special purchase rights shall terminate upon the date immediately succeeding the fifth, tenth or fifteenth anniversary of the approval, as the case may be. in furtherance of the foregoing, in connection with the annual meetings of stockholders of cwm reit corresponding with the fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the date of the approval, subject to the fiduciary duties of cwm reit's board of directors under applicable law as advised by counsel, the board of directors of cwm reit shall recommend and declare advisable the re-approval of the special purchase rights and cwm reit shall take all lawful action to solicit, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain, such re-approvals, including in each case, the inclusion of the recommendation of the cwm reit board of directors in the related proxy statement that the stockholders of cwm reit vote in favor of the re-approval of the special purchase rights. section 3.1 holdback agreement in the case of the registration of any underwritten primary offering of common stock or convertible securities by cwm reit and in which ccr will not be participating in accordance with section 2.2 hereof, ccr agrees, if requested in writing by the lead managing underwriter administering such offering, not to effect any offer, sale or distribution of registrable securities (or any option or right to acquire registrable securities) during the period (not to exceed forty (40) days) commencing on the tenth day prior to the effective date of the registration statement covering such underwritten primary equity offering and ending on the date specified by such managing underwriter or underwriters in such written request to ccr. section 4.1 registration procedures in connection with cwm reit's obligations under this registration rights agreement, cwm reit shall: (a) prepare and file a demand registration statement pursuant to section 2.1 on the appropriate form available for the sale of the registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable efforts to cause such demand registration statement to become effective and remain effective;

(b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to any demand registration statement and any registration statement filed with the commission in connection with an offering in which ccr is or will be offering or selling registrable securities pursuant to section 2.2 (an "incidental registration statement";

(d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 6.1 is unavailable or insufficient to hold an indemnified party for any reason harmless in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of cwm reit on the one hand and of ccr and its officers, directors, agents, trustees and controlling persons on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that ccr shall not be liable for contribution under this section 6.1(d) in an aggregate amount which exceeds the total net proceeds received by ccr from the sale of its registrable securities under the relevant registration statement. cwm reit and ccr agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6.1(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 7.1 rule 144 cwm reit shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the act and the exchange act and shall take such further action as ccr may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable ccr to sell registrable securities without registration under the act within the applicable limitations of rule 144 (or any successor thereto). section 8.1 termination the parties hereto agree that this registration rights agreement shall terminate and the obligations of the parties hereto contained herein shall be released without further action by any party if all of the registrable securities have been (a) disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement or registration statements under the act covering them, (b) distributed to the public pursuant to rule 144 under the act, or (c) sold, assigned or otherwise transferred in any other transaction not requiring registration under the act. section 9.1 miscellaneous (a) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this registration rights agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by written instrument executed by cwm reit and ccr. any party to this registration rights agreement may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, or waive compliance with any of the agreements or obligations of any other party or with any condition, in each case to the extent that such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for its benefit; provided that each such extension or waiver shall be in writing.
