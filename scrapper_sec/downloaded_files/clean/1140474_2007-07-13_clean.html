(d) &#160; cashless exercise . &#160; notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a registration statement (as defined in the registration rights agreement) covering the warrant shares that are the subject of the exercise notice (the " unavailable warrant shares ") is not available for the resale of such unavailable warrant shares at any time during which such registration statement is required in accordance with the registration rights agreement, the holder may, in its sole discretion during such time, exercise this warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the company upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, elect instead to receive upon such exercise the "net number" of shares of common stock determined according to the following formula (a " cashless exercise "): &#160; -3- &#160; net number = (a x b) - (a x c) b&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; for purposes of the foregoing formula: &#160; a= the total number of shares with respect to which this warrant is then being exercised. &#160; b= the closing sale price of the shares of common stock (as reported by bloomberg) on the date immediately preceding the date of the exercise notice. &#160; c= the exercise price then in effect for the applicable warrant shares at the time of such exercise. (e) &#160; disputes . in the case of a dispute as to the determination of the exercise price or the arithmetic calculation of the warrant shares, the company shall promptly issue to the holder the number of warrant shares that are not disputed and resolve such dispute in accordance with section 12. &#160; (f) &#160; limitations on exercises. &#160; (1) &#160; beneficial ownership . the company shall not effect the exercise of this warrant, and the holder shall not have the right to exercise this warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. for purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of common stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of this warrant beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the company beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. for purposes of this warrant, in determining the number of outstanding shares of common stock, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of common stock as reflected in (1) the company's most recent form 10-ksb, form 10-qsb, current report on form 8-k or other public filing with the securities and exchange commission, as the case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the company or (3) any other notice by the company or the transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of common stock outstanding. for any reason at any time, upon the written request of the holder, the company shall within one business day confirm in writing to the holder the number of shares of common stock then outstanding. in any case, the number of outstanding shares of common stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the company, including the spa securities and the spa warrants, by the holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of common stock was reported. by written notice to the company, the holder may from time to time increase or decrease the maximum percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61 st ) day after such notice is delivered to the company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder and not to any other holder of spa warrants. &#160; -4- &#160; (2) &#160; market regulation . the company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of common stock upon exercise of this warrant, and the holder of this warrant shall not have the right to receive upon exercise of this warrant any shares of common stock, if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed that number of shares of common stock which the company may issue upon exercise, redemption or conversion, as applicable, of the spa warrants and spa securities or otherwise without breaching the company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the applicable eligible market (the number of shares which may be issued without violating such rules and regulations, the " exchange cap "), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the company (a) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the applicable eligible market for issuances of shares of common stock in excess of such amount or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the required holders. unless and until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no buyer shall be issued in the aggregate, upon exercise or conversion, as applicable, of any spa warrants or spa securities, shares of common stock in an amount greater than the product of the exchange cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of common stock underlying the spa warrants issued to such buyer pursuant to the securities purchase agreement on the issuance date and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of common stock underlying the spa warrants issued to the buyers pursuant to the securities purchase agreement on the issuance date (with respect to each buyer, the " exchange cap allocation "). in the event that any buyer shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such buyer's spa warrants, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such buyer's exchange cap allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the exchange cap allocation allocated to such transferee. in the event that any holder of spa warrants shall exercise all of such holder's spa warrants into a number of shares of common stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's exchange cap allocation, then the difference between such holder's exchange cap allocation and the number of shares of common stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective exchange cap allocations of the remaining holders of spa warrants on a pro rata basis in proportion to the shares of common stock underlying the spa warrants then held by each such holder. &#160; -5- &#160; (g) &#160; insufficient authorized shares . if at any time while any of the warrants remain outstanding the company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon exercise of the warrants at least a number of shares of common stock equal to 130% of the number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of all of the warrants then outstanding (the " required reserve amount ") (an " authorized share failure "), then the company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the company's authorized shares of common stock to an amount sufficient to allow the company to reserve the required reserve amount for the warrants then outstanding. without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an authorized share failure, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such authorized share failure, the company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. in connection with such meeting, the company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of common stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. &#160; 2. &#160; adjustment of exercise price and number of warrant shares . the exercise price and the number of warrant shares shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: &#160; (a) &#160; adjustment upon issuance of shares of common stock . if and whenever on or after the subscription date the company issues or sells, or in accordance with this section 2 is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of common stock owned or held by or for the account of the company, but excluding shares of common stock deemed to have been issued by the company in connection with any excluded securities (as defined in the spa securities) for a consideration per share (the " new issuance price ") less than a price equal to the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale (the " applicable price " and the foregoing a "dilutive issuance" ), then immediately after such dilutive issuance, the exercise price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the new issuance price . upon each such adjustment of the exercise price hereunder, the number of warrant shares shall be adjusted to the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of warrant shares acquirable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. for purposes of determining the adjusted exercise price under this section 2(a), the following shall be applicable: &#160; -6- &#160; (i) &#160; issuance of options . if the company in any manner grants any options and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of any such option is less than the applicable price, then such share of common stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the granting or sale of such option for such price per share. for purposes of this section 2(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon exercise of any such options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible securities issuable upon exercise of such option" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to any one share of common stock upon the granting or sale of the option, upon exercise of the option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible security issuable upon exercise of such option. no further adjustment of the exercise price or number of warrant shares shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of common stock or of such convertible securities upon the exercise of such options or upon the actual issuance of such shares of common stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such convertible securities. &#160; (ii) &#160; issuance of convertible securities . if the company in any manner issues or sells any convertible securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the applicable price, then such share of common stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company at the time of the issuance or sale of such convertible securities for such price per share. for the purposes of this section 2(a)(ii), the "lowest price per share for which one share of common stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange" shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the company with respect to one share of common stock upon the issuance or sale of the convertible security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such convertible security. no further adjustment of the exercise price or number of warrant shares shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of common stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such convertible securities, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustment of this warrant has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 2(a), no further adjustment of the exercise price or number of warrant shares shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. &#160; -7- &#160; (iii) &#160; change in option price or rate of conversion. if the purchase price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock increases or decreases at any time, the exercise price and the number of warrant shares in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the exercise price and the number of warrant shares which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. for purposes of this section 2(a)(iii), if the terms of any option or convertible security that was outstanding as of the date of issuance of this warrant are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such option or convertible security and the shares of common stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. no adjustment pursuant to this section 2(a) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the exercise price then in effect or a decrease in the number of warrant shares. &#160; (iv) &#160; calculation of consideration received . in case any option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integrated transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such options by the parties thereto, the options will be deemed to have been issued the difference of (x) the aggregate fair market value of such options and other securities issued or sold in such integrated transaction, less (y) the fair market value of the securities other than such option, issued or sold in such transaction and the other securities issued or sold in such integrated transaction will be deemed to have been issued or sold for the balance of the consideration received by the company. if any common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the gross amount raised by the company; provided, however, that such gross amount is not greater than 110% of the net amount received by the company therefor. if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company will be the closing sale price of such security on the date of receipt. if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of common stock, options or convertible securities, as the case may be. the fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined jointly by the company and the required holders. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the " valuation event "), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) business days after the tenth day following the valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the company and the required holders. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. &#160; -8- &#160; (v) &#160; record date . if the company takes a record of the holders of shares of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a)&#160;to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of common stock, options or in convertible securities or (b)&#160;to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be. &#160; (b) &#160; adjustment upon subdivision or combination of common stock . if the company at any time on or after the subscription date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of warrant shares will be proportionately increased. if the company at any time on or after the subscription date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased and the number of warrant shares will be proportionately decreased. any adjustment under this section 2(b) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. &#160; (c) &#160; other events . if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 2 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the company's board of directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the exercise price and the number of warrant shares so as to protect the rights of the holder; provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this section 2(c) will increase the exercise price or decrease the number of warrant shares as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 2. &#160; -9- &#160; 3. &#160; rights upon distribution of assets . if the company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of common stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a " distribution "), at any time after the issuance of this warrant, then, in each such case: &#160; (a) &#160; any exercise price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive the distribution shall be reduced, effective as of the close of business on such record date, to a price determined by multiplying such exercise price by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the closing bid price of the shares of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding such record date minus the value of the distribution (as determined in good faith by the company's board of directors) applicable to one share of shares of common stock, and (ii) the denominator shall be the closing bid price of the shares of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding such record date; and &#160; (b) &#160; the number of warrant shares shall be increased to a number of shares equal to the number of shares of common stock obtainable immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive the distribution multiplied by the reciprocal of the fraction set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (a); provided that in the event that the distribution is of shares of common stock (or common stock) (" other shares of common stock ") of a company whose common shares are traded on a national securities exchange or a national automated quotation system, then the holder may elect to receive a warrant to purchase other shares of common stock in lieu of an increase in the number of warrant shares, the terms of which shall be identical to those of this warrant, except that such warrant shall be exercisable into the number of shares of other shares of common stock that would have been payable to the holder pursuant to the distribution had the holder exercised this warrant immediately prior to such record date and with an aggregate exercise price equal to the product of the amount by which the exercise price of this warrant was decreased with respect to the distribution pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraph (a) and the number of warrant shares calculated in accordance with the first part of this paragraph (b). &#160; 4. &#160; purchase rights; fundamental transactions . &#160; (a) &#160; purchase rights . in addition to any adjustments pursuant to section 2 above, if at any time the company grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of common stock (the " purchase rights "), then the holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this warrant) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such purchase rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of common stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights. &#160; -10- &#160; (b) &#160; fundamental transactions . the company shall not enter into or be party to a fundamental transaction unless (i)&#160; the successor entity assumes in writing all of the obligations of the company under this warrant and the other transaction documents in accordance with the provisions of this section (4)(b) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the required holders and approved by the required holders prior to such fundamental transaction, including agreements to deliver to each holder of warrants in exchange for such warrants a security of the successor entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this warrant, including, without limitation, an adjusted exercise price equal to the value for the shares of common stock reflected by the terms of such fundamental transaction, and exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock equivalent to the shares of common stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this warrant) prior to such fundamental transaction, and reasonably satisfactory to the required holders and (ii)&#160;the successor entity (including its parent entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an eligible market. upon the occurrence of any fundamental transaction, the successor entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such fundamental transaction, the provisions of this warrant referring to the "company" shall refer instead to the successor entity), and may exercise every right and power of the company and shall assume all of the obligations of the company under this warrant with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named as the company herein. upon consummation of the fundamental transaction, the successor entity shall deliver to the holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon exercise of this warrant at any time after the consummation of the fundamental transaction, in lieu of the shares of the common stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the exercise of the warrant prior to such fundamental transaction , such shares of the publicly traded common stock (or its equivalent) of the successor entity (including its parent entity) which the holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such fundamental transaction had this warrant been converted immediately prior to such fundamental transaction, as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this warrant. in addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any fundamental transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock (a " corporate event "), the company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon an exercise of this warrant at any time after the consummation of the fundamental transaction but prior to the expiration date, in lieu of the shares of the common stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the exercise of the warrant prior to such fundamental transaction , such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights) which the holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such fundamental transaction had the warrant been exercised immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. the provisions of this section shall apply similarly and equally to successive fundamental transactions and corporate events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this warrant. &#160; -11- &#160; (c) &#160; notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of section 4(b) above, in the event of a change of control, if the holder has not exercised the warrant in full prior to the consummation of the change of control, then the holder shall have the right to require such successor entity to purchase this warrant from the holder by paying to the holder, simultaneously with the consummation of the change of control and in lieu of the warrant referred to in section 4(b) cash in the amount equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion of this warrant on the date of such consummation, which value shall be determined by use of the black-scholes option pricing model reflecting (i) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the u.s. treasury rate for a period equal to the remaining term of this warrant as of such date of request and (ii) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the hvt function on bloomberg; provided that if such function yields a volatility (x) less than 50%, the expected volatility shall be equal to 50% and (y) greater than 80%, the expected volatility shall be equal to 80%. &#160; 5. &#160; noncircumvention . the company hereby covenants and agrees that the company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this warrant and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the holder. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company (i)&#160;shall not increase the par value of any shares of common stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant above the exercise price then in effect, (ii)&#160;shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock upon the exercise of this warrant, and (iii) shall, so long as any of the spa warrants are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of the spa warrants, 130% of the number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of the spa warrants then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on exercise). &#160;

and (b) a presently exercisable and in-the-money option expiring may 31, 2011 to purchase from apollo up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock of the company presently owned of record by apollo at an exercise price equal to the lesser of (i) $1.50 per share or (ii) 80% of the average of the last reported sale prices of the common stock on each trading day during the 30 consecutive calendar days immediately preceding the effective date of exercise (the " apollo option "). &#160;

&#160; 3. under section 3(kk) of the securities purchase agreement, the company represented and warranted that all disclosure provided to the buyers regarding the company, its business and the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement and the other transaction documents, including the schedules to the securities purchase agreement, furnished by or on behalf of the company is true and correct and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. the company has breached section 3(kk) of the securities purchase agreement by (a)&#160;omitting the occurrence of the greenwich transaction on schedule 3(r), (b)&#160;materially misstating on schedule 3(r) that apollo beneficially owned 61.7% of the common stock of the company without qualification, notwithstanding the existence of the apollo notes and apollo options, and (c)&#160;omitting to disclose the greenwich transaction, including without limitation the apollo note and the apollo option, the bakrow warrant, the greenwich registration rights, and the bakrow registration rights. &#160; &#160; 4. the breaches of section 3(kk) of the securities purchase agreement described in the preceding paragraph also are breaches of section 3(k) of the securities purchase agreement. in section 3(k), the company represented and warranted that no information it had provided to the buyers that it had not filed with the sec contained any untrue statement of a material fact, or omitted to state any material fact the statement of which was necessary avoid being misleading. &#160; &#160; 5. under section 2(b) of the registration rights agreement, the company was required to disclose on schedule 2(b) to the registration rights agreement all agreements by the company to provide registration rights to any person with respect to common stock of the company. the company has breached section 2(b) of the registration rights agreement by failing to disclose on schedule 2(b) to the registration rights agreement the existence of the greenwich registration rights and the bakrow registration rights. &#160; &#160; &#160; august 18, 2006 page 4&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. the company has breached section 5(b) of the note by failing to disclose the occurrence of an event of default to the holders of each note within one business day after the occurrence thereof, as required by section 5(b). &#160; as a result of the occurrence of the above mentioned events of default, the undersigned hereby notifies the company of its election to exercise its redemption right pursuant to section 4(b) of the note and hereby submits this event of default redemption notice. the undersigned hereby elects to redeem the entire note in full at the aggregate event of default redemption price of $14,624,024. the company shall pay to the undersigned holder the event of default redemption price within five business days from the receipt of this event of default redemption notice pursuant to section 13(a) of the note. &#160;
