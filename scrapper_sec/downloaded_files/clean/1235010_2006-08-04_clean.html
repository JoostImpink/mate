provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under section&#160;10(c) for purposes of indemnification. the company and the selling holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section&#160;10 were determined solely by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section. notwithstanding the provisions of this section&#160;10(d), no holder shall be required to contribute an amount in excess of the net proceeds actually received by such holder in the relevant public offering, less the amount of any indemnification payment made by such indemnifying party pursuant to section&#160;10. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section&#160;11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; &#160; -13- table of contents &#160; (e) notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification contained in the underwriting agreements entered into among the holders, the company and the underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall be controlling as to the registrable shares included in the public offering. &#160; (f) the indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of the registrable shares by any such party. &#160; (g) the indemnification and contribution required by this section&#160;10 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. &#160; 11. &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; transfer of registration rights . &#160; the registration rights and obligations of the investor under this agreement with respect to any registrable shares may be transferred only to one or more affiliates of the investor;

12. &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; mergers, etc . &#160; the company shall not, directly or indirectly, enter into any merger, consolidation or reorganization in which the company shall not be the surviving corporation unless the proposed surviving corporation shall, prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization, agree in writing to assume the obligations of the company under this agreement to register registrable shares (but not any other obligations hereunder), and for that purpose references hereunder to &#8220;registrable shares&#8221; shall be deemed to be references to the securities which the holders would be entitled to receive in exchange for registrable shares under any such merger, consolidation or reorganization; provided, however, that the provisions of this agreement shall not apply in the event of any merger, consolidation or reorganization in which the company is not the surviving corporation if the holders of registrable shares are entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i)&#160;cash or (ii)&#160;securities of the acquiring corporation which may be immediately sold to the public without registration under the securities act. &#160;

&#160; (e) the existence of any fact which makes untrue any material statement made in the registration statement or prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or any free writing prospectus or the information conveyed to any purchaser at the time of sale to such purchaser or which requires the making of any changes in the registration statement or prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or any free writing prospectus or the information conveyed to any purchaser at the time of sale to such purchaser in order to make the statements therein not misleading (in which case the company will use its reasonable best efforts to amend the applicable document to correct the deficiency); or &#160; (f) in the event that, in the judgment of the company, it is advisable to suspend use of a prospectus included in a registration statement due to pending material developments or other events that have not yet been publicly disclosed and as to which the company believes public disclosure would be detrimental to the company; provided, however, that company may exercise its right to suspend the use of a prospectus included in an effective registration statement pursuant to this section&#160;13(f) or to delay filing a registration statement pursuant to section&#160;7(b)(iii) for an aggregate period not to exceed ninety (90)&#160;days in any 12-month period. &#160;

provided, however, that all officers and directors of the company and stockholders holding in excess of 5% of the common stock enter into similar agreements. any holder receiving any written notice from the company regarding the company&#8217;s plans to file a registration statement shall treat such notice confidentially and shall not disclose such information to any person. &#160; 16. &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; other registration rights agreements . &#160; the company agrees that if any other registration rights agreement entered into after the date of this agreement with respect to any of its securities contains terms which are more favorable to, or less restrictive on, the other party thereto than the terms and conditions contained in sections 2 through 10, section 12, section 13 and section 15 of this agreement are to the holders, then the company shall provide the holders the option to replace the terms and conditions contained in sections 2 through 10, section 12, section 13 and section 15 of this agreement in their entirety with the terms and conditions of such other registration right agreement relating to registration. &#160;
