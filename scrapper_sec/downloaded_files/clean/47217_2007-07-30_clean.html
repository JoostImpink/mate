delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of hp (&#147;purchaser&#148;), and opsware entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147;merger agreement&#148;). upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, purchaser, as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement (and in any event within ten (10) business days), will commence a cash tender offer (the &#147;offer&#148;) to purchase all outstanding shares at a price of $14.25 per share (the &#147;offer price&#148;), net to the seller in cash. following the completion of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger set forth in the merger agreement, (i) purchaser will be merged under delaware law into opsware (the &#147;merger&#148;), with opsware being the surviving corporation, (ii) each share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the offer (other than shares owned by hp or opsware or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive in cash an amount per share equal to the offer price and (iii) 3 each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of purchaser that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the surviving corporation. the offer, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, as set forth in the merger agreement. the merger agreement is attached as exhibit 1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. the purpose of the offer and the merger is to enable hp to acquire control of opsware by acquiring all of the outstanding shares. concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of hp and purchaser to enter into the merger agreement, certain directors and executive officers of opsware (and certain trust and limited partnership entities affiliated with certain of such persons) (the &#147;stockholders&#148;), in their capacity as stockholders of opsware, entered into tender and stockholder support agreements (collectively, the &#147;support agreements&#148;) with hp and purchaser, a copy of the form of which is attached hereto as exhibit 2 and is incorporated herein by reference. pursuant to the support agreements and as more fully described therein, each stockholder, among other things, (i) agreed to tender into the offer, and not withdraw, all shares of which he or she is the beneficial owner (including shares subsequently received due to the exercise of options or otherwise) or has the sole right to vote and dispose, and any shares over which such stockholder subsequently acquires beneficial ownership (the &#147;subject shares&#148;), (ii) agreed to vote any of his or her subject shares (a) in favor of the merger (including the adoption of the merger agreement); and (b) against any action or agreement which would materially impede or interfere with, or prevent, the merger, including, but not limited to, any other extraordinary corporate transaction, including, a merger, acquisition, sale, consolidation, reorganization or liquidation involving opsware and a third party, or any other acquisition transaction proposed by a third party, (iii) subject the subject shares to certain transfer restrictions and (iv) agreed that his or her representatives would not solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries or the making or submission of, any offer, proposal or indication of interest that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal. &#147;acquisition proposal&#148; means any inquiry, offer, proposal or indication of interest, whether or not in writing, as the case may be, by any person that relates to an acquisition transaction. &#147;acquisition transaction&#148; means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) involving (i) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other direct or indirect business combination involving opsware pursuant to which the stockholders of opsware immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the equity or voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii) the issuance or acquisition, directly or indirectly, of shares of any class of capital stock or other equity securities of (a) opsware representing more than fifteen percent (15%) (by ownership or voting power) of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of opsware by any person or &#147;group&#148; (as defined under section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;act&#148;)) or (b) any opsware subsidiary or subsidiaries whose assets constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of opsware and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or &#147;group&#148; (as defined under section 13(d) of the act) beneficially owning shares of any class of capital stock or other equity securities of opsware representing more than fifteen percent (15%) (by ownership or voting power) of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of opsware, (iv) the acquisition, license, lease, purchase or other disposition of assets that constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total assets (including equity securities of subsidiaries) of opsware and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than transactions in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. the support agreements terminate when and if the merger agreement is terminated without the consummation of the merger. hp did not pay any additional consideration to the stockholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the support agreements. the purpose of the support agreements is to increase the likelihood that the offer and the merger will be consummated. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, following the acceptance for payment by purchaser pursuant to the offer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares, and at all times thereafter, purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, of 4 the board of directors of opsware as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the opsware board of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by hp, purchaser and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of shares then outstanding. however, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall purchaser be entitled to elect or designate a majority of the opsware board of directors unless it is the beneficial owner of shares entitling it to exercise at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares. upon consummation of the merger, the directors and officers of purchaser shall be appointed as the directors and officers, respectively, of opsware until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with opsware&#146;s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. thereafter, hp intends to integrate opsware's business and operations with those of hp under the direction of hp&#146;s management. in addition, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of opsware will be amended and restated to become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of purchaser. upon the consummation of the offer, the shares may become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the act, and hp may cause them to be deregistered. upon the consummation of the merger, the shares will become eligible for such deregistration and hp will cause them to be deregistered. other than as described in this item 4, hp currently has no plans or proposals which relate to, or may result in, any of the matters listed in items 4(a)-(j) of schedule 13d. hp intends to continue to review opsware and its assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel, and to further consider, following consummation of the offer and the appointment of directors to the opsware board of directors, whether any changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances then existing, and reserves the right to take such actions or effect such changes as it deems desirable. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) not including shares that the stockholders may subsequently receive due to
