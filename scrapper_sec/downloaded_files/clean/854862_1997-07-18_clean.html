(e) payment of taxes. the company will pay all taxes and other governmental charges (other than taxed measured by the revenue or income of the holder) that may be imposed in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of stock upon exercise of this warrant certificate, provided, however, that the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because shares of stock are issued in a name other than such holder's. (f) notices of record date. in the event of (i) any taking by the company of a record of the holders of any class or series of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or (ii) any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the company, any merger or consolidation of the company, or any transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the company to any other corporation, entity or person, or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the company, the company shall mail to the holder at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (the "notice period"), a notice specifying (a) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (b) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (c) the time, if any is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of stock (or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. during the notice period, the holder shall have exercise rights provided elsewhere in this warrant certificate. (g) restrictions on exercise. notwithstanding the foregoing, this warrant certificate may not be exercised by, or -4- shares of stock issued to, the holder in any jurisdiction in which such exercise would be unlawful. 7. exercise price adjustments. the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth below, however, no adjustment in the exercise price need to be made pursuant to any of section 7(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the exercise price. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. (a) adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof effect a subdivision of the outstanding stock, the exercise price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, conversely, if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof reduce the outstanding shares of stock by combination or otherwise, the exercise price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased. any adjustment under this section 7(a) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effect. (b) adjustment of certain dividends and distributions of stock. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of stock, then and in each such event the exercise price then in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the exercise price then in effect by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date; and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance of the close of business on such record date, plus the number of shares of stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution, provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the exercise price shall be recompute accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the exercise price shall be adjusted pursuant to this section 7(b) as of -5- the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions. (c) adjustment for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the company other than shares of stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holder shall receive upon exercise of this warrant certificate in addition to the number of shares of stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the company that it would have received had this warrant certificate been exercised on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the exercise date, retained such securities receivable by it as aforesaid during such period giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this warrant certificate with respect to the rights of the holder. (d) adjustment for reclassification, exchange or substitution. if the stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant certificate shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reclassification, exchange, substitution or other change (other than a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for in section 7(e) below), then and in each such event, the holder shall have the right thereafter to exercise this warrant certificate into the kind and amounts of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other change, by holders of the number of shares of stock into which this warrant certificate might have been exercised immediately prior to such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (e) reorganization, mergers, consolidations or sales of assets. if at any time or from time to time there shall be a reorganization of the stock (other than a reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for in section 7(d) above) or a merger or consolidation of the company with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all the company's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this warrant certificate, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the company or of the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, to which a holder of that number of shares of stock deliverable upon exercise of this warrant certificate would have been entitled on such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the -6- provisions of this warrant certificate with respect to the rights of the holder after the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this warrant certificate (including adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant certificate) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. (f) certificate of adjustment. in each case of an adjustment or readjustment of the exercise price, the company, at its expense, shall prepare a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment signed by a duly elected officer of the company (the "adjustment certificate") and shall make the adjustment certificate, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holder at the holder's address as shown in the company's books. the adjustment certificate shall set forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based including a statement of the exercise price and the number of shares of stock or other securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant certificate immediately before and after giving effect to the applicable adjustment or readjustment. any determination as to whether an adjustment in the exercise price in effect hereunder is required pursuant to this section 7, or as to the amount of any such adjustment, if required, shall be binding upon the holder and the company if made in good faith by the board of directors of the company. 8. mutilated or missing warrant certificate. in case this warrant certificate shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the company will, upon request, issue and deliver in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated warrant
