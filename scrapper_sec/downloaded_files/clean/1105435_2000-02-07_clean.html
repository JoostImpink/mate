provided, that no lender will be required to extend the maturity date of the bridge loans beyond the tenth anniversary of the closing of the merger. the interest rate on the bridge loans increases each three months after the maturity date, up to a maximum rate. exchange notes mature on the tenth anniversary of the closing of the merger and bear interest at a fixed rate plus an applicable margin, up to a maximum rate. the definitive documentation for the bridge loans and exchange notes will contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for issuances of similar debt securities of this size and type. the definitive documentation will also require that the issuer use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause a shelf registration statement to become effective by the maturity date and to keep such registration statement effective for up to two years to permit resale of the exchange notes. item 4. purpose of transaction. the information set forth in item 3 above is incorporated herein by reference. the merger is being consummated to permit smc ii, together with the management stockholders, to acquire the issuer from the public stockholders of issuer and take issuer from being a public corporation to being a private corporation. after the merger, smc ii will indirectly control issuer through its control of holdings. page 13 of 19 pages 14 each of holdings, merger sub, smc ii, saw mill investments and mr. unger acquired beneficial ownership of 7,686,683 shares (representing approximately 37.61% of the outstanding common stock as of the date hereof) of the securities that are the subject of this filing upon the execution of a voting agreement, dated as of january 30, 2000, by and between merger sub, the management stockholders, janet d. martin and the martin family foundation. in the aggregate, as of the date hereof, mr. unger has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 7,805,592 shares of common stock representing approximately 38.2% of the total outstanding common stock. the management stockholders, mrs. martin and the foundation entered into the voting agreement in order to induce smc ii, merger sub and holdings to enter into the merger agreement. pursuant to the voting agreement, the management stockholders, mrs. martin and the foundation have agreed that at any meeting of stockholders of the issuer called for the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the "transactions") or a transaction involving the acquisition of a material portion of the assets or capital stock of the issuer other than the merger (a "third party transaction"), or in connection with any written consent of the holders of shares of the common stock, or in any other circumstances in which the management stockholders, mrs. martin or the foundation are entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, with respect to the merger agreement, the transactions or a third party transaction, to vote (or cause to be voted) the shares of common stock of issuer held by the management stockholders, mrs. martin and the foundation at the direction of merger sub with respect to such transactions. the management stockholders, mrs. martin and the foundation also agreed pursuant to the voting agreement that at any meeting of stockholders of the issuer, or in connection with any written consent of the holders of shares of issuer's common stock to vote (or cause to be voted) the shares of common stock of issuer held by the management stockholders, mrs. martin and the foundation against the following actions (1) any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the issuer or the management stockholders under the merger agreement or of the management stockholders, mrs. martin or the foundation under the voting agreement;
