(c) except as described above, there have been no transactions in shares of norwich common stock by people's or people's mutual holdings or, to the best knowledge of people's, any of people's executive officers or directors or people's mutual holdings' executive officers or trustees during the past 60 days.

(d) issuer shall notify grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any preliminary purchase event or purchase event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by issuer shall not be a condition to the right of holder to exercise the option.

(b) at each closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds and surrender of this agreement as provided in section 4(a), (i) issuer shall deliver to holder (a) a certificate or certificates representing the option shares to be purchased at such closing, which option shares shall be free and clear of all liens and subject to no preemptive rights, and (b), if the option is exercised in part only, an executed new agreement with the same terms as this agreement evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the shares of issuer common purchasable hereunder, and (ii) holder shall deliver to issuer a letter agreeing that holder shall not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such option shares in violation of applicable federal and state law or of the provisions of this agreement. (c) in addition to any other legend that is required by applicable law, certificates for the option shares delivered at each closing shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend which shall read substantially as follows: the transfer of the stock represented by this certificate is subject to restrictions arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and pursuant to the terms of a stock option agreement dated september 3, 1997. a copy of such agreement will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by the issuer of a written request therefor. it is understood and agreed that the portion of the above legend relating to the securities act shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such legend if holder shall have delivered to issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the sec, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act.

(d) no violations. the execution, delivery and performance of this agreement does not or will not, and the consummation by issuer of any of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (a) a breach or violation of, or a default under, its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or (b) a breach or violation of, or a default under, any agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation of it or any of its subsidiaries (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) or under any law, rule, ordinance or regulation or judgment, decree, order, award or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which it or any of its subsidiaries is subject, that would in any case give any other person the ability to prevent or enjoin issuer's performance under this agreement in any material respect. 6. representations and warranties of grantee. grantee hereby represents and warrants to issuer that grantee has full corporate power and authority to enter into this agreement and, subject to obtaining the approvals referred to in this agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement; the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of grantee; and this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by grantee. 7. adjustment upon changes in issuer capitalization, etc. (a) in the event of any change in issuer common by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the option, and the purchase price therefor, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that holder shall receive, upon exercise of the option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that holder would have received in respect of issuer common if the option had been exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record date therefor, as applicable. if any additional shares of issuer common are issued after the date of this agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in the first sentence of this section 7(a), upon exercise of any option to purchase issuer common outstanding on the date hereof or upon conversion into issuer common of any convertible security of issuer outstanding on the date hereof), the number of shares of issuer common subject to the option shall be adjusted so that, after such issuance, it, together with any shares of issuer common previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 19.9% of the number of 7 shares of issuer common then issued and outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the option. no provision of this section 7 shall be deemed to affect or change, or constitute authorization for any violation of, any of the covenants or representations in the merger agreement. (b) in the event that issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of issuer common shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of issuer or any other person or cash or any other property or the outstanding shares of issuer common immediately prior to such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any person, other than grantee or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so that the option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of holder, of either (x) the acquiring corporation (as hereinafter defined), (y) any person that controls the acquiring corporation, or (z) in the case of a merger described in clause (ii), issuer (such person being referred to as "substitute option issuer"). (c) the substitute option shall have the same terms as the option, provided, that, if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to holder. substitute option issuer shall also enter into an agreement with holder in substantially the same form as this agreement, which shall be applicable to the substitute option. (d) the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of substitute common (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the assigned value (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares of issuer common for which the option was theretofore exercisable, but not exercised as of the date of the transaction giving rise to the substitute option, divided by the average price (as hereinafter defined). the exercise price of the substitute option per share of substitute common (the "substitute option price") shall then be equal to the purchase price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of issuer common for which the option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares of the substitute common for which the substitute option is exercisable. (e) the following terms have the meanings indicated: (1) "acquiring corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with issuer (if other than issuer), (ii) issuer in a 8 merger in which issuer is the continuing or surviving person, or (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of issuer's assets (or a substantial part of the assets of its subsidiaries taken as a whole). (2) "substitute common" shall mean the shares of capital stock (or similar equity interest) with the greatest voting power in respect of the election of directors (or persons similarly responsible for the direction of the business and affairs) of the substitute option issuer. (3) "assigned value" shall mean the highest of (w) the price per share of issuer common at which a tender offer or an exchange offer therefor has been made, (x) the price per share of issuer common to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with issuer, (y) the highest closing price for shares of issuer common within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the consolidation, merger, or sale in question and (z) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of issuer's assets or deposits an amount equal to (i) the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets (and/or deposits) and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer, as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer divided by (ii) the number of shares of issuer common outstanding at such time. in the event that a tender offer or an exchange offer is made for issuer common or an agreement is entered into for a merger or consolidation involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities or other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for issuer common shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer. (4) "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of substitute common for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger, or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of substitute common on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by issuer, the person merging into issuer or by any company which controls such person, as holder may elect. (f) in no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the substitute option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of substitute common outstanding prior to exercise of the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of substitute common but for the limitation in the first sentence of this section 7(f), substitute option issuer shall make a cash payment to holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in the first sentence of this section 7(f) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in the 9 first sentence of this section 7(f). this difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to substitute option issuer. (g) issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in section 7(b) unless the acquiring corporation and any person that controls the acquiring corporation assume in writing all the obligations of issuer hereunder and take all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this section 7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action that may be necessary so that the holders of the other shares of common stock issued by substitute option issuer are not entitled to exercise any rights by reason of the issuance or exercise of the substitute option and the shares of substitute common are otherwise in no way distinguishable from or have lesser economic value (other than any diminution in value resulting from the fact that the substitute common are restricted securities, as defined in rule 144 under the securities act or any successor provision) than other shares of common stock issued by substitute option issuer). 8. repurchase at the option of holder. (a) subject to the last sentence of section 3(a) and receipt of any required regulatory approvals as hereinafter set forth, at the request of holder at any time commencing upon the first occurrence of a repurchase event (as defined in section 8(d)) and ending twelve (12) months immediately thereafter, issuer shall repurchase from holder (i) the option, and (ii) all shares of issuer common purchased by holder pursuant hereto with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership. the date on which holder exercises its rights under this section 8 is referred to as the "request date". such repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "section 8 repurchase consideration") equal to the sum of: (i) the aggregate purchase price paid by holder for any shares of issuer common acquired pursuant to the option with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership; (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the applicable price (as defined below) for each share of issuer common over (y) the purchase price (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7), multiplied by the number of shares of issuer common with respect to which the option has not been exercised; and (iii) the excess, if any, of the applicable price over the purchase price (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7) paid (or, in the case of option shares with respect to which the option has been exercised but the closing date has not occurred, payable) by holder for each share of issuer common with respect to which the option has been exercised and with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of such shares. 10 (b) if holder exercises its rights under this section 8, issuer shall, within ten (10) business days after the request date, pay the section 8 repurchase consideration to holder in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment, holder shall surrender to issuer the option and the certificates evidencing the shares of issuer common purchased thereunder with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, and holder shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all liens. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or approval of any regulatory authority is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration, holder shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such approval). if any regulatory authority disapproves of any part of issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this section 8, issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to holder. if any regulatory authority prohibits the repurchase in part but not in whole, then holder shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request, or (ii) to the extent permitted by such regulatory authority, to determine whether the repurchase should apply to the option and/or option shares and to what extent to each, and holder shall thereupon have the right to exercise the option as to the number of option shares for which the option was exercisable at the request date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to section 8(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the option (if any) that has been repurchased. holder shall notify issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within five (5) business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all of holder's rights under this section 8 shall terminate on the date of termination of this option pursuant to section 3(a). (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "applicable price" means the highest of (i) the highest price per share of issuer common paid for any such share by the person or groups described in section 8(d)(i), (ii) the price per share of issuer common received by holders of issuer common in connection with any merger or other business combination transaction described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii), or (iii) the highest closing sales price per share of issuer common on nasdaq (or if issuer common is not traded on nasdaq, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by holder) during the forty (40) business days preceding the request date; provided, however, that in the event of a sale of less than all of issuer's assets, the applicable price shall be the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer, divided by the number of shares of the 11 issuer common outstanding at the time of such sale. if the consideration to be offered, paid or received pursuant to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be other than in cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes of this agreement. (d) as used herein, "repurchase event" shall occur if (i) any person (other than grantee or any subsidiary of grantee) shall have acquired beneficial ownership of (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the exchange act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of issuer common, or (ii) any of the transactions described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii) shall be consummated. 9. registration rights. (a) demand registration rights. from and after the occurrence of a purchase event, issuer shall, subject to the conditions of section 9(c) below, if requested by any holder, including grantee and any permitted transferee ("selling shareholder"), as expeditiously as possible prepare and file a registration statement under the securities act if such registration is necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of issuer common or other securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to the selling shareholder upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the selling shareholder in such request, including without limitation a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 under the securities act or any successor provision, and issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares or other securities for sale under any applicable state securities laws. (b) additional registration rights. if issuer at any time after the exercise of the option proposes to register any shares of issuer common under the securities act in connection with an underwritten public offering of such issuer common, issuer will promptly give written notice to the selling shareholders of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of any selling shareholder given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of issuer common intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by the selling shareholder), issuer will cause all such shares for which a selling shareholder requests participation in such registration to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, however, that issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if the underwriters in good faith object for valid business reasons, or (ii) in the case of a registration solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on form s-4 of the securities act or any successor form; provided, further, however, that such election pursuant to (i) may only be made two times. if some but not all the shares of issuer common, with respect to which issuer shall have received 12 requests for registration pursuant to this section 9(b), shall be excluded from such registration, issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be registered among the selling shareholders desiring to register their shares pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be registered by each such selling shareholder bears to the total number of shares requested to be registered by all such selling shareholders then desiring to have issuer common registered for sale. (c) conditions to required registration. issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each registration statement referred to in section 9(a) above to become effective and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective; provided, however, that issuer may delay any registration of option shares required pursuant to section 9(a) above for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days provided issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would adversely affect an offering or contemplated offering of other securities by issuer, and issuer shall not be required to register option shares under the securities act pursuant to section 9(a) above: (i) on more than one occasion during any calendar year; (ii) within ninety (90) days after the effective date of a registration referred to in section 9(b) above pursuant to which the selling shareholder or selling shareholders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register such shares under the securities act and such shares were registered as requested; and (iii) unless a request therefor is made to issuer by selling shareholders that hold at least 25% or more of the aggregate number of option shares (including shares of issuer common issuable upon exercise of the option) then outstanding. in addition to the foregoing, issuer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement after the expiration of nine (9) months from the effective date of such registration statement. issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of the option shares so registered in accordance with the intended method of distribution for such shares; provided, however, that issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. (d) expenses. except where applicable state law prohibits such payments, issuer will pay all expenses (including without limitation registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel), legal expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose option shares are being registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions but including liability insurance if issuer so 13 desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to section 9(a) or 9(b) above (including the related offerings and sales by holders of option shares) and all other qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to section 9(a) or 9(b) above. (e) indemnification. in connection with any registration under section 9(a) or 9(b) above, issuer hereby indemnifies the selling shareholders, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and issuer and each officer, director and controlling person of issuer shall be indemnified by such selling shareholders, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue statement that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such holder or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use. promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this section 9(e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this section 9(e), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this section 9(e). in case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party either agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more 14 legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees and expenses of such counsel. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnification provided for in this section 9(e) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by issuer, the selling shareholders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of issuer, the selling shareholders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall any selling shareholder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its option shares included in the offering. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. any obligation by any holder to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other holders. in connection with any registration pursuant to section 9(a) or 9(b) above, issuer and each selling shareholder (other than grantee) shall enter into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of this section 9(e). (f) miscellaneous reporting. issuer shall comply with all reporting requirements and will do all such other things as may be necessary to permit the expeditious sale at any time of any option shares by the selling shareholders thereof in accordance with and to the extent permitted by any rule or regulation promulgated by the sec from time to time, including, without limitation, rule 144a. issuer shall at its expense provide the selling shareholders with any information necessary in connection with the completion and filing of any reports or forms required to be filed by them under the securities act or the exchange act, or required pursuant to any state securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange. (g) issue taxes. issuer will pay all stamp taxes in connection with the issuance and the sale of the option shares and in connection with the exercise of the option, and will 15 save the selling shareholders harmless, without limitation as to time, against any and all liabilities with respect to all such taxes. 10. quotation listing. if issuer common or any other securities to be acquired in connection with the exercise of the option are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on any securities exchange, issuer, upon the request of holder, will promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation or trading or listing the shares of issuer common or other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option on such securities exchange and will use its best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation or listing as soon as practicable. 11. division of option. this agreement (and the option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of holder, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of issuer for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of issuer common purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used herein include any other agreements and related options for which this agreement (and the option granted hereby) may be exchanged. upon receipt by issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of issuer, whether or not the agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 12. limitation on total profit and notional total profit. (a) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall grantee's total profit (as defined below in section 12(c) hereof) exceed $3 million and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of issuer common subject to the option, (ii) deliver to issuer for cancellation option shares previously purchased by grantee, (iii) pay cash to issuer, or (iv) any combination thereof, so that grantee's actually realized total profit shall not exceed $3 million after taking into account the foregoing actions. (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a notional total profit (as defined below in section 14(d) hereof) of more than $3 million; provided, that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the option permitted hereby on any subsequent date. 16 (c) as used herein, the term "total profit" shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by grantee pursuant to issuer's repurchase of the option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to section 8 hereof, (ii)(x) the amount received by grantee pursuant to issuer's repurchase of option shares pursuant to section 8 hereof, less (y) grantee's purchase price for such option shares, (iii)(x) the net cash amounts received by grantee pursuant to the sale of option shares (or any other securities into which such option shares shall be converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (y) grantee's purchase price of such option shares, (iv) any amounts received by grantee on the transfer of the option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, and (v) any equivalent amount with respect to the substitute option. (d) as used herein, the term "notional total profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which grantee may propose to exercise the option shall be the total profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that the option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other option shares held by grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the issuer common as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). (e) grantee agrees, promptly following any exercise of all or any portion of the option, and subject to its rights under section 8 hereof, to use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to maximize the value of option shares purchased taking into account market conditions, the number of option shares, the potential negative impact of substantial sales on the market price for issuer common, and the availability of an effective registration statement to permit public sale of option shares. 13. miscellaneous.
