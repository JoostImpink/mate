"merger agreement"), whereby, subject to the conditions stated therein, (i) enron merger sub will merge with and into enron, with enron surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of newco (the "enron merger"), and (ii) dynegy merger sub will merge with and into dynegy, with dynegy surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of newco (collectively with the enron merger, the "mergers"). at the effective time of the mergers, (1) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par value, of enron will be converted into 0.2685 shares (the "enron merger ratio") of class a common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of newco ("newco class a common stock"), and (2) each issued and outstanding share of class a common stock, no par value, of dynegy and each outstanding share of class b common stock, no par value, of dynegy will be converted into one share of newco class a common stock and one share of class b common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of newco, respectively. under the merger

agreement provides that dynegy or enron may be required to pay a termination fee of $350 million to the other party under certain circumstances relating to competing transactions or a change in the

outstanding shares of series b preferred stock at the redemption price on the second anniversary of the issuance of the series b preferred stock. in this instance, dynegy may not redeem the shares prior to the second anniversary of the issuance of the series b preferred stock. the series b preferred stock will not accrue any dividend unless the mergers close and chevron exercises the chevron out. then, chevron will be entitled to receive a special one-time dividend at 7% per annum for the period starting on the date on which dynegy issued the series b preferred stock and ending on the date on which chevron exercised the chevron out. dynegy will pay this special dividend on the applicable redemption date. in addition, chevron will be entitled to receive a regular quarterly dividend equal to 7% per annum for the period starting on the closing of the mergers and ending on the redemption date. first amendment to registration rights agreement. in connection with chevrontexaco's

enron and chevron have entered into a stockholder agreement that will govern certain aspects of their relationship before and after the mergers. this agreement is similar to the shareholder agreement, dated as of june 14, 1999, among dynegy, illinova corporation, dynegy holdings inc. and chevron. the key differences between the dynegy shareholder agreement and the newco stockholder agreement are that under the newco stockholder agreement (1) chevron is entitled to elect the greater of three directors and 20% of newco's board of directors, if newco's board is increased in size, and (2) newco is not prohibited from owning an interest in a nuclear facility. 11 this agreement will terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement and chevron's ceasing to own certain specified thresholds of newco common stock. newco registration rights agreement. newco has granted chevron registration rights, which are similar to those contained in the registration rights agreement, dated as of june 14, 1999, between dynegy and chevron, for the newco class a common stock underlying the newco class b common stock that chevron will own following the mergers. this agreement will terminate upon the first such instance when chevron (including its affiliates) ceases to own at least one percent (1%) of newco's outstanding common stock (treating the newco class b common stock as if it had been converted into newco class a common stock in accordance with its terms). exhibits and incorporation by reference. the class b common stock subscription agreement (including the forms of the series a
