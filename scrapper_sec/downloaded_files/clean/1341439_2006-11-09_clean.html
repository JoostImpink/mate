(&#147;oracle&#148;), oracle systems corporation, a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of oracle (&#147;osc&#148;) and star acquisition corp., a minnesota corporation and wholly-owned

director and officer who may be a controlling person) of oracle, osc and star is set forth on schedule a. during the last five years, none of oracle, osc and star, and to the knowledge of oracle, osc and star, any of the persons listed on schedule a attached hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on november 2, 2006, issuer, osc and star entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147;merger agreement&#148;), pursuant to which star will commence a tender offer (the &#147;offer&#148;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares for $13.50 per share, in cash, and, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the offer and the merger agreement, after consummation of the offer, star will merge with and into issuer (the &#147;merger&#148;), whereupon star&#146;s separate corporate existence will cease and issuer will continue as the surviving corporation and as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of osc. as an inducement to enter into the merger agreement, and in consideration thereof, osc and star entered into a tender and support agreement (the &#147;tender and support agreement&#148;) with each of the directors and executive officers of issuer, consisting of the following: &#149; robert f. olson &#149; william b. binch &#149; kenneth h. holec &#149; alan b. menkes &#149; darin p. mcareavey &#149; frank a. radichel &#149; daniel p. ryan &#149; philip e. soran &#149; raymond a. tucker (each a &#147;shareholder&#148;), dated as of the date of the merger agreement. pursuant to the tender and support agreement, each shareholder has agreed to tender his shares in the offer, within two business days after commencement of the offer, and not to withdraw such tender unless the offer shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. pursuant to this agreement, each shareholder who owns any escrow shares (as page 5 of 12 pages table of contents defined in the tender and support agreement) concurrently with his entry into the tender and support agreement entered into an escrow agreement (the &#147;escrow agreement&#148;) with osc, star and an escrow agent, providing for the delivery of such shareholder&#146;s shares to the escrow agent for purposes of being tendered into the offer, within two business days after commencement of the offer. in addition, pursuant to the tender and support agreement, each shareholder granted to the officers of osc an irrevocable proxy to, at any meeting of the shareholders of issuer called to vote upon the merger and the merger agreement, and at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval with respect to the merger and the merger agreement is sought, vote and exercise all voting and related rights of such shareholder of its beneficially held shares in favor of the adoption by issuer of the merger and the approval of the merger agreement and each of the transactions contemplated thereby. in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, issuer has entered into an amendment (&#147;first amendment to rights agreement&#148;) dated as of the date of the merger agreement to the rights agreement, dated as of may 29, 2002, between issuer and wells fargo bank minnesota, n.a., as rights agent (the &#147;rights agreement&#148;), which rendered the rights agreement inapplicable to the merger agreement, the tender and support agreement, the escrow agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger. the proposed transaction is valued at approximately $450 million (based on a fully-diluted equity value). star and osc expect to fund the consideration payable pursuant to the offer and the merger using oracle&#146;s and osc&#146;s internally available cash and securities and cash generated from operations. shared voting power with respect to the shares owned by the shareholders may be deemed to have been acquired through execution of the tender and support agreement. oracle, osc and star have not expended any funds in connection with the execution of the tender and support agreement. schedule b attached hereto contains the names and number of shares beneficially held by each shareholder. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement, the tender and support agreement, the escrow agreement and the first amendment to rights agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. a copy of the merger agreement is attached as exhibit 1 to this schedule 13d. a copy of the form of tender and support agreement is attached as exhibit 2 to this schedule 13d. a copy of the form of escrow agreement is attached as exhibit 3 to this schedule 13d. a copy of the first amendment to rights agreement is attached as exhibit 4 to this schedule 13d. item 4. purpose of transaction. as described in item 3 above, this statement is being filed in connection with the tender and support agreement among osc, star and each shareholder party thereto in connection with the offer, the merger and the related merger agreement. as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, star will commence the offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares for $13.50 per share, in cash. subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the offer, after consummation of the offer, osc shall cause the merger to occur. upon the consummation of the merger, (i) issuer will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of osc and (ii) each share which has not been purchased pursuant to the offer will be converted into the right to receive $13.50 in cash, subject to certain exceptions more fully described in the merger agreement. in addition, options to acquire shares and restricted share awards in respect of shares, each outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will, upon consummation of the merger, be converted into options to acquire shares of oracle common stock, and restricted share awards in respect of oracle stock, each based on an exchange ratio contained in the merger agreement. page 6 of 12 pages table of contents from and after the effective time of the merger and pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) daniel cooperman, the sole director of star, will serve as director of issuer until one or more successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (ii) the officers of star immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the officers of issuer until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (iii) the certificate of incorporation of the issuer will be amended at the effective time of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement and, as so amended, will be the

(c) except for the agreements described above, to the knowledge of oracle, osc and star, no transactions in the class of securities reported have been effected during the past 60 days by any person named in schedule a or item 5(a). (d) to the knowledge of oracle, osc and star, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities of issuer reported herein. (e) inapplicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except for the agreements described above, to the knowledge of oracle, osc and star, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise), including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder&#146;s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, between the persons enumerated in item 2, and any other person, with respect to any securities of issuer, including any securities pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or investment power over such securities other than standard default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements. page 7 of 12 pages table of contents item 7. material to be filed as exhibits.
