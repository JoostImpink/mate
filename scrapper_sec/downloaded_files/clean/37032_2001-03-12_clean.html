("james river") as to the shares covered by the option. the option may only be exercised upon the happening of certain events referred to in item 4, none of which has occurred as of the date hereof. first virginia expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any of the shares of common stock of james river which are purchasable by first virginia upon exercise of the option. ** the percentage indicated represents the percentage of the total outstanding shares of common stock of james river as of march 3, 2001, taking into consideration the 906,680 shares of james river common stock issuable pursuant to the option. for the reasons discussed in the footnote above, first virginia expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any of the shares of common stock of james river which are purchasable by first virginia upon exercise of the option. item 1. security and issuer. this statement relates to the common stock of james river, $5.00 par value per share ("james river common stock"). james river is a virginia corporation whose principal executive offices are located at 1514 holland road, suffolk, virginia 23434. item 2. identity and background. this statement is being filed by first virginia, a virginia chartered bank holding company whose principal executive offices are located at 6400 arlington boulevard, falls church, virginia 22042. to the best of first virginia's knowledge, during the last five years, neither first virginia nor any of its directors or executive officers has been convicted in any criminal proceedings (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) nor has first virginia or any of its directors or executive officers been a party to any civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. attached hereto is an appendix to item 2 setting forth certain additional information concerning the directors and executive officers of first virginia. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. it is presently anticipated that shares of james river common stock as described in item 4 would be purchased with working capital funds of first virginia. item 4. purpose of transaction. pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization, dated as of march 3, 2001 (the "agreement"), by and between first virginia and james river, and in consideration thereof, james river issued an option to first virginia on march 3, 2001 (the "option") to purchase, under certain conditions, up to 906,680 shares (the "option shares") of james river common stock subject to adjustment under certain circumstances at a purchase price of $17.00 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to anti-dilution provisions (the "purchase price"). the option was issued to first virginia pursuant to a stock option agreement, dated as of march 3, 2001 (the "option agreement"), between first virginia and james river. the agreement provides, among other things, for the merger of james river with and into first virginia, with first virginia as the corporation surviving from the merger (the "merger"). upon consummation of the merger, which is subject to the approval of the james river stockholders, regulatory approvals, satisfactory completion of an audit by first virginia of james river and its subsidiaries and the satisfaction or waiver of various other terms and conditions, each share of james river common stock (excluding treasury shares) issued and outstanding shall be converted into .51 shares of the common stock of first virginia, $1.00 par value per share ("first virginia common stock") (the "exchange ratio"). in lieu of receiving first virginia common stock, holders of james river common stock may elect to exchange their shares for $24.00 per share in cash, provided that the number of shares that may be exchanged for cash, including shares held by dissenting stockholders, shall not exceed 40% of the shares of james river common stock outstanding immediately prior to consummation of the merger. if (i) first virginia is not in material breach of the option agreement or the agreement, and (ii) no injunction against delivery of the shares covered by the option is in effect, first virginia may exercise the option in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time following the happening of certain events (each a "purchase event") and prior to the termination of the option, including, among others: (a) james river shall have authorized, recommended, publicly proposed or publicly announced an intention to authorize, recommend or propose, or entered into an agreement with any person (other than first virginia or any subsidiary of first virginia) to effect (each an "acquisition transaction") (1) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving james river or its subsidiaries (with certain exceptions), (2) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of 20 percent or more of the consolidated assets of james river and its subsidiaries, or (3) the issuance, sale or other disposition of 20 percent or more of the voting securities of james river or any of its subsidiaries; or (b) any third party (other than first virginia or any subsidiary of first virginia) acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of james river common stock; provided, the option will terminate upon the earliest of: (i) the effective time; (ii) termination of the agreement (other than as a result of a willful breach of any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant by james river (each a "default termination")) prior to the occurrence of a purchase event or a preliminary purchase event; (iii) 12 months after the termination of the agreement by first virginia pursuant to a default termination; or (iv) 12 months after termination of the agreement following the occurrence of a purchase event or a preliminary purchase event. for purposes of the option agreement, the term "preliminary purchase event" is defined as (a) the commencement by any third party of a tender or exchange offer to purchase 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of james river common stock, or (b) the occurrence of certain circumstances surrounding the failure of the stockholders of james river to approve the agreement, the failure to hold a meeting of the james river stockholders to approve the agreement, or the withdrawal or modification in a manner adverse to first virginia, of the recommendation of james river's board of directors with respect to the agreement. the option agreement also sets forth that a holder's (including first virginia's) total profit relating to the option may not exceed $4 million and that the option may not be exercised for a number of shares of james river common stock as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a notional total profit of more than $4 million. for purposes of the option agreement, the term "total profit" shall mean the aggregate sum (prior to the payment of taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by the holder pursuant to james river's repurchase of the option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to terms set forth in the option agreement; (ii) (a) the amount received by the holder pursuant to james river's repurchase of option shares under the option agreement, less (b) the holder's purchase price for such option shares; (iii) (a) the net cash amounts received by the holder pursuant to the sale of option shares (or any other securities into which such option shares shall be converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated person, less (b) the holder's purchase price of such option shares; and (iv) any amounts received by the holder on the transfer of the option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated person. for purposes of the option agreement, the term "notional total profit" with respect to any number of shares of james river common stock as to which first virginia may propose to exercise the option shall be the total profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise, assuming that the option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other option shares held by first virginia and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing sale price per share of james river common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market (or, if james river common stock is not then quoted on the nasdaq national market, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by first virginia) as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions). at the request of first virginia at any time, beginning on the first occurrence of certain events (each a "repurchase event"), including, among others, the acquisition by a third party of 50 percent or more of the outstanding shares of james river common stock, and ending upon the earlier of 18 months immediately thereafter or termination of the option, james river will repurchase from first virginia (i) the option, and (ii) all shares of james river common stock purchased by first virginia pursuant to the option agreement, at a specified price. upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the option agreement generally relating to the merger of james river with, or sale by james river of substantially all of its assets to, a third party (other than first virginia or a subsidiary of first virginia), the option must be converted into, or exchanged for, an option, at the election of first virginia, of the acquiring corporation or any person that controls the acquiring corporation (the "substitute option"). the terms of any such substitute option are set forth in the option agreement. a copy of the agreement and the option agreement is incorporated by reference herein as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively, and the foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. item 5. interest in securities of james river. the 906,680 shares of james river common stock which are purchasable by first virginia upon exercise of the option are equal to approximately 19.9 percent of james river common stock, based on the 4,556,219 shares of james river common stock issued and outstanding on march 3, 2001, before taking into consideration the 906,680 shares of james river common stock that would be issued pursuant to the option. the option contains anti-dilution provisions which provide that the number of shares of james river common stock issuable upon exercise of the option and the purchase price will be adjusted upon the happening of certain events, including the payment of a stock dividend or other distribution in james river common stock or the subdivision or reclassification of james river common stock, as set forth in the option agreement. if any additional shares of james river common stock are issued after the date of the option agreement other than those described in the preceding sentence and shares issued upon exercise of the option, the number of shares subject to the option (taking into account the shares previously issued pursuant to the option), shall be adjusted so that such number of shares following such issuance shall not exceed the lesser of (i) 19.9 percent of the number of shares of james river common stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to the option, and (ii) that minimum number of shares of james river common stock which when aggregated with any other shares of james river common stock beneficially owned by first virginia or any affiliate thereof would cause the provisions of certain virginia takeover laws to be applicable to the merger. first virginia expressly disclaims any beneficial ownership of the shares of james river common stock which are purchasable by first virginia upon exercise of the option because the option is exercisable only in the circumstances referred to in item 4 above, none of which has occurred as of this date. other than as set forth in this item 5 and except with respect to 5,554 shares of james river common stock held by a first virginia subsidiary in a fiduciary capacity, to the best of first virginia's knowledge (i) neither first virginia nor any subsidiary or affiliate of first virginia or any of its or their executive officers or directors beneficially owns any shares of james river common stock, and (ii) there have been no transactions in the shares of james river common stock effected during the past 60 days by first virginia, nor to the best of first virginia's knowledge, by any subsidiary or affiliate of first virginia or any of its or their executive officers or directors. no other person is known by first virginia to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the james river common stock obtainable by first virginia upon exercise of the option. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of james river. other than the agreement, including the option agreement, a copy of which (excluding certain exhibits) is incorporated by reference herein, to the best of first virginia's knowledge there are at present no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 above and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of james river. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. the agreement and the option agreement are filed herewith as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively. signature. after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. first virginia

exchange--composite transactions" or any comparable heading then in use, for each of the last ten trading days ending on the effective date of the merger. holders of shares of james river common stock

exchangeable for the right to receive the consideration provided in section 1.1 of this agreement, unless and until such holder shall fail to perfect his right to receive payment of such fair value or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right. if such holder shall have so failed to perfect his right to receive payment of such fair value or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such

(b) holders of shares of james river common stock will be given the option of exchanging their shares for $24.00 per share in cash, provided that the number of shares that may be exchanged for cash, when added to dissenting shares (as defined in section 1.3), shall not exceed 40% of the shares of james river common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date. the cash election must be made no later than the time james river stockholders vote on the merger and once such vote has been taken, cash elections shall be irrevocable. if the aggregate of (i) shares for which a cash election is made and (ii) dissenting shares exceed 40% of the shares of james river common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, first virginia first will pay cash for shares submitted for cash exchange by each holder of 100 or fewer shares of james river common stock (if such holder has submitted all his shares for cash exchange) and then will pay cash for shares submitted for cash pro rata. shares not exchanged for cash after proration will be exchanged for first virginia common stock at the exchange ratio provided above. stockholders who elect to exchange some or all of their shares of james river common stock for cash must elect cash at or prior to the meeting of james river stockholders called to consider the merger. if the merger is approved by james river stockholders at this meeting, a stockholder's election to receive cash is irrevocable.

certificate or certificates so surrendered shall have been exchanged as provided in the agreement and this plan of merger, or cash if the cash option provided above is properly elected, or in the event of a pro rata cash payment as provided above, a combination of cash and first virginia common stock. until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate which, prior to the effective date of the merger, represented james river common stock, will be deemed evidence of the right to receive either (i) the number of full shares of first virginia common stock into which the number of shares of james river common stock formerly represented thereby may be converted in accordance with the exchange ratio provided above, or (ii) $24.00 cash per share multiplied by the number of shares of james river common stock formerly represented by such certificate if the cash option provided above was properly elected, or (iii) a combination thereof as provided above; and after the effective date of

into which the shares of james river common stock formerly represented thereby were converted. with respect to shares of first virginia common stock into which shares of james river common stock are converted pursuant to the merger, until such outstanding certificates formerly representing james river common stock are surrendered, no dividend payable to holders of record of first virginia common stock for any period as of any date subsequent to the effective date of the merger shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding certificates in respect thereof. after the effective date of the merger, there shall be no further registry transfer on the records of james river of shares of james river common stock. if a certificate representing such shares is presented to first virginia, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for a certificate representing shares of first virginia common stock as herein provided. upon surrender of certificates of james river common stock in exchange for first virginia common stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates of first virginia common stock issued in exchange therefor (i) the amount of dividends theretofore paid with

laws and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends with a record date after the effective date of the merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. no interest shall be payable with respect to such dividends upon surrender of outstanding certificates. subject to the immediately preceding two sentences, whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by first virginia on first virginia common stock, the record date for which is on or after the effective date of the merger, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of first virginia common stock issuable pursuant to the merger as provided above, whether or not certificates for those shares of first virginia common stock have then been issued as

river common stock under the james river option divided by the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest cent). 3.3 dissenting james river shares. notwithstanding anything in this plan of merger to the contrary, shares of james river common stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger and which are held by a stockholder who exercised in accordance

holder shall fail to perfect his right to dissent or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right as the case may be. if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively

chief financial officer executive officer exhibit b to: principal officers and directors of james river bankshares corporation re: restrictions on resale of first virginia common stock the federal securities laws impose certain limitations on the resale of securities of publicly owned companies acquired by principal officers and directors in merger-type transactions. we are required to note these restrictions in the proxy statement and to receive your acknowledgment and agreement to these restrictions. as to the acquisition of james river bankshares, inc. ("james river") by first virginia, these restrictions, in summary, are as follows: for a period of one year from the date of the acquisition, any principal officer or director of james river may not resell, in any three-month period, more than approximately 420,000 shares of first virginia common stock acquired pursuant to the merger. in addition, such securities must be sold in brokers' transactions or in a transaction with a market maker. a broker's transaction is defined as a transaction in which a broker (i) does no more than execute the order to sell the security, receiving no more than the customary broker's commission and (ii) neither solicits nor arranges for the solicitation of orders to buy the security in anticipation of or in connection with the transaction. a more detailed description of these restrictions is as follows: although the issuance of securities of first virginia banks, inc. in the proposed merger will be registered under the securities act and will be issued in compliance with any applicable state laws relating to securities, any public reoffering or sale of such securities by any person who is an "affiliate" of james river at the time the agreement is submitted to a vote of james river stockholders and who thus could be deemed an "underwriter" will, under current law, require either (i) the further registration under the securities act of the securities of first virginia to be sold or (ii) compliance with rule 145 under the securities act (as described below) or (iii) the availability of another exemption from such registration. an "affiliate" is defined as a "controlling person", which could mean, generally, a stockholder owning 10% or more of james river's stock or a director or principal officer of james river. compliance with rule 145 requires compliance with certain of the provisions of rule 144 under the securities act. under such provisions, "affiliates" are only able to sell, in any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the securities of the class outstanding as shown by first virginia's most recent report or statement, (ii) the average weekly reported volume of trading in those securities on all national securities exchanges and reported through the national quotation system of a registered securities association (i.e., nasdaq), or (iii) to the extent such figures are available, the average weekly volume of trading in the securities reported through the consolidated transaction reporting system mandated by rule 17a-15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 for the same four-week period. in addition, if an "affiliate" acts in concert with another person for the purpose of any such sales, the sales of all persons acting in concert would be limited in the aggregate to such maximum number of securities in any three-month period. two additional requirements of rule 144 which must be satisfied in complying with rule 145 are that (1) first virginia must have been current for a period of twelve months prior to the sale in the filing of all reports required by the securities and exchange commission (a condition which first virginia presently fulfills and which it will endeavor to fulfill in the future), and (2) first virginia securities must be sold in brokers' transactions or in a transaction directly with a market maker in the first virginia security involved. a broker's transaction is defined as a transaction in which a broker (i) does no more than execute the order to sell the security, receiving no more than the customary broker's commission and (ii) neither solicits nor arranges for the solicitation of orders to buy the security in anticipation of or in connection with the transaction. if you have any questions about these restrictions either at present or in the future, please feel free to contact me. please acknowledge your receipt of and agreement to these restrictions by signing a copy of this letter and returning it to me. very truly yours, christopher m. cole vice president and assistant general counsel acknowledged and agreed: - ------------------------------ (name and date) exhibit c support agreement this support agreement

(c) the substitute option shall have the same terms as the option, provided that, if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to grantee. the substitute option issuer shall also enter into an agreement with the then-holder or holders of the substitute option in substantially the same form as this agreement, which shall be applicable to the substitute option. (d) the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of the substitute common stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the assigned value (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of shares of the issuer common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable, divided by the average price (as hereinafter defined). the exercise price of the substitute option per share of the substitute common stock (the "substitute purchase price") shall then be equal to the purchase price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of the issuer common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares for which the substitute option is exercisable. (e) the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) "acquiring corporation" shall mean (x) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with issuer (if other than issuer), (y) issuer in a merger in which issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (z) the transferee of all or any substantial part of the issuer's assets (or the assets of its subsidiaries).

(iii) "assigned value" shall mean the highest of (x) the price per share of the issuer common stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made by any person (other than grantee), (y) the price per share of the issuer common stock to be paid by any person (other than the grantee) pursuant to an agreement with issuer, and (z) the highest last sale price per share of issuer common stock quoted on the nasdaq nms (or if issuer common stock is not quoted on the nasdaq nms, the highest bid price per share on any day as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by grantee) within the six-month period immediately preceding the agreement; provided, that in the event of a sale of less than all of issuer's assets, the assigned value shall be the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by grantee (or by a majority in interest of the grantees if there shall be more than one grantee (a "grantee majority")) and reasonably acceptable to issuer, divided by the number of shares of the issuer common stock outstanding at the time of such sale. in the event that an exchange offer is made for the issuer common stock or an agreement is entered into for a merger or consolidation involving consideration other than cash, the value of the securities or other property issuable or deliverable in exchange for the issuer common stock shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by grantee and reasonably acceptable to issuer (or if applicable, acquiring corporation). (if there shall be more than one grantee, any such selection shall be made by a grantee majority.) (iv) "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the substitute common stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the last sale price of the shares of the substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by issuer, the person merging into issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such merger person, as grantee may elect. (f) in no event pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs shall the substitute option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of the substitute common stock outstanding prior to exercise of the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the aggregate of the shares of substitute common stock but for this clause (f), the substitute option issuer shall make a cash payment to grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (f) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (f). this difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by grantee (or a grantee majority) and reasonably acceptable to the acquiring corporation. (g) issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (b) of this section 7 unless the acquiring corporation and any person that controls the acquiring corporation assume in writing all the obligations of issuer hereunder and take all other actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of this section 7 are given full force and effect (including, without limitation, any action that may be necessary so that the shares of substitute common stock are in no way distinguishable from or have lesser economic value than other shares of common stock issued by the substitute option issuer). (h) the provisions of sections 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall apply, with appropriate adjustments, to any securities for which the option becomes exercisable pursuant to this section 7 and, as applicable, references in such sections to "issuer," "option," "purchase price" and "issuer common stock" shall be deemed to be references to "substitute option issuer," "substitute option," "substitute purchase price" and "substitute common stock," respectively. 8. repurchase at the option of holder.

(b) if holder exercises its rights under this section 8, issuer shall, within ten business days after the request date, pay the section 8 repurchase consideration to holder in immediately available funds, and contemporaneously with such payment holder shall surrender to issuer the option and the certificates evidencing the shares of issuer common stock purchased thereunder with respect to which holder then has beneficial ownership, and holder shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial ownership of such shares and that the same are then free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that prior notification to or consent of any governmental or regulatory agency or authority is required in connection with the payment of all or any portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration, holder shall have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to section 8, in whole or in part, or to require that issuer deliver from time to time that portion of the section 8 repurchase consideration that it is not then so prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for consent and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of any such consent). if any governmental or regulatory agency or authority disapproves of any part of issuer's proposed repurchase pursuant to this section 8, issuer shall promptly give notice of such fact to holder. if any governmental or regulatory agency or authority prohibits the repurchase in part but not in whole, then holder shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent permitted by such agency or authority, determine whether the repurchase should apply to the option and/or option shares and to what extent to each, and holder shall thereupon have the right to exercise the option as to the number of option shares for which the option was exercisable at the request date less the sum of the number of shares covered by the option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to section 8(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the option (if any) that has been repurchased. holder shall notify issuer of its determination under the preceding sentence within five business days of receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all of holder's rights under this section 8 shall terminate on the date of termination of this option pursuant to section 3(a). (c) for purposes of this agreement, the "applicable price" means the highest of (i) the highest price per share of issuer common stock paid for any such share by the person or groups described in section 8(d)(i), (ii) the price per share of issuer common stock received by holders of issuer common stock in connection with any merger or other business combination transaction described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii) or 7(b)(iii), or (iii) the highest last sale price per share of issuer common stock quoted on the nasdaq nms (or if issuer common stock is not quoted on the nasdaq nms, the highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal trading market or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as reported by a recognized source chosen by holder) during the 60 business days preceding the request date; provided, however, that in the event of a sale of less than all of issuer's assets, the applicable price shall be the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer (which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes of this agreement), divided by the number of shares of the issuer common stock outstanding at the time of such sale. if the consideration to be offered, paid or received pursuant to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be other than in cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by holder and reasonably acceptable to issuer, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes of this agreement. (d) as used herein, a "repurchase event" shall occur if (i) any person (other than grantee or any subsidiary of grantee shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the 1934 act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then-outstanding shares of issuer common stock, or (ii) any of the transactions described in section 7(b)(i), 7(b)(ii), or 7(iii) shall be consummated. 9. registration rights. (a) issuer shall, subject to the conditions of subparagraph (c) below, if requested by any holder, including grantee and any permitted transferee ("selling holder"), as expeditiously as possible prepare and file a registration statement under the securities laws if necessary in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all shares of issuer common stock or other securities that have been acquired by or are issuable to selling holder upon exercise of the option in accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by holder in such request (it being understood and agreed that any such sale or other disposition shall be effected on a widely distributed basis so that, upon consummation thereof, no purchaser or transferee shall beneficially own more than 5% of the shares of issuer common stock then outstanding), including, without limitation, a "shelf" registration statement under rule 415 under the 1933 act or any successor provision, and issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares or other securities for sale under any applicable state securities laws. each such holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. (b) if issuer at any time after the exercise of the option, but prior to the termination of the option, proposes to register any shares of issuer common stock under the securities laws in connection with an underwritten public offering of such issuer common stock, issuer will promptly give written notice to holder of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of holder given within 30 days after receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of issuer common stock intended to be included in such underwritten public offering by selling holder), issuer will use all reasonable efforts to cause all such shares, the holders of which shall have requested participation in such registration, to be so registered and included in such underwritten public offering; provided, that issuer may elect to not cause any such shares to be so registered (i) if the underwriters in good faith determine that the inclusion of such shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of issuer common stock for the account of issuer, or (ii) in the case of a registration solely to implement a dividend reinvestment or similar plan, an employee benefit plan or a registration filed on form s-4 or any successor form, or a registration filed on a form which does not permit registrations of resales; provided, further, that such election pursuant to clause (i) may only be made once. if some but not all the shares of issuer common stock, with respect to which issuer shall have received requests for registration pursuant to this subparagraph (b), shall be excluded from such registration, issuer shall make appropriate allocation of shares to be registered among selling holders and any other person (other than issuer or any person exercising demand registration rights in connection with such registration) who or which is permitted to register their shares of issuer common stock in connection with such registration pro rata in the proportion that the number of shares requested to be registered by each selling holder bears to the total number of shares requested to be registered by all persons then desiring to have issuer common stock registered for sale (other than issuer or any person exercising demand registration rights in connection with such registration). (c) issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement referred to in subparagraph (a) above to become effective and to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective, provided, that issuer may delay any registration of option shares required pursuant to subparagraph (a) above for a period not exceeding 90 days, provided issuer shall in good faith determine that any such registration would adversely affect an offering or contemplated offering of other securities by issuer. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, issuer shall not be required to register option shares under the securities laws pursuant to subparagraph (a) above: (i) prior to the occurrence of a purchase event and following the termination of the option; (ii) more than twice; (iii) within 90 days after the effective date of a registration referred to in subparagraph (b) above pursuant to which the selling holders concerned were afforded the opportunity to register such shares under the securities laws and such shares were registered as requested; and (iv) unless a request therefor is made to issuer by selling holders holding at least 15% or more of the aggregate number of option shares then outstanding or the right to acquire at least 15% of the option shares. in addition to the foregoing, issuer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement after the expiration of 120 days from the effective date of such registration statement. issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to make any filings, and take all steps, under all applicable state securities laws to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of the option shares so registered in accordance with the intended method of distribution for such shares, provided, that issuer shall not be required to consent to general jurisdiction or qualify to do business in any state where it is not otherwise required to so consent to such jurisdiction or to so qualify to do business. (d) except where applicable state law prohibits such payments, issuer will pay all expenses (including without limitation registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of issuer's counsel), accounting expenses, printing expenses, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions but including liability insurance if issuer so desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to subparagraph (a) or (b) above (including the related offerings and sales by selling holders) and all other qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to subparagraph (a) or (b) above. underwriting discounts and commissions relating to option shares and any other expenses incurred by such selling holders in connection with any such registration (including expenses of selling holders' counsel) shall be borne by such selling holders. (e) in connection with any registration under subparagraph (a) or (b) above issuer hereby agrees to indemnify the selling holders, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the 1933 act, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or any omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and issuer and each officer, director and controlling person of issuer shall be indemnified by such selling holder, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement or omission made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such holder or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use. promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this subparagraph (e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this subparagraph (e), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this subparagraph (e), except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party. in case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party either agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interest of the indemnified party, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action notwithstanding its obligation to bear fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all indemnified parties in any jurisdiction. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnification provided for in this subparagraph (e) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by issuer, all selling holders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities and also the relative fault of issuer, all selling holders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, that in no case shall any selling holder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its option shares included in the offering. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. any obligation by any holder to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other holders. in connection with any registration pursuant to subparagraph (a) or (b) above, issuer and each selling holder (other than grantee) shall enter into an agreement containing the indemnification provisions of this subparagraph (e). (f) issuer shall use its best efforts to comply with all reporting requirements and will do all such other things as may be necessary to permit the expeditious sale at any time of any option shares by holder in accordance with and to the extent permitted by any rule or regulation promulgated by the sec from time to time, including, without limitation, rules 144 and 144a. (g) issuer will pay all stamp taxes in connection with the issuance and the sale of the option shares and in connection with the exercise of the option, and will save holder harmless, without limitation as to time, against any and all liabilities, with respect to all such taxes. 10. quotation; listing. if issuer common stock or any other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the nasdaq nms or any other securities exchange or any automated quotations system maintained by a self-regulatory organization, issuer, upon the request of holder, will promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation or trading or listing the shares of issuer common stock or other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the option on the nasdaq nms or any other securities exchange or any automated quotations system maintained by a self-regulatory organization and will use its best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation or listing as soon as practicable. 11. division of option. this agreement (and the option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of holder, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of issuer for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of issuer common stock purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used herein include any other agreements and related options for which this agreement (and the option granted hereby) may be exchanged. upon receipt by issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of issuer, whether or not the agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. 12. miscellaneous. (a) expenses. except as otherwise provided in section 9, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel. (b) waiver and amendment. any provision of this agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such provision. this agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. (c) entire agreement; no third-party beneficiary; severability. this agreement, together with the merger agreement and the other documents and instruments referred to herein and therein, between grantee and issuer (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (other than any transferees of the option shares or any permitted transferee of this agreement pursuant to section 12(h) and other than as provided in the merger agreement) any rights or remedies hereunder. if any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or a federal or state governmental or regulatory agency or authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. if for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the option does not permit holder to acquire, or does not require issuer to repurchase, the full number of shares of issuer common stock as provided in sections 3 and 8 (as adjusted pursuant to section 7), it is the express intention of issuer to allow holder to acquire or to require issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any amendment or modification hereof. (d) governing law. this agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth of virginia without regard to any applicable conflicts of law rules. (e) descriptive headings. the descriptive headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this agreement. (f) notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) to the parties at the addresses set forth in the merger agreement(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice). (g) counterparts. this agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when both counterparts have been signed, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. (h) assignment. neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder or under the option shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, except that grantee may assign this agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee and grantee may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in part after the occurrence of a purchase event. subject to the preceding sentence, this agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. (i) further assurances. in the event of any exercise of the option by holder, issuer and holder shall execute and deliver all other documents and instruments and take all other action that may be reasonably necessary in order to consummate the transactions provided for by such exercise. (j) specific performance. the parties hereto agree that this agreement may be enforced by either party through specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable relief. both parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such equitable relief and that this provision is without prejudice to any other rights that the parties hereto may have for any failure to perform this agreement. (k) confidentiality agreements. the parties hereto agree that this agreement supersedes any provision of the confidentiality agreements that could be interpreted to preclude the exercise of any rights or the fulfillment of any obligations under this agreement, and that none of the provisions included in the confidentiality agreements will act to preclude holder from exercising the option or exercising any other rights under this agreement or act to preclude issuer from fulfilling any of its obligations under this agreement. in witness whereof, issuer and grantee have caused this stock option agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the day and year first written above. attest: james river bankshares, inc. by: /s/ donald w. fulton, jr. by: /s/ harold u. blythe ------------------------- -------------------------- secretary harold u. blythe president and chief executive officer [corporate seal] attest: first virginia banks, inc. by: /s/ barbara j. chapman by: /s/ barry j. fitzpatrick ------------------------- --------------------------- secretary barry j. fitzpatrick chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer [corporate seal] -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
