(b) change in control. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, if a "change in control" (as defined below) of employer occurs and, during the employment term employee's duties and responsibilities are materially diminished or employee is required to relocate on a full time basis from outside of the geographic area, employee may terminate employment upon 30 days prior written notice to employer and shall be entitled to receive the remaining base salary payments due hereunder for the remainder of the employment term, but in no event less than three months' base salary, and any accrued and unpaid bonus payable in a lump sum within 30 days after the date of termination. for the purposes of this agreement, the term "change in control" of employer shall be defined as and shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is used in section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) directly or indirectly of securities of employer or newco representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of employer's or newco's then outstanding securities (as the case may be), (ii) the board ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors (as defined below) or (iii) a person (as defined in clause (i) above) acquires (or, during the 12-month period ending on the date for the most recent acquisition by such person or group of persons, has acquired) gross assets of employer that have an aggregate market value greater than or equal to over 50% of the fair market value of all of the gross assets of employer immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. for purposes of this agreement, a "continuing director" shall mean a member of the board who either (i) is a member of the board immediately after the effective time of the merger in connection with which this agreement is being executed and delivered or (ii) is nominated or appointed to serve as a director by a majority of continuing directors (including those nominated or appointed pursuant to this clause (ii)) prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. 4. employment as sole occupation employee agrees to devote employee's full business time, attention, skill and effort exclusively to the duties that employer assigns to employee from time to time. employee agrees that employee may not engage in any business activities or render any services of a business, commercial or professional nature, whether or not for compensation, for the benefit of anyone other than employer, unless employer has given its consent in writing in advance; provided, however, that 3 this section shall not preclude employee from (i) engaging in any activities that are solely personal or social in nature or (ii) serving on boards of directors of not-for-profit organizations, and, in all events, that are not a source of secondary income and will not impede the performance of his duties and responsibilities hereunder. 5. non-disclosure of confidential information (a) confidential information. employee acknowledges that employee has been informed by employer that it is employer's policy and the policy of its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates (hereinafter "the companies") to maintain as secret and confidential all information and materials (whether or not stamped or marked "confidential" or bearing some other indicia of confidentiality) relating to (i) the financial condition, operations and business interests, objectives, plans and strategies of the companies, (ii) the systems, know-how, records, products, product plans, product designs, marketing plans, specifications, drawings, product development, services, cost information, inventions, computer programs, technology, marketing and sales strategies, techniques and/or programs, trading and investment strategies and analysis, formulae, methods, methodologies, manuals, customer lists and other trade secrets from time to time acquired, sold, developed, maintained and/or used by the companies, (iii) the nature and terms of the companies' relationships with their customers, licensees, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, stock exchanges, clearing brokers, vendors, consultants, independent contractors, strategic partners, other third parties having dealings or contractual relationships with the companies, attorneys, accountants and employees, and (iv) any proposed public or private offering of the companies (all such information and materials are collectively referred to as "confidential information"). (b) prohibited disclosure. employee agrees that employee will not directly or indirectly at any time (including after the date on which employee's employment terminates) divulge or disclose for any purpose (except as specifically authorized by the companies) to any persons, firms, corporations or other entities (collectively, "third parties"), or use or cause or authorize any third parties to use, any such confidential information, except in the capacity of an employee of employer pursuant to any duties in the course and scope of his employment. "confidential information" does not include information that, at the time of disclosure, is part of the public domain or is generally known in the companies' respective industries without the fault or carelessness of employee, or information which employee can demonstrate was known to or developed by employee prior to the date of employee's commencement of employment with any of the companies without reliance upon or use of confidential information. if employee is required by order of a court or other governmental or self-regulating authority to disclose any confidential information, employee shall immediately notify employer so that employer and/or the other companies may attempt to obtain an appropriate protective order, and, in all events, employee shall only disclose the portion of the confidential information required by such order to be disclosed. (c) employer's materials. employee further agrees that (i) employee will at no time transfer, electronically transmit or remove from the premises of employer any products, prototypes, drawings, designs, specifications, notebooks, software programs or disks, tapes or similar 4 containers of software, e-mail, manuals, data, books, records, materials or documents of any kind or description containing confidential information for any purpose unconnected with the strict performance of employee's duties with employer, and (ii) upon the termination of employee's employment with employer for any reason, employee shall immediately deliver or cause to be delivered to employer any and all such drawings, designs, specifications, notebooks, software programs or disks, tapes or similar containers of software, e-mail, manuals, data, books, records, materials and other documents and materials (and all copies thereof) in employee's possession or under employee's control relating to any confidential information or any other materials which are the property of employer. (d) employee's acknowledgment. employee acknowledges that employee is aware that employee may be subject to severe criminal penalties (including fines and lengthy imprisonment) under both federal and state law, including title 18, sections 1831, et. seq. of the united states code (the economic espionage act of 1996) and section 812.081, florida statutes, as well as substantial civil liability, for (i) stealing, or without employer's permission, taking, misappropriating or concealing, or by fraud or deception procuring, trade secrets, as defined therein, or (ii) without employer's permission, receiving, possessing, altering, destroying, copying, sending, downloading, uploading or conveying trade secrets or other confidential information. employee further acknowledges that any person or entity to whom trade secrets or other confidential information are given by employee may also become subject to severe criminal penalties and civil liability. 6. covenant-not-to-compete (a) covenant-not-to-compete. employee covenants and agrees that, during employee's employment with employer and for a period of two (2) years after the date employee ceases for any reason to be employed by employer, employee shall not, directly or indirectly (as defined below) in any capacity, (i) market, sell, provide or license, or be involved in the marketing, sale, provision or licensing of, any financial market data software products or software-related services (as defined below) to any person or entity who is or was a distributor, retailer, reseller, licensee, subscriber, or customer of employer or any of the other companies at any time during employee's employment with employer and for or to whom employer or any of the other companies has performed such services or sold or licensed such products at any time during the one- year period ending on employee's termination of employment, or (ii) engage or participate in any venture, enterprise, activity or business which involves the sale, licensing, performance or provision of financial market data software products or software-related services, in whole or in part via electronic commerce, telemarketing, telecommunication, cable, the web or the internet, anywhere within the world. "financial market data software products or software-related services" means (a) software products and/or services (including, without limitation, all browser based and other internet related applications) which (1) collect or deliver financial market data (including but not limited to stocks, bonds, options, futures, commodities, other securities and/or fundamental company data), and/or (2) supply financial data to support online investing and trading, including in the form of financial web sites and communities, and internet-delivered streaming or other market data 5 services; and/or (3) are or can be used to make, review or devise investment analyses or strategies, including, without limitation, charting, technical analysis and/or trading or investment strategy design, testing and/or automation and/or (b) securities brokerage services (including, without limitation, in connection with revenue sharing arrangements) and trading and other investment services and services and products ancillary to any such securities brokerage, trading or other investment services; provided, however, that "financial market data software products or software- related services" shall not include the activities specifically set forth on schedule b annexed hereto. employee acknowledges that the businesses of employer and the other companies are international in scope, that, due to the electronic and telephonic nature of employer's and such other companies' businesses and the nature of employer's and such other companies' licensees and customers, one could effectively compete with such business from nearly anywhere in the world, and that, therefore, such geographical area of restriction is reasonable in the circumstances to protect employer's trade secrets and other legitimate business interests. (b) definition of "directly or indirectly." for purposes of section 6(a), "directly or indirectly" means to engage or participate in any venture, enterprise, activity or business which is materially involved (as hereinafter defined) in the marketing, selling, licensing or provision of financial market data software products or software-related services, passively (except for passive investments in publicly-traded companies) or actively, as a sole proprietor or owner, director, officer, shareholder, partner, member, consultant, independent contractor, advisor, participant, employee or agent or in any other manner. for purposes hereof, "materially involved" means that the venture, enterprise, activity or business directly or indirectly or together with any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or partners or through strategic alliances or any specific division or business unit of any such venture, enterprise, activity or business either (1) derives in any year 5% or more of its gross revenue from financial market data software products or software-related services or (2) incurs in any year 5% or more of its expenses (operating and/or capital) in connection with or as a result of financial market data software products or software-related services. (c) payment for covenant-not-to-compete. employer and employee both believe that, due to the specialized nature of employer's and the other companies businesses, it would not be difficult for employee, upon termination of employee's employment, to find gainful employment or have other business pursuits which are not violative of the restrictions set forth above, as there are several industries and lines of business in which employee could work which are dissimilar to, and not competitive with, employer's business. however, employer understands that such restrictions may limit employee's new employment options following a termination of employee's employment with employer. accordingly, if following termination of employment with employer, employee is offered a position which, if accepted, would violate the restrictive covenants set forth above, employer will either (i) consent to employee accepting employment restricted by subsection (a) above, or (ii) not consent, but pay employee additional consideration for employee remaining bound by such restrictions. in order to receive the benefit of these provisions, employee must be and remain in compliance with all provisions of this agreement, and must comply with the following procedures. upon employee's receipt of a written offer of employment which employee desires to accept and which, if accepted, would constitute a violation of subsection 6 (a) above, employee shall promptly notify employer of such offer and provide to employer a copy thereof together with a written statement explaining in reasonable detail employee's job responsibilities at the new employment. within ten (10) days following the date that employer has been given a copy of such offer and written statement, employer will notify employee that either (x) employer consents to employee accepting such new employment (but such consent shall extend only to the job responsibilities described in the written statement and shall not under any circumstances authorize employee to disclose or use any confidential information or to fail to comply with any other provision of this agreement), or (y) employee may not accept the new employment. if employer decides that employee may not accept the new employment, employer shall pay to employee each month an amount equal to 1/24th of employee's annual base salary in effect at the date of termination of employee's employment in excess of any other severance payments being received by employee hereunder upon termination of employment (including, without limitation, pursuant to section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof) less applicable federal and state withholding ("additional monthly payments"). such additional monthly payments will cease at the end of the 24th month following the date of employee's termination of employment, provided that, if employee commences other full-time employment during such 24-month period, such additional monthly payments shall cease upon the commencement of such new employment. employee shall promptly notify employer if employee accepts any such new employment. if employee fails to notify employer of new full-time employment and continues to accept additional monthly payments from employer after commencing new full-time employment, employee shall be obligated to repay to employer all additional monthly payments received from employer pursuant to these provisions. 7. non-solicitation agreement (a) non-solicitation of other personnel. employee acknowledges that employer devotes substantial time, effort and expense to the recruitment, selection, training, development and promotion of talented individuals for positions of significant responsibility with employer. employee further acknowledges that it would be unfair to use employee's familiarity with employer's business and other employees and employer's independent contractors and consultants to participate, directly or indirectly, in any activities designed to cause any of employer's other employees to leave employer's employ or to cause any of employer's independent contractors or consultants to cease performing services for employer. accordingly, employee covenants and agrees that, during employee's employment with employer and for a period of two (2) years after the date employee ceases for any reason to be employed by employer, employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit the services of or recruit, whether on employee's own behalf or on behalf of others, any of the following types of employees, independent contractors or consultants of employer: (i) executives, managers, supervisors or department directors; (ii) technicians, engineers, programmers, designers, developers or information, web or internet services workers (whether employees, independent contractors or consultants); (iii) product, project or task managers or supervisors (whether employees, independent contractors or consultants); (iv) sales, marketing, public or customer relations personnel or consultants; (v) brokers, traders, securities associates or salespersons or other similar types of personnel; (vi) financial or accounting services personnel or 7 consultants; (vii) legal personnel; (viii) customer support personnel or consultants; or (ix) human resources personnel; provided, however, that such provision does not apply to employee's attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other professional advisors; or otherwise persuade or cause, or attempt to persuade or cause, any such employee, independent contractor or consultant to leave employer's employ or cease performing services for employer. (b) damages for breach. employee acknowledges that breach or violation of this covenant would cause substantial damages to employer. employee agrees that, in the event of a breach or violation of this covenant of non-solicitation, employee will be liable to compensate employer for all damages, including, without limitation, consequential damages, not limited to lost profits, expense incurred to replace the employee or business relationship, finder's fees, sign-on bonuses, and compensation, remuneration and/or benefits premiums paid to employees, independent contractors and consultants to secure their services or to replace the lost business relationship(s). the payment of such damages shall not limit, impair or diminish employer's right to seek and obtain (x) any appropriate equitable relief (including but not limited to specific performance, temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunction), (y) other monetary relief, and other relief, at law or in equity, for other causes of action which may have resulted from employee's breach or violation (such as intentional interference with contractual or business relations in the event an employee is solicited by employee for a competitive position and such employee is subject to a covenant-not-to-compete), or (z) monetary and other relief, at law or in equity, from or against persons or entities other than employee. 8. employer's remedies for breach of sections 5, 6 and 7 in addition to the remedies referred to in section 7(b) above, employee agrees that if employee breaches or violates any of employee's covenants or agreements in sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof, employer shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of any and all profits, compensation, commissions, payments and benefits which employee directly or indirectly has realized and realizes as a result of, or in connection with, any such breach or violation. in addition, in the event of a breach or violation or threatened or imminent breach or violation of any provisions of sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof, employer shall be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction or any other appropriate decree of specific performance or equitable relief (without, unless otherwise required by statute, being required to post bond or other security) from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent, prohibit or restrain any such breach or violation or threatened or imminent breach or violation by employee. employer shall be entitled to such injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any ascertainable damages which are suffered. it is understood that resort by employer to such injunctive or other equitable relief shall not be deemed to waive or to limit in any respect any other rights or remedies which employer may have with respect to such breach or violation. 8 9. reasonableness of restrictions (a) reasonableness. employee acknowledges that any breach or violation of sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof will likely cause irreparable injury and damage to employer and that it would be very difficult or impossible to measure all of the damages resulting from any such breach or violation. employee further acknowledges that employee has carefully read and considered the provisions of sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions and remedies set forth in such sections (including the time period, geographical limits and scope of activity restricted) are fair and reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary for the protection of the trade secrets, goodwill and other legitimate business interests of employer. (b) severability. employee understands and intends that each provision and restriction agreed to by employee in sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof be construed as separate and divisible from every other provision and restriction. in the event that any one of the provisions of, or restrictions in, sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, and is not reformed by a court of competent jurisdiction (which a court, in lieu of striking a provision entirely, is urged by the parties to do), the remaining provisions and restrictions shall continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or unenforceable provision or restriction had not been included. in the event that any such provision relating to time period, geographical limits or scope of activity restricted (collectively "limitations") shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum or permissible limitations such court deems reasonable and enforceable, limitations shall be deemed to become and shall then be the maximum limitations which such court deems reasonable and enforceable. (c) survivability. the restrictions, acknowledgments, covenants and agreements of employee set forth in sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of this agreement shall survive any termination of employee's employment (for any or no reason, including expiration of the employment term). 10. ownership of work developed in whole or in part by employee employee covenants and agrees with employer that any and all formulae, devices, patterns, know-how, technology, computer programs, documentation, processes, lists, compilations, literature, inventions, methodologies, techniques and other work product ("work") created or developed in whole or in part by employee (whether alone or in cooperation with others) while an employee of employer, if created or developed in whole or in part (i) on employer's premises, or (ii) during employee's normal working hours, or (iii) with the use of employer's resources, or (iv) based upon employee's access to or knowledge of confidential information, no matter what such work relates to or is about, shall immediately be disclosed by employee to employer and is and shall be solely employer's property. employee further covenants and agrees with employer that any work created or developed in whole or in part by employee (whether alone or in cooperation with others) during the term of employee's employment, even if wholly developed or created off employer's premises, on employee's own time, and without use of employer's resources or confidential information, if related to employer's or any of the other companies' businesses, shall 9 immediately be disclosed by employee to employer and is and shall be solely employer's property. in all such cases, employee agrees that employer is the "person for whom the work was prepared" for the purposes of determining authorship of any copyright in the work, and all of the work shall be deemed "work made for hire" as that term is defined in section 101 of the u.s. copyright act. in addition, all inventions, discoveries, improvements, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, know-how, names, ideas and other proprietary rights and intellectual property rights, whether or not patentable, embodied in, represented by, incorporated in, part of, or relating to any of the work (collectively, "other intellectual property rights") are, and shall be, as between employer and employee, the property of solely employer, and, so there will be no doubt, employee hereby assigns to employer and its successors and assigns all of employee's right, title and interest in and to all other intellectual property rights. if, for any reason, any of the work is determined not to be a "work made for hire" under u.s. law or the law of any other jurisdiction, employee agrees to assign, and does hereby assign, to employer and its successors and assigns all of employee's right, title and interest in and to all copyrights in all of the work. employee shall execute and deliver to employer from time to time upon employer's request such confirmatory assignments, instruments and other documents so as to evidence and confirm full record and beneficial ownership of employer in all such work. employee hereby irrevocably appoints employer as employee's attorney-in-fact for the purpose of signing and delivering such assignments, instruments and other documents, such appointment being coupled with an interest. "work" does not include works or inventions which do not relate to employer's business and are wholly created or developed by employee off employer's premises, on employee's own time and without use of employer's resources or confidential information. 11. non-interference with third-party rights by signing this agreement, and accepting employment or continued employment with employer, employee is representing and warranting to employer that (a) employee is free to accept or continue employment with employer, meaning that employee has no contractual or other commitments which restrict employee from performing employee's employment duties to the fullest extent, and (b) only employer is entitled to the benefit of employee's work and efforts. employer advises employee that employer has no interest in using any other person's patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information ("intellectual property rights") in an unlawful manner, and employee agrees that employee will not, in performing employee's employment duties, make use of any intellectual property rights belonging to another which employer has no right to use. if employee has any doubt about whether employee is misusing intellectual property rights of another, employee shall promptly notify the general counsel of newco ("general counsel"), so that general counsel can ensure that employer may investigate and make the appropriate decision. 12. violation of policies by other employees many, if not most, of employer's employees are or will be required to sign this agreement (or a similar agreement) as a condition of employment or continued employment with employer. if employee becomes aware that any other employee of employer is violating any provisions of this agreement, employee shall promptly report such violation to the general counsel. 10 the information provided, and its source, will be treated confidentially to the extent possible in the circumstances. while employer understands that it is not always easy or pleasant to report wrongdoings of a co-worker, it is critically important that these provisions be observed by employee, as violations of this agreement may cause substantial and irreparable harm to employer's business which would cause all employees of employer to suffer. 13. unfair business practices if, during employee's employment with employer, employee learns or suspects that any unfair or questionable business practice may be occurring, employee shall advise the general counsel promptly. this obligation is intentionally broad and general because it is difficult to anticipate all possible circumstances, and employee should resolve all doubts by reporting the information in question to the general counsel. in particular, if employee receives an offer of any kind (kickbacks, job offers, gifts, offers of money in exchange for information, etc.) from any outside party or another employee of employer, employee shall immediately notify employer and provide all information relating to such offer; provided, however, that this provision shall not require employee to report a bona fide job offer that is not received in exchange for employer's or other companies' information or in connection with any questionable, improper or illegal purpose. no gift, favor, offer, benefit, promise to pay or other thing of value shall be offered, made or authorized by employee for any questionable, improper or illegal purpose, nor shall any bribe or kickback be offered, made or authorized by employee, directly or indirectly, regardless of motive, to or for the benefit of any customer, supplier or other person or entity doing business with employer or any of the other companies, or any employee or agent thereof, or to or for the benefit of any governmental official or employee. 14. law applicable this agreement shall be governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the state of florida. in the event of a dispute, exclusive venue shall be in the state or federal courts for miami-dade county, florida. 15. succession this agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, administrators, legal representatives, successors (by merger or otherwise) and assigns and shall be binding upon the parties and their respective heirs, administrators, legal representatives and successors; however, this agreement may not be assigned by employee. 16. no waiver a waiver of any breach or violation of any term, provision or covenant contained in this agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver of any future or past breach or violation. no oral waiver shall be effective or binding. 11 17. prior or separate agreements this agreement contains the entire agreement between employer and employee as of and after the effective time in employee's capacity as an employee of employer concerning its subject matter, and supersedes as of and after the effective time all prior and contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, including, without limitation, that certain employment agreement made as of february 1, 1999, between employer and employee, except that (i) any preexisting or prior agreements regarding confidentiality, non-solicitation, inventions, work product, proprietary rights, trade secrets and non-competition shall survive to the extent necessary to allow employer maximum protection for its trade secrets, confidential information, goodwill and employee, licensee, independent contractor, consultant, distributor, retailer, reseller, customer and other business relationships and (ii) this agreement and the covenants and agreements set forth herein are separate and independent of any non-competition and non-disclosure agreement that has been executed and delivered by employee concurrently herewith and the covenants and agreements set forth therein and, accordingly, no pursuit or enforcement of any particular right, power, privilege or remedy under this agreement or such non-competition and non-disclosure agreement (as the case may be) at any particular time or from time to time, singly or together with others, or any partial exercise thereof, shall operate as a waiver of, or preclude the exercise or availability of, any right, power, privilege or remedy of employer under this agreement, such non-competition and non-disclosure agreement or any other agreement (as the case may be)(2). 18. attorney's fees in the event either party hereto prevails in any dispute arising from or relating to this agreement, the non-prevailing party will be liable for the prevailing party's reasonable and necessary attorneys' and paralegals' fees and expenses and court costs before and at trial, in any other proceedings and at all appellate levels. 19. effectiveness this agreement shall be effective as of and after the effective time. in the event the merger agreement is terminated before the effective time, this agreement shall be null and void and of no further force and effect.

("online"), a florida corporation, on the one hand, and _____________________ ("shareholder"), on the other hand. a. recitals 1. shareholder is, and will be up to and through the consummation of the mergers (collectively, the "merger") contemplated under the agreement and plan of merger of even date herewith (the "merger agreement"), the owner of certain outstanding shares of either the common stock, $.01 par value, of online ("online common stock") or the common stock, $.01 par value, of omega ("omega common stock"). pursuant to the merger, shareholder will receive either common stock, $.01 par value, of newco ("newco common stock") and cash for fractional shares in exchange for online common stock owned by shareholder or will receive newco common stock in exchange for omega common stock owned by shareholder. 2. upon consummation of the merger at the effective time, (i) omega acquisition corporation, a florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of newco ("omega merger sub"), will be merged with and into omega, and the separate corporate existence of merger sub will cease and omega will continue as the surviving corporation and (ii) onlinetrading acquisition corporation, a florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of newco ("online merger sub" and, together with omega merger sub, the "merger subs") will be merged with and into online, and the separate corporate existence of online merger sub will cease and online will continue as the surviving corporation. 3. as a further result of the consummation of the merger at the effective time, newco will own one hundred percent of the common stock of the surviving corporations (as defined in the merger agreement) and shareholder, together with all the other holders of online common stock and omega common stock, will effectively transfer ownership of the businesses of online and omega to newco. 4. shareholder anticipates that the consummation of the merger will cause shareholder significant financial gain and advantage. shareholder acknowledges and understands that the execution and delivery by shareholder of this agreement is a specific condition precedent to newco, omega, online and merger subs entering into the merger agreement and the obligation of newco, omega, online and merger subs to consummate and effect the merger, and shareholder is executing this agreement in consideration of newco, omega, online and merger subs entering into the merger agreement and consummation by newco, omega, online and merger subs of, and as material inducement to newco, omega, online and merger subs to consummate the merger, resulting in shareholder's receipt of the newco common stock (and cash for fractional shares in the case of a shareholder of online). 5. the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that certain covenants are necessary to protect the value of the goodwill evidenced by the online common stock or omega common stock (as the case may be) relinquished by shareholder in exchange for the newco common stock, as well as the goodwill evidenced by the newco common stock to be received by shareholder in the merger. the parties further agree that, since shareholder's execution and delivery of this agreement is a condition precedent to consummation of the merger, this agreement is therefore beneficial to all of the parties hereto. 6. this agreement covers various subjects, including (i) protection of omega's and online's goodwill, trade secrets and confidential information, (ii) non-solicitation of omega and online's customers, licensees, independent contractors, consultants and employees, and (iii) restrictions on shareholder's ability to compete with omega or online or participate in competitive businesses for a reasonable period of time on and after the effective time of this agreement. each of these subjects is equally important, and shareholder agrees to faithfully and fully observe all covenants and agreements set forth below relating to each subject addressed, without exception. 7. shareholder has been informed and understands, that (a) omega and online have developed and own, and after the merger will continue to collaboratively develop and own, at substantial effort and expense, products, services and valuable trade secrets and other valuable confidential business information, all of which have enhanced and are expected to continue to enhance the value of the newco common stock, omega common stock and online common stock; (b) omega and online have developed and/or will be developing important and substantial relationships with customers, licensees, independent contractors, consultants, strategic partners, vendors and/or other third parties having dealings or contractual relationships with omega and online many of which have been known to or will be made known to shareholder in connection with shareholder's business relationships with omega and online. in light of all of the foregoing, in order to protect omega's and online's legitimate business interests, including their goodwill and trade secrets, and in consideration for, and in order to induce, consummation of the merger, shareholder has agreed to make, for the separate benefit of and enforcement by each of omega, online and newco, the reasonable covenants and agreements set forth below, all of which shall be effective as of and after the effective time. now, therefore, it is agreed as follows: 2 b. covenants and agreements 1. non-disclosure of confidential information (a) confidential information. shareholder acknowledges that shareholder has been informed by omega and online that it is omega's and online's policy to maintain as secret and confidential all information and materials (whether or not stamped or marked "confidential" or bearing some other indicia of confidentiality) relating to (i) the financial conditions, operations and business interests, objectives, plans and strategies of omega and online, (ii) the systems, know-how, records, products, product plans, product designs, marketing plans, specifications, drawings, product development, services, cost information, inventions, computer programs, technology, marketing and sales strategies, techniques and/or programs, trading and investment strategies and analyses, formulae, methods, methodologies, manuals, proprietary software, customer lists and other trade secrets from time to time acquired, sold, developed, maintained and/or used by omega and online, (iii) the nature and terms of omega's and online's relationships with their respective customers, licensees, subscribers, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, stock exchanges, clearing brokers, vendors, consultants, independent contractors, strategic partners, other third parties having dealings or contractual relationships with omega and online, attorneys, accountants and employees, and (iv) any proposed public or private offering of omega and online (all such information and materials are collectively referred to as "confidential information"). (b) prohibited disclosure. shareholder agrees that shareholder will not directly or indirectly at any time (including after the date on which shareholder's employment, if any, with online or omega (as the case may be) terminates and including after shareholder's ownership of any newco common stock or online common stock or omega common stock (as the case may be) terminates) divulge, or disclose for any purpose (except as specifically authorized by both omega and online) to any persons, firms, corporations or other entities (collectively, "third parties"), or use or cause or authorize any third parties to use, any such confidential information, except in the capacity of an employee of omega or online pursuant to any duties in the course and scope of his employment. "confidential information" does not include information that, at the time of disclosure, is part of the public domain or is generally known in omega's and/or online's industry without the fault or carelessness of shareholder. if shareholder is required by order of a court or other governmental or self-regulatory authority to disclose any confidential information, shareholder will immediately notify omega and online so that omega and online may attempt to obtain an appropriate protective order, and, in all events, shareholder will only disclose the portion of the confidential information required by such order to be disclosed. 3 2. covenant-not-to-compete (a) covenant-not-to-compete. shareholder covenants and agrees that for a period of ____(1)____ (__) years after the effective time (the "effective period"), shareholder will not, directly or indirectly (as defined below), in any capacity (i) market, sell, provide or license, or be involved in the marketing, sale, provision or licensing of, any financial market data software products or software-related services (as defined below) to any person or entity who is or was a distributor, retailer, reseller, licensee, subscriber, client or customer of omega or online at any time during the two (2) years preceding the effective time through the conclusion of the effective period, or (ii) market, sell, provide or license, or be involved in the marketing, sale, provision or licensing of, any financial market data software products or software-related services (as defined below), in whole or in part via electronic commerce, telemarketing, telecommunication, cable, the web or the internet, anywhere within the world. "financial market data software products or software- related services" means (a) software products and/or services (including, without limitation, all browser based and other internet related applications) which (1) collect or deliver financial market data (including but not limited to stocks, bonds, options, futures, commodities, other securities and/or fundamental company data), and/or (2) supply financial data to support online investing and trading, including in the form of financial web sites and communities, and internet-delivered streaming or other market data services, and/or (3) are or can be used to make, review or devise investment analyses or strategies, including, without limitation, charting, technical analysis and/or trading or investment strategy design, testing and/or automation and/or (b) securities brokerage services (including, without limitation, in connection with revenue sharing arrangements) and trading and other investment services and services and products ancillary to any such securities brokerage, trading or other investment services; provided, however, that "financial market data software products or software-related services" shall not include the activities specifically set forth on exhibit a annexed hereto. shareholder acknowledges that the businesses of omega and online are international in scope, that, due to the electronic and telephonic nature of omega's and online's businesses and the nature of their licensees, subscribers and customers, one could effectively compete with such businesses from nearly anywhere in the world, and that, therefore, such geographical area of restriction is reasonable in the circumstances to protect omega's and online's respective goodwill, trade secrets and other legitimate business interests. (b) definition of "directly or indirectly." for purposes of section 2(a), "directly or indirectly" means to engage or participate in any venture, enterprise, activity or business which is materially involved (as hereinafter defined) in the marketing, selling, licensing or provision of financial market data software products or software-related services, passively (except for passive - -------- (1) four (4) years for each of andrew a. allen, farshid tafazzoli and benedict s. gambino, william r. cruz and ralph l. cruz and two (2) years for each of e. steven zum tobel and derek j. hernquist. 4 investments in publicly-traded companies) or actively, as a sole proprietor, owner, director, officer, shareholder, partner, member, consultant, independent contractor, advisor, participant, employee or agent, or in any other manner. for purposes hereof, "materially involved" means that the venture, enterprise, activity or business directly or indirectly or together with any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or partners or through strategic alliances or any specific division or business unit of any such venture, enterprise, activity or business either (i) derives in any year 5% or more of its gross revenue from financial market data software products or software-related services or (ii) incurs in any year 5% or more of its expenses (operating and/or capital) in connection with or as a result of financial market data software products or software-related services. 3. non-solicitation of employees and others. (a) non-solicitation of employees and others. shareholder acknowledges that omega and online each devotes substantial time, effort and expense to the recruitment, selection, training, development and promotion of talented individuals for positions of significant responsibility with omega and online. shareholder further acknowledges that it would be unfair to use shareholder's familiarity with omega's and online's businesses, employees, independent contractors and consultants, to participate, directly or indirectly, in any activities designed to cause any of omega's and online's businesses, employees, independent contractors or consultants to cease performing services for either or both of omega and online. accordingly, shareholder covenants and agrees that for the later to occur of (i) one year following the date of termination of the direct and/or indirect beneficial ownership by shareholder of all newco common stock or (ii) two (2) years after the effective time, shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, solicit the services of or recruit, whether on shareholder's own behalf or on behalf of others, any of the following types of employees, independent contractors or consultants of omega and online: (i) executives, managers, supervisors or department directors; (ii) technicians, engineers, programmers, designers, developers or information, web or internet services workers (whether employees, independent contractors or consultants); (iii) product, project or task managers or supervisors (whether employees, independent contractors or consultants); (iv) sales, marketing, public or customer relations personnel or consultants; (v) brokers, traders, securities associates or salespersons or other similar types of personnel; (vi) financial or accounting services personnel or consultants; (vii) legal personnel; (viii) customer support personnel or consultants; or (ix) human resources personnel; provided, however, that such provision does not apply to shareholder's attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other professional advisors. shareholder agrees not to persuade or cause, or attempt to persuade or cause, any such employee, independent contractor or consultant to leave omega's or online's employ or cease performing services for omega or online. (b) damages. shareholder acknowledges that breach or violation of this covenant would cause substantial damages to omega and/or online. shareholder agrees that, in the event of a breach or violation of this covenant of non-solicitation, shareholder will be liable to compensate omega and/or online for all damages, including, without limitation, consequential damages, not limited to lost profits, expenses incurred to replace the employee or business relationship, finder's fees, sign-on bonuses and compensation, remuneration and/or benefits premiums paid to employees, 5 independent contractors and consultants to secure their services to replace the lost relationship(s). the payment of such damages shall not limit, impair or diminish omega's and/or online's right to seek and obtain (x) any appropriate equitable relief (including but not limited to specific performance, temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunction), (y) other monetary and other relief, at law or in equity, for other causes of action which may have resulted from shareholder's breach or violation (such as intentional interference with contractual or business relations in the event an employee is solicited by shareholder for a competitive position and such employee is subject to a covenant-not-to-compete), or (z) monetary and other relief, at law or in equity, from or against persons or entities other than shareholder. 4. remedies for breach of sections 1, 2 and 3 in addition to the remedies referred to in section 3(b), above shareholder agrees that, if shareholder breaches or violates any of shareholder's covenants or agreements in section 1, 2 and 3 hereof, omega and online shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of any and all profits, compensation, commissions, payments and benefits which shareholder directly or indirectly has realized and realizes as a result of, or in connection with, any such violation or breach. in addition, in the event of a breach or violation or threatened or imminent breach or violation of any provisions of section 1, 2 and 3 hereof, omega and online shall be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction or any other appropriate decree of specific performance or equitable relief (without, unless otherwise required by statute, being required to post bond or other security) from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent, prohibit or restrain any such breach or violation or threatened breach or violation by shareholder. omega and online shall be entitled to such injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to any ascertainable damages which are suffered. it is understood that resort by omega and online (or either of them) to such injunctive or other equitable relief shall not be deemed to waive or to limit in any respect any other rights or remedies which omega and online (or either of them) may have with respect to such breach or violation. 5. reasonableness of restrictions (a) reasonableness. shareholder acknowledges that any breach or violation of section 1, 2 or 3 hereof will likely cause irreparable injury and damage to each of omega and online and that it would be very difficult or impossible to measure all of the damages resulting from any such breach or violation. shareholder further acknowledges that shareholder has carefully read and considered the provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 hereof and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions and remedies set forth in such sections (including the time period, geographical limits and scope of activity restricted) are fair and reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary for the protection of the trade secrets, goodwill and other legitimate business interests of each of omega and online. (b) severability. shareholder understands and intends that each provision and restriction agreed to by shareholder in sections 1, 2 and 3 hereof be construed as separate and divisible from every other provision and restriction. in the event that any one of the provisions of, 6 or restrictions in, sections 1, 2 and/or 3 hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, and is not reformed by a court of competent jurisdiction (which a court, in lieu of striking a provision entirely, is urged by the parties to do), the remaining provisions and restrictions shall continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or unenforceable provision or restriction had not been included. in the event that any provision relating to time period, geographical limits or scope of activity restricted (collectively, "limitations") shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum or permissible limitations such court deems reasonable and enforceable, said limitations shall be deemed to become and shall then be the maximum limitations which such court deems reasonable and enforceable. (c) definitions. for purposes of sections 1, 2 and 3 of this agreement, the terms omega and online (a "company") each includes such company (and its successor by merger or otherwise) and any parent corporations of such company (or its successors) and all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such company (or its successor) and its parent corporation. 6. law applicable this agreement shall be governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the state of florida. in the event of a dispute, exclusive venue shall lie in the state or federal courts for miami-dade county, florida. 7. succession this agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, administrators, legal representatives, successors (by merger or otherwise) and assigns and shall be binding upon the parties and their respective heirs, administrators, legal representatives and successors. 8. no waiver a waiver of any breach or violation of any term, provision or covenant contained in this agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver of any future or past breach or violation. no oral waiver shall be effective or binding. 9. separate agreement; cumulative remedies this agreement and the covenants and agreements set forth herein are separate and independent of any employment agreement that has been executed and delivered by shareholder in connection with the merger or any other agreement previously executed by shareholder with either omega or online and the covenants and agreements set forth therein. accordingly, no pursuit or enforcement of any particular right, power, privilege or remedy under this agreement or under such agreement regarding employment (as the case may be) at any particular time or from time to time, singly or together with others, or any partial exercise thereof, shall operate as a waiver of, or 7 preclude the exercise or availability of, any right, power, privilege or remedy of omega or online under this agreement, such employment agreement or any other agreement (as the case may be). 10. attorney's fees in the event any party hereto prevails in any dispute arising from or relating to this agreement, the nonprevailing party will be liable for the prevailing party's reasonable and necessary attorneys' and paralegals' fees and expenses and court costs before and at trial, in any other proceedings and at all appellate levels. 11. termination of merger agreement. in the event that the merger is not consummated and the merger agreement is terminated before the effective time, this agreement shall be null and void and of no further force or effect.

(a) following any exercise of the company option, omega may by written notice (the "registration notice") to company request company to register under the securities act all or any part of the shares of company common stock acquired pursuant to this agreement, including any voting securities issued by way of dividend, distribution or otherwise in respect thereof (the "restricted shares"), beneficially owned by omega (the "registrable securities") in order to permit the sale or other distribution of such registrable securities, including pursuant to a firm commitment underwritten public offering; provided, however, that any such registration notice must relate to a number of shares equal to at least 3% of the outstanding shares of company common stock and that any rights to require registration hereunder shall terminate with respect to any shares that may be sold in any 90-day period pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act. the registration notice shall include a certificate executed by omega and its proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing (the "manager"), stating that manager in good faith believes that, based on the then prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities at a per share price equal to at least 85% of the fair market value of such shares. for purposes of this section 8, the 5 term "fair market value" shall mean the 10 day trading average of the last sale price of a share of company's common stock as reported on the nasdaq smallcap market over the period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the registration notice. (b) company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities; provided, however, that (i) omega shall not be entitled to more than two effective registration statements hereunder and (ii) company will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 60 days after such request in the case of clause (a) below or 90 days in the case of clauses (b) and (c) below) when (a) company is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, based on consultation with counsel to company, such information would have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time; (b) company is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) company determines, in its reasonable good faith judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving company or any of its affiliates. if consummation of the sale of any registrable securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within 180 days after the filing with the sec of the initial registration statement, then such registration shall not be taken into account as an effective registration for purposes of clause (i) above. company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 8 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as omega may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that company shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. (c) the registration rights set forth in this section 8 are subject to the condition that omega shall provide company with such information with respect to omega's registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to omega as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for company, is necessary to enable company to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. (d) if company securities of the same type as the registrable securities are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the new york stock exchange, the nasdaq national market, nasdaq or any other securities exchange or automated quotations system, company, upon the request of omega, shall promptly file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation, trading or listing the shares of registrable securities on such exchange or system and will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation, trading or listing as soon as practicable. 6 (e) a registration effected under this section 8 shall be effected at company's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses of counsel to omega, and company shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner and (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary for transactions of the type contemplated hereby with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering. 9. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. (a) in the event of any change in company common stock by reason of stock dividends, splits, mergers (other than the merger), recapitalizations, combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the company option, and the exercise price per share, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that omega shall receive, upon exercise of the company option, the number and class of shares or other securities or property that omega would have received in respect of the company common stock if the company option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable. (b) in the event that company shall enter in an agreement: (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than in connection with the merger or into omega or any of its subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger; (ii) to permit any person, other than in connection with the merger or omega or one of its subsidiaries, to merge into company and company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then-outstanding shares of company common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of company or any other person or cash or any other property or the outstanding shares of company common stock immediately prior to such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company; or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than omega or any of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, omega shall receive for each company share with respect to which the company option has not been exercised an amount of consideration in the form of and equal to the per share amount of consideration that would be received by the holder of one share of company common stock less the exercise price (and, in the event of an election or similar arrangement with respect to the type of consideration to be received by the holders of company common stock, subject to the foregoing, proper provision shall be made so that the holder of the company option would have the same election or similar rights as would the holder of the number of shares of company common stock for which the company option is then exercisable). 7 10. restrictive legends. each certificate representing shares of company common stock issued to omega hereunder shall, to the extent applicable, include a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable state securities laws and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registrations are available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement, dated as of january 19, 2000, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer. 11. binding effect;
