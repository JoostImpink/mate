and (b) any failure of such party, or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 6.3 access to information from the date hereof until the earlier of the consummation of a subsequent acquisition transaction and the termination of this agreement, the target shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and all their respective officers, directors, employees, independent auditors, accounting advisors, and agents to, afford to the offeror and to the officers, employees, agents and representatives of the offeror such access to all books, records, information, corporate charts, tax documents, filings, memoranda, working papers and files and all other materials in its possession and control, including material contracts and access to the personnel of the target and its subsidiaries on an as reasonably requested basis as well as reasonable access to the properties of the target and its subsidiaries as the offeror may reasonably require at all reasonable times, including for the purpose of facilitating integrated business plans, to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and contracts, and shall furnish the offeror with all data and information as the offeror may reasonably request. - 41 - 6.4 directors&#146;
