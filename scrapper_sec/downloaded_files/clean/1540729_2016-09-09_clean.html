within 10 business days of receipt of the notice and documents described in clause 3(ii), frlp shall notify felp and mec in writing (the &#8220; election &#8221;) that it will, subject to completion of such transaction to effectuate the proposed refinancing, either (i) continue to hold all of the frlp exchangeable notes and receive payment in full in connection with the refinancing on the same terms as all other holders of exchangeable notes, (ii) exchange frlp exchangeable notes in an initial aggregate principal amount not to exceed $180 million plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon (which unpaid interest will be in the form of additional exchangeable notes) (the sum of the initial aggregate principal amount of $180 million plus accrued and unpaid interest is the &#8220; frlp exchangeable notes amount &#8221;) for the securities or other instruments to be issued in the refinancing in an aggregate principal amount (or in the case of instruments not constituting indebtedness, having value (based on the economic terms of such mec investment) in an amount) equal to the frlp exchangeable notes amount on the same terms being issued or borrowed in connection with the refinancing (and, to the extent such refinancing is comprised of multiple series or tranches, on a pro rata basis among such series or tranches), or (iii) any combination of clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above. such election shall be binding and not subject to change, subject to numbered paragraph 4 below. if, after exchanging the entire frlp exchangeable notes amount for an equal aggregate amount of such securities in the refinancing as set forth in the preceding sentence, frlp would not be the lender or holder (as the case may be) of at least 60% of the total amount of any such new tranche or series of securities or other instruments, frlp shall have the option (and shall notify mec or felp, as appropriate, whether or not it chooses to exercise such option in the election) to provide an additional amount in cash to purchase such new tranche or series on the same terms and timing as other investors that would result in frlp holding up to 60% of such new tranche or series. &#160; 4. &#160; felp further covenants and agrees that (regardless of whether or not frlp elects to participate in the refinancing) (i) it shall deliver written notice to each of frlp and mec promptly, but in any event no later than three business days prior to the closing of such refinancing, of any expected change to the terms and the documents reflecting such changes and (ii) upon receipt of such notice of a change in terms and such documents, frlp shall have the right to change any election made pursuant to the first sentence of the previous paragraph within two business days of receipt of such notice. &#160;

if mec proposes to exercise its purchase right (whether alone or in combination with a refinancing), mec shall deliver (or shall cause felp to deliver) notice thereof to frlp and frlp shall deliver notice to mec of its election pursuant to this paragraph in accordance with the notice provisions of numbered paragraphs 3 and 4. &#160; 6. &#160; frlp agrees that (a) it will reasonably cooperate with felp&#8217;s efforts to cause the frlp exchangeable notes to be identified separately from the other exchangeable notes including, in the event of an election, identifying the election made with respect to each of the frlp exchangeable notes (including (i) by their own cusip or sub-cusip number that is separately identifiable from the cusip number assigned to the exchangeable notes not held by frlp at any time the exchangeable notes are held by them through the facilities of the depository trust company and/or (ii) if the exchangeable notes are not held in the facilities of the depositary trust company (a) by the american stock transfer and trust company file number assigned to the frlp exchangeable notes or (b) by such other means as reasonably requested by mec and/or the issuers which may include transferring interests to separate global notes);

gp &#8221;) may express, solely in their capacity as directors of the gp, any opinion they exhibit 99.2-2 &#160; may have on such proposal to the &#8220;independent directors&#8221; of the gp so long as such opinion(s) is shared with mec or one of the directors of the gp appointed by mec within one business day. &#160;
