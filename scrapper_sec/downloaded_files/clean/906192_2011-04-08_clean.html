notwithstanding the foregoing, sections 9 through 18 of this agreement shall survive any termination of this agreement pursuant to clause (b) of this section 8. 9. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

jurisdiction; waiver of jury trial . &#160;(a) each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this agreement or the transactions contemplated by this agreement exclusively in the court of chancery of the state of delaware, or to the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the superior court of the state of delaware (the &#147; chosen courts &#148;), and solely in connection with claims arising under this agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this agreement ( i ) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the chosen courts, ( ii ) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the chosen courts, ( iii ) waives any objection that the chosen courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and ( iv ) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with section 14 of this agreement.

each party certifies and acknowledges that ( i ) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, ( ii ) each party understands and has considered the implication of this waiver, ( iii ) each party makes this waiver voluntarily and ( iv ) each party has been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this section 10. 11. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; specific performance .&#160; each stockholder acknowledges and agrees that ( a ) the covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this agreement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters, ( b ) parent is and will be relying on such covenants in connection with entering into the merger agreement and the rollover commitment letter, the performance of its obligations under the merger agreement and the exchange of shares pursuant to the rollover commitment letter, and ( c ) a violation of any of the terms of such covenants, obligations or agreements will cause parent irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law.&#160; therefore, each stockholder agrees that parent shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain such stockholder from committing any violation of such covenants, obligations or agreements.&#160; these injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies parent may have. 12. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; amendment, waivers, etc .&#160;

assignment; no third party beneficiaries .&#160; this agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by a party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to so assign or otherwise transfer this agreement without such consent shall be void and of no effect;
