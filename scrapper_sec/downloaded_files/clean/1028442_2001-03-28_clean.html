----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 817439102 page 5 of 11 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- by the citrix parties to the company in connection with entering into the merger agreement (as defined and more fully described below), the transaction option agreement or the stockholders agreement (as defined and more fully described below). item 4. purpose of transaction. on march 20, 2001, parent, offeror and the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"). the following is a summary of the merger agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is filed as exhibit 2 hereto and which is specifically incorporated by reference into this item 4. the merger agreement provides for the commencement, within five business days from the public announcement of the merger agreement, by offeror of a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by the merger agreement, the "offer") to purchase all of the company's outstanding shares, for $5.64 per share, net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement. the purpose of the offer is for offeror to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. provided sufficient shares are acquired by offeror, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, offeror will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"), with the company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") as a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. in the event offeror acquires at least 90% of the shares, offeror will commence a short-form merger pursuant to section 253 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware ("dgcl") and section 3-106 of the general corporation law of the state of maryland (the "mgcl") in order to effect the merger. if offeror is unable to acquire at least 90% of the shares, but does acquire at least 50% of the shares and the merger agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, the company will hold a stockholders meeting in accordance with the mgcl in order to effect the merger. at any such stockholders meeting, all of the shares then owned by parent, offeror and any of their subsidiaries will be voted to approve the merger. the purpose of the merger is for offeror to acquire all shares not purchased pursuant to the offer. the merger agreement provides that, promptly after the acceptance for payment, and full payment by parent or any of its subsidiaries of a number of shares which represents a majority of the then outstanding shares of the company after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all options, warrants and securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for shares on or before june 30, 2001 (the "minimum tender condition"), parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number as will give parent, subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"), representation on the board of directors of the company equal to the product of (x) the number of directors on the board of directors of the company (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors) and (y) the percentage that such number of shares so purchased bears to the aggregate number of shares outstanding (such number being the "board percentage"). the schedule 13d - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 817439102 page 6 of 11 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- company has agreed that it shall, upon request by parent, promptly satisfy the board percentage by (i) increasing the size of the board of directors of the company or (ii) using its reasonable efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable parent's designees to be elected to the board of directors of the company and shall cause parent's designees promptly to be so elected. parent currently intends to designate a majority of the directors of the company following consummation of the offer and that such designees shall be certain of the current officers of the parent. in the merger agreement, the company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause the shares to be delisted from the nasdaq national market and de-registered under the exchange act as soon as practicable after the merger becomes effective (the "effective time"). however, offeror intends to cause the company to seek delisting of the shares from the nasdaq national market and to cause the company to apply for termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act as soon after the completion of the offer as the requirements for such delisting and termination are met. if registration of the shares is not terminated prior to the merger, then the shares will cease to be reported on the nasdaq national market and the registration of the shares under the exchange act will be terminated following the completion of the merger. simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement and as an inducement for parent to enter into the merger agreement, parent, offeror and the company also entered into the transaction option agreement (the "transaction option agreement"). the following is a summary of the transaction option agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the terms and conditions of the transaction option agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the transaction option agreement, which is filed as exhibit 3 hereto and which is specifically incorporated by reference into this item 4. under the transaction option agreement, the company has granted parent an irrevocable option (the "company option") to purchase from the company in whole or in part up to a number of shares equal to 19.9% of the number of shares issued and outstanding (before giving effect to the exercise of the company option) at a purchase price of $5.64 per share (the "exercise price"). based on the number of outstanding shares as of march 19, 2001, the number of shares parent has the right to acquire upon full exercise of the company option is approximately 6,520,832 (or such other number of shares as equals 19.9% of the shares immediately prior to the exercise of the company option). the company option is not presently exercisable but may be exercised by offeror from time to time on or after the acceptance for payment of, and full payment by, parent or any of its subsidiaries of the minimum tender condition if, after giving effect to the exercise of the company option and as a result of such exercise, the number of shares then owned by parent and offeror represents at least 90.1% of the shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (as defined in the merger agreement). the company option is intended to increase the likelihood that parent and offeror or will be able to acquire the necessary 90% of the shares that will permit offeror to commence a short-form merger pursuant to the mgcl and the dgcl. schedule 13d - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 817439102 page 7 of 11 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- the transaction option agreement (and the company option) will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the effective time; or (ii) the termination of the merger agreement. in contemplation of entering into the merger agreement, and in order to increase the likelihood that the minimum tender condition will be satisfied and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement consummated, parent and offeror entered into a stockholders agreement, dated march 20, 2001 (the "stockholder agreement") with the company and the stockholders (as defined below). the following is a summary of the stockholders agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the terms and conditions of the stockholders agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the stockholders agreement, which is filed as exhibit 4 hereto and which is specifically incorporated by reference into this item 4. the following stockholders of the company (such stockholders, their affiliates and related trusts, collectively, the "stockholders") are parties to the stockholders agreement: (i) baker communications fund, l.p.
