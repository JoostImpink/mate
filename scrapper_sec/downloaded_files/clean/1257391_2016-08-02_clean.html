in april 2014, wa received a confidential information inquiry from the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") in connection with the purchase of shares in a secondary public offering which occurred in 2012.&#160; wa fully cooperated with the sec and voluntarily reviewed historical trading activity to identify any other potential instances of inadvertant violations of rule 105 of regulation m under the exchange act ("rule 105").&#160;

the sec accepted the offer of settlement, and imposed a cease-and-desist order from future violations of rule 105.&#160; the settlement involved the payment by wa of disgorgement of $788,779, prejudment interest of $48,553.49 and a civil money penalty of $365,592.83 (for a total of $1,202,925.30) to the u.s. treasury. &#160; item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; see item 4 below for a description of the restructuring pursuant to which the shares were acquired.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; item 4. purpose of transaction. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; restructuring &#160; on june 13, 2016, the issuer and certain members of the issuer's management, entered into a comprehensive restructuring support agreement (the "restructuring support agreement") with wa and other holders (the "supporting holders") of approximately 66% of the par value of the issuer's 10.000% senior secured notes due 2019 (the "existing notes"), pursuant to which the supporting holders and the issuer agreed to enter into and implement a proposed comprehensive restructuring of the issuer's balance sheet, including an agreement to fund up to $30 million in new capital (see "new senior loan facility" below). the restructuring support agreement contemplated the following transactions: (i) the supporting holders entry into the new senior loan facility; (ii) the exchange offer (as defined below); (iii) the amending and restating of the intercreditor agreement (as described in item 6); (iv) the issuance of two series of warrants to the existing holders of the issuer' shares; (v) amendment and ratification of new employment agreements with members of senior management of the issuer, the entry into a new management incentive plan, and the issuance of equity to the members of management; and (vi) the amendment of the certain organizational documents (i) &#8211; (vi) together, the "restructuring"). &#160; in addition, the restructuring support agreement provides that upon the closing date (as defined below), the supporting holders have the right to introduce a new slate of directors, and pursuant to the restructuring support agreement, the supporting holders will have the right to designate six of the issuer's new seven member board of directors.&#160; each of wa and one other supporting holder shall retain the right to designate one director nominee for so long as its ownership of outstanding shares is more than 10%.&#160; wa has appointed jake mercer, who also serves as a portfolio manager of wa. &#160; the summary of the restructuring support agreement set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, a copy of which is being filed as exhibit d hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; new senior loan facility &#160; in connection with the restructuring, on june 29, 2016, the issuer, as borrower, and each of the issuer's domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors (the "guarantors"), entered into a new senior secured multi-draw term loan facility (the "new senior loan facility") with the lenders, including wbox 2015-7 ltd., the supporting holders, from time to time party thereto, and delaware trust company, as collateral agent and administrative agent (the "new senior loan facility agent"). in addition to the supporting holders, holders of existing notes that participated in the exchange offer, may participate as lenders in the new senior loan facility based on their proportionate ownership of existing notes.&#160; as part of the consideration for providing the new senior loan facility, the issuer has issued to the lenders, which include the supporting holders, 2,803,302 shares (the "new senior loan shares").&#160; the new senior loan shares were issued upon the consummation of the exchange offer, which occurred on july 27, 2016 (the "closing date").&#160; the new senior loan shares were issued directly to the lenders under the new senior loan facility pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933, as amended, under section 4(a)(2) thereunder. &#160; the summary of the new senior loan facility set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, a copy of which is being filed as exhibit e hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; exchange offer and consent solicitation &#160; in connection with the restructuring, on july 27, 2016, the issuer completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation (the "exchange offer") related to the existing notes. in exchange for $138,128,000 in aggregate principal amount of the existing notes, representing approximately 98.7% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the existing notes, validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the exchange offer, the issuer issued (i) $69,064,000 aggregate principal amount of new 10.000% senior secured second lien notes due 2019 (the "new notes") and (ii) 6,410,502 new shares of the issuer's shares, after giving effect to a 135-to-1 reverse stock split. the issuer delivered cash in lieu of any fractional shares.&#160; in addition, each participating holder received accrued and unpaid interest on its tendered existing notes that were accepted for exchange from their last interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date, which was paid in the form of additional new notes, in an aggregate amount of $7,458,912. the new notes will bear interest at a rate of 10.000% per annum payable in cash, accruing from the settlement date, provided that for each interest payment through and including july 15, 2017, sae may, at its option, pay interest in kind by issuing additional new notes ("pik notes"). interest paid in kind will accrue at a rate per annum of 11.0%, and any pik notes will be fungible with, and will accrue interest at the same rate as, the new notes. concurrently with the exchange offer, the company solicited consents from holders of the existing notes to adopt certain proposed amendments to the indenture under which the existing notes were issued, the existing intercreditor agreement and related collateral and security agreements relating to the existing notes. &#160; the summary of the exchange offer memorandum and consent solicitation dated june 24, 2016 (the "memorandum") set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the memorandum. &#160;

supplemental indenture &#160; in connection with the restructuring, on june 29, 2016, the issuer, the guarantors party thereto (the "existing notes guarantors") and wilmington savings fund society, fsb (successor to u.s. bank national association), as trustee for the existing notes (the "existing trustee"), entered into a first supplemental indenture (the "supplemental indenture") to the indenture governing the existing notes (the "existing indenture"). the supplemental indenture modified the existing indenture to, among other things, permit the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness pursuant to the new senior loan facility and through the issuance of the new notes in the exchange offer. &#160; the supplemental indenture includes additional changes necessary to give effect to the restructuring and directs the existing trustee, in its capacity as noteholder collateral agent for the existing notes, to enter into the amended and restated intercreditor agreement and the amendment to the existing security agreement on behalf of the existing holders.&#160; the material terms of the existing indenture, other than the amendments summarized above, remain substantially as set forth in the existing indenture. &#160; the summary of the supplemental indenture set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the supplemental indenture, a copy of which is being filed as exhibit f hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; amended and restated intercreditor agreement &#160; in connection with the restructuring, on june 29, 2016, wells fargo bank, national association ("wells fargo"), in its capacity as lender and collateral agent under the existing revolving credit facility, wilmington savings fund society, fsb (successor to u.s. bank national association), in its capacity as trustee and collateral agent for the existing notes, and delaware trust company, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent for the new senior loan facility, amended and restated the intercreditor agreement, dated as of november 6, 2014, by and between wells fargo and wilmington savings fund society, fsb (as successor to u.s. bank national association) (the "existing intercreditor agreement" and as amended and restated, the "amended and restated intercreditor agreement"), to govern the relationship of the holders of existing notes (the "existing noteholders"), the holders of new notes (the "new noteholders"), which were issued upon consummation of the exchange offer, and the lenders under the issuer's existing revolving credit facility and new senior loan facility, with respect to the collateral and certain other matters. &#160; the amended and restated intercreditor agreement, among other things, modifies the terms of the existing intercreditor agreement to (i) establish the relative priorities, rights, obligations and remedies with respect to the collateral among the holders of the existing notes, the holders of the new notes, the lenders under the existing revolving credit facility, the lenders under the new senior loan facility, the holders of future debt that are permitted to share the security interests held by the holders of the existing notes, the holders of the new notes, the lenders under the existing revolving credit facility and the lenders under the new senior loan facility, as the case may be, on a pari passu basis and the collateral agents of the foregoing (collectively, the "secured parties"); and (ii) modify the terms of the existing intercreditor agreement to permit the holders of obligations under the new senior loan facility and the new notes to share the security interests held by the existing noteholders and wells fargo as the lender under the existing revolving credit facility as follows: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the obligations under the existing revolving credit facility will be secured by all of the existing collateral on a senior first lien priority basis; &#160; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the obligations under the new senior loan facility will be secured by all of the existing collateral on a junior first lien priority basis; &#160; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the obligations under the new notes will be secured by substantially all of the existing collateral on a second lien priority basis; &#160; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the obligations under the existing notes will be secured by substantially all of the existing collateral on a third lien priority basis; and &#160; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the secured parties will agree that wells fargo bank, national association, as the collateral agent under the existing revolving credit facility, will exercise enforcement actions in respect of the collateral in most cases under the amended and restated intercreditor agreement. &#160; in addition, the amended and restated intercreditor agreement provides that, following a triggering event, as among the secured parties, the senior representative will have the right (subject to a purchase option by the other secured parties) to, or the right to direct any other collateral agent to, adjust or settle insurance policies or claims in the event of any loss thereunder relating to insurance proceeds with respect to collateral, to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting such insurance proceeds and to enforce rights, exercise remedies and discretionary rights and powers with respect to collateral; and similarly, the secured parties will agree that if the company or any guarantor becomes subject to a case under the u.s. bankruptcy code, the secured parties will only be permitted to object to a debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral if the secured parties for which the senior representative is the collateral agent also object. the "senior representative" under the amended and restated intercreditor agreement will be wells fargo bank, national association, as the existing revolving credit facility agent, until the obligations under the existing revolving credit facility have been discharged in full, after which the new senior loan facility agent will be the senior representative; and once the existing revolving credit facility agent and the new senior loan facility agent each cease to be the senior representative and the obligations under each of the existing revolving credit facility and new senior loan facility have been discharged in full, the senior representative will be wilmington savings fund society, fsb, as the new noteholder collateral agent. &#160; the material terms of the amended and restated intercreditor agreement, other than those summarized above, remain substantially as set forth in the existing intercreditor agreement, except that the noteholder collateral agent will no longer have a first-priority security interest in the "noteholder priority collateral" (as such term is defined in the existing intercreditor agreement).&#160; the holders of obligations under the existing revolving credit facility will continue to have lien priority in respect of proceeds of collateral under the amended and restated intercreditor agreement. &#160; the summary of the amended and restated intercreditor agreement set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, a copy of which is being filed as exhibit g hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160;
