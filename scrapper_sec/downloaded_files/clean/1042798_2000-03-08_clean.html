rights and remedies given hereby are in addition to all others however arising, but it is not intended that any right or remedy be exercised in any jurisdiction in which such exercise would be prohibited by law. no action, failure to act or knowledge of the lender shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any power, right or remedy hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or remedy. any waiver or consent respecting any covenant, representation, warranty or other term or provision of this agreement shall be effective only in the specified instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not be deemed, regardless of frequency given, to be a further or continuing waiver or

(a)-(f) are collectively referred to herein as the "loan documents." unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used by not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the credit agreement. this opinion is furnished to you pursuant to section 4.01(f) of the credit agreement. in connection with this opinion letter, we have examined and are familiar with originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the credit agreement executed by each party thereto; (ii) each other loan document executed by each party thereto; (iii) unfiled copy of the financing statement (the "financing statement"), a copy of which is attached hereto, naming the borrower as debtor and the lender as secured party; we understand such financing statement will be

documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. in making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the borrower, the prudential securities credit corporation november 17, 1997 page 3 operating partnership and pg, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof. as to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of pg, the borrower, the reit, the operating partnership and others. whenever in our opinions we indicate that the existence or absence of facts is based on our knowledge or awareness, we are referring to the current actual knowledge of winston & strawn attorneys who have given substantive attention to matters concerning the borrower and pg during the course of our representation of the borrower and pg in connection with the transactions contemplated by the credit agreement. based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the further

standing under the laws of the state of maryland and is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign business trust and is in good standing under the laws of all other jurisdictions where the ownership or leasing of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified does not subject the reit and the subsidiaries (as

the laws of the state of delaware and is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign limited partnership and is in good standing under the laws of all other jurisdictions where the ownership or

"subsidiaries; (ii) the reit has the requisite real estate investment trust power to own or lease its properties and conduct its business described in the registration statement on form s-11

perform its obligations thereunder; (iii) pg has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware. pg is qualified to do

outstanding at any one time in the amount of the commitment; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the loan which shall be outstanding hereunder at any time shall not exceed the available borrowing base. subject to the limitations set forth in this article 2, from the closing date through the maturity date, borrower may reborrow all or any revolver advance which is repaid or prepaid. 2.1.2 procedure for borrowing. each revolver advance shall be made on any business day by lender after borrower has made an irrevocable written or telephonic request to lender for a revolver advance, provided, however, if such request is received by lender after 12:00 p.m., chicago time, on a business day, such request shall be deemed to have been made on the next business day. if such revolver advance is to bear interest at the floating rate, then such revolver advance shall be made on the same business day as the date such request is made or deemed to have been made; if such revolver advance is to bear interest at the fixed rate in accordance with the terms of sections 2.6 and 2.7 below, then such revolver advance shall be made on the third business day following the date such request is made or deemed to have been made. the amount of such revolver advance shall not be less than $100,000, subject to the additional restrictions set forth in section 2.1.1 and section 2.6.1. each request for a revolver advance shall be deemed a certification by borrower that no default or event of default exists or will be created if the requested revolver advance is made. lender

advance, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the loan will exceed the available borrowing base at such time. 2.2 disbursement of loan on closing date. provided (i) no default or event of default shall be in existence on the closing date and (ii) all of the terms and conditions set forth in article iv below shall have been satisfied, on the closing date and subject to the provisions 8

(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be presumptively correct) the fixed rate that shall apply to the subject libor loan and shall promptly give notice thereof to borrower. if on any interest rate determination date lender is unable to obtain the applicable libor rate quotations, lender shall give 11 borrower prompt notice thereof and such requested libor loan shall automatically become a prime loan and shall bear interest at the floating rate. 2.8.2 interest rate unascertainable, inadequate or unfair. if, with respect to any interest period, (i) any change occurs in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation or order (or any interpretation thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, legislation or order) affecting the interbank eurodollar market for such interest period, or (ii) other circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market for such interest period results in the then applicable fixed rates not adequately reflecting the cost to lender of making or funding the libor loans, lender shall give notice thereof to borrower, whereupon until lender has determined that the circumstances giving rise to such inadequacy no longer exist, (a) the right of borrower to elect to have any portion of the loan bear interest based upon the fixed rate shall be suspended for such interest period, and (b) each outstanding libor loan shall bear interest at the floating rate commencing on the last day of the then current interest period therefor, notwithstanding any prior election by borrower to the contrary. 2.9 illegality. in the event that on any date lender shall have reasonably determined that the making or continuation of any libor loan has become unlawful by compliance by lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation or order of any governmental body, then lender shall promptly give notice to borrower of that determination. upon the giving of such notice, borrower's right to request of lender and lender's obligation to make libor loans shall be immediately suspended to the extent specified in such notice, and if any libor loans are then outstanding, each such libor loan shall immediately become a prime loan and shall commence bearing interest at the floating rate. if lender determines at any time following its giving of the aforementioned notice that lender may lawfully make libor loans of the type(s) referred to in such notice, lender shall promptly give notice to borrower of such determination, whereupon borrower's right to request of lender and lender's obligation to make libor loans of such type shall be restored. 2.10 compensation. borrower shall indemnify lender, within five (5) business days following borrower's receipt of the written statement described below, for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred by reason of liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by lender to fund or maintain lender's libor loans to borrower) which lender may sustain (i) if such libor loans are not made when requested due to borrower's actions or inactions, (ii) if any prepayment of any libor loan occurs for any reason on a date which is not the last day of the applicable interest period, or (iii) as a consequence of any required conversion of the interest rate applicable to a libor loan to a floating rate, (such losses, expenses and liabilities being collectively referred to as "break costs"). lender shall promptly deliver to borrower a written statement as to such break costs, which statement shall be rebuttably presumed correct. the maximum amount of any indemnification under this section 2.10 shall not exceed the interest which would have been payable for the

(ii) the pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends and interest paid in respect of the pledged shares and all distributions paid in respect of the pledged units, provided however, that any and all (1) dividends, interest and distributions paid or payable other than in cash in respect of, and instruments and other property received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any pledged collateral, (2) dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any pledged collateral in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution or in connection with a reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in-surplus resulting from a sale or refinancing of any property, and (3) cash paid, payable or otherwise distributed in redemption of, or in exchange for, any pledged collateral, 5 shall be pledged collateral, shall be forthwith delivered to the pledgee to hold as pledged collateral and shall, if received by the pledgor, be received in trust for the benefit of the pledgee, be segregated from the other property or funds of the pledgor, and be forthwith delivered to the pledgee as pledged collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

and third: the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be paid to the pledgor, or its successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. 9. the pledgee appointed attorney-in-fact. the pledgor hereby appoints the pledgee as the pledgor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the pledgor and in the name of the pledgor or otherwise, from time to time after giving notice to pledgee in the pledgee's discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument which the pledgee may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement, including, without limitation, (i) to receive, endorse and collect all instruments made payable to the pledgor representing any dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect of the pledged collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same and (ii) to exercise all rights, including conversion rights, with respect to such pledged collateral. 10. the pledgee may perform. if the pledgor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the pledgee may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the reasonable expenses of the pledgee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the pledgor under section 17. 11. reasonable care. the pledgee shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the pledged collateral in its possession if the pledged collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the pledgee accords its own property, it being understood that the pledgee shall not have any responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any pledged collateral, whether or not the pledgee has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any pledged collateral; provided, however, that upon the pledgor's instruction, the pledgee shall use reasonable efforts to take such action as the pledgor directs the pledgee to take with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders, rights against other parties or other similar matters 7 relative to the pledged collateral, but failure of the pledgee to comply with any such request shall not of itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care, and no failure of the pledgee to preserve or protect any rights with respect to the pledged collateral against prior parties, or to do any act with respect to preservation of the pledged collateral not so requested by the pledgor, shall be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care in the custody or preservation of the pledged collateral. 12. subsequent changes affecting collateral. the pledgor represents to the pledgee that the pledgor has made its own arrangements for keeping informed of changes or potential changes affecting the pledged collateral (including, but not limited to, rights to convert, rights to subscribe, payment of dividends or distributions, reorganization or other exchanges, tender offers and voting rights), and the pledgor agrees that the pledgee shall have no responsibility or liability for informing the pledgor of any such changes or potential changes or for taking any action or omitting to take any action with respect thereto. 13. events of default; remedies upon an event of default. (a) the occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an "event of default" by pledgor under this agreement: (i) there occurs (and is continuing) an event of default under and as defined in the loan agreement; (ii) the pledged shares and the pledged units shall not be exchangeable for shares of prime retail stock or prime group realty stock as set forth in (and subject to the conditions in section 4(e) hereof. (iii) the pledgor fails to perform or observe any material term, covenant (after 5 day written notice) or agreement contained in this agreement on its part to be performed or observed, or any representation or warranty made by the pledgor in this agreement shall be untrue or misleading in any material respect as of the date with respect to which such representation or warranty was made; (iv) a notice of lien, levy or assessment is filed or recorded with respect to all or a substantial part of the pledged collateral, and such lien, levy or assessment is not released, discharged or removed within thirty (30) days from the date it is filed or recorded, except for a lien, levy or assessment which relates to current taxes not yet due and payable or a lien permitted by the loan agreement; and (v) all or a substantial part of the pledged collateral is attached, seized, subjected to a writ or distress warrant, or is levied upon, or comes within the possession of any receiver, trustee, custodian or assignee for the benefit of creditors. 8 (b) if any event of default shall have occurred (and be continuing), the pledgee shall have, in addition to all other rights given by law or by this agreement, the loan agreement or otherwise, all of the rights and remedies with respect to the pledged collateral of a secured party under the code in effect in the state of illinois at that time, and the pledgee may, without notice and at its option, transfer or register the pledged collateral or any part thereof on the books of the issuer thereof into the name of the pledgee or the pledgee's nominee(s), with or without any indication that such pledged collateral is subject to the security interest hereunder. in addition, with respect to any pledged collateral which shall then be in or shall thereafter come into the possession or custody of the pledgee, the pledgee may sell or cause the same to be sold at any broker's board or at public or private sale, in one or more sales or lots, at such price or prices as the pledgee may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery, without assumption of any credit risk. the purchaser of any or all pledged collateral so sold shall thereafter hold the same absolutely, free from any claim, encumbrance or right of any kind whatsoever, except for claims, encumbrances or rights that may arise without the knowledge or consent of the pledgor. unless any of the pledged collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is or becomes of a type sold on a recognized market, the pledgee will give the pledgor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof, or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made. any sale of the pledged collateral conducted in conformity with reasonable commercial practices of banks, insurance companies, commercial finance companies, or other financial institutions disposing of property similar to the pledged collateral shall be deemed to be commercially reasonable. any requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is mailed to the pledgor as provided in section 20 below, at least five (5) days before the time of the sale or disposition. any other requirement of notice, demand or advertisement for sale is, to the extent permitted by law, waived. the pledgee may, in its own name or in the name of a designee or nominee, buy any of the pledged collateral at any public sale and, if permitted by applicable law, at any private sale. all expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of, or incident to, the enforcement of any of the provisions hereof shall be recoverable from the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of pledged collateral. in view of the fact that federal and state securities laws may impose certain restrictions on the method by which a sale of the pledged collateral may be effected after an event of default, the pledgor agrees that upon the occurrence or existence of any event of default, the pledgee may, from time to time, attempt to sell all or any part of the pledged collateral by means of a private placement, restricting the prospective purchasers to those who can make the representations and agreements required of purchasers of securities in private placements. in so doing, the pledgee may solicit offers to buy the pledged collateral, or any part of it, for cash, from a limited number of investors deemed by the pledgee in its judgment, to be responsible parties who might be interested in purchasing the pledged collateral, and if the pledgee solicits such offers from not less than three (3) such investors, then the acceptance by the pledgee of the highest offer obtained therefrom shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable method of disposition of the pledged collateral. 9 in addition, upon the occurrence (and during the continuance) of an event of default, all rights of the pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise and to receive cash dividends and interest payments, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the pledgee as provided in section 6. 14. securities laws. pledgor hereby acknowledges and confirms that pledgee may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the pledged shares and the pledged units by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the securities act and applicable state securities laws and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire any of the pledged shares and pledged units for their own respective accounts for investment and not with the view to the distribution or resale thereof. pledgor further acknowledges and confirms that any such private sale may result in prices or other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner, and the pledgee shall be under no obligation to take any steps in order to permit the pledged shares and pledged units to be sold at a public sale. the pledgee shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the pledged shares and pledged units for any period of time necessary to permit any issuer thereof to register such pledged shares and pledged units for public sale under the securities act or under applicable state securities laws. 15. authority of the pledgee. the pledgee shall have and be entitled to exercise all such powers hereunder as are specifically delegated to the pledgee by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are incidental thereto. the pledgee may execute any of its duties hereunder by or through agents or employees. neither the pledgee, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the pledgee, shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. the pledgor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the pledgee and/or any such director, officer, agent or employee from and against any and all liability incurred by any of them, hereunder or in connection herewith, unless such liability shall be due to its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 16. termination. this agreement shall terminate after the time when all the obligations have been fully paid and performed, at which time the pledgee shall reassign and redeliver (or cause to be reassigned and redelivered) to the pledgor, or to such person or persons as the pledgor shall designate, against receipt, such of the pledged collateral (if any) as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied by the pledgee pursuant to the terms hereof and shall still be held by it hereunder, together with appropriate instruments of reassignment and release. any such reassignment shall be without recourse upon or warranty by the pledgee and at the expense of the pledgor. 17. expenses. the pledgor agrees to reimburse the pledgee promptly after demand for any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, which the pledgee may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the registration of the pledged collateral, (iii) the 10 exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the pledgee hereunder, or (iv) the failure by the pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. 18. security interest absolute. all rights of the pledgee and security interests hereunder, and all obligations of the pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the loan agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the loan agreement; (iii) any exchange, surrender, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the obligations; or (iv) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the pledgor in respect of the obligations or of this agreement. 19. amendments, waivers and consents. no amendment or waiver of any provision of this agreement nor consent to any departure by the pledgor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the pledgee, and then such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. 20. notices. any notice required or desired to be served, given or delivered hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission), and shall be

rights and remedies given hereby are in addition to all others however arising, but it is not intended that any right or remedy be exercised in any jurisdiction in which such exercise would be prohibited by law. no action, failure to act or knowledge of the lender shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any power, right or remedy hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof

agreement shall be effective only in the specified instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not be deemed, regardless of frequency given, to be a further or continuing waiver or
