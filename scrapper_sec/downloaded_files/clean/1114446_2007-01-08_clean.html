or acquisitions, as more fully described in the preferred term sheet. the reporting person will not beneficially own any shares of series a preferred stock. except as described in this item 4 or otherwise described in this statement, the reporting person currently has no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, event or action enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of the form of schedule 13d promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. subject to the terms of the investment agreement and the plan framework support agreement,

conditions in the securities markets generally, general economic and industry conditions, its or his business objectives and other relevant factors, to change its or his plans and intentions at any time, as it or he deems appropriate. in particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing (but subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement), the reporting person (and its
