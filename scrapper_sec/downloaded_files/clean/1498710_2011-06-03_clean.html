(e) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; in the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party&#160; for any reason, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively &#147;losses&#148;) to which the company, the selling stockholders and one or more of the underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and the selling stockholders, on the one hand, and by the underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the securities;

benefits received by the company and the selling stockholders shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, and benefits received by the underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the prospectus. relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information 25 provided by the company or the selling stockholders, on the one hand, or the underwriters, on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.&#160; the company, the selling stockholders and the underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.&#160; notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.&#160; for purposes of this section 8, each person who controls an underwriter within the meaning of either the act or the exchange act and each affiliate, director, officer, employee and agent of an underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such underwriter, and each person who controls the company within the meaning of either the act or the exchange act, each officer of the company who shall have signed the registration statement and each director of the company shall have the same rights to contribution as the company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e). 9. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; default by an underwriter .&#160; if any one or more underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the securities agreed to be purchased by such underwriter or underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this agreement, the remaining underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of securities set forth opposite their names in schedule i hereto bears to the aggregate amount of securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining underwriters) the securities which the defaulting underwriter or underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided , however , that in the event that the aggregate amount of securities which the defaulting underwriter or underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of securities set forth in schedule i hereto, the remaining underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the securities, and if such nondefaulting underwriters do not purchase all the securities, this agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting underwriter, the selling stockholders or the company.&#160;

the purpose of raising proceeds to cover the reasonably estimated u.s. federal or state tax liability incurred by such individual equityholder as a result of the vesting, during the lock-up period, of restricted shares of common stock heretofore granted to such individual equityholder, provided each such disposition shall occur on or about the time of such vesting and shall be of an amount of shares of common stock that raises gross proceeds that, as nearly as reasonably practicable, approximate such tax liability. in addition, each of the individual equityholders shall, during the lock-up period, be entitled to establish a 10b5-1 plan for the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plan, provided that no sale of shares of common stock under such plan shall be allowed until after the expiration of the lock-up period. for purposes of this lock-up agreement, &#147;immediate family&#148; shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin. if the company notifies the individual equityholders in writing that it does not intend to proceed with the initial public offering or for any reason the underwriting

furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use therein or by such holder&#146;s failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. the company will pay to the holder of registrable securities or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided,

by or contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided , however , that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 15b shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the

by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such holder of registrable securities were offered to the public (less underwriters&#146; discounts and commissions) exceeds the total amount of any damages which such holder of registrable securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of a violation by such holder. 30 15c. indemnification procedures . any person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification ( provided that the failure to give prompt notice

with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the

therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by the holder of registrable securities under this section 15 exceed the amount by which the total price at which the registrable securities of such holder of registrable securities were offered to the public (less underwriters&#146; discounts and commissions) exceeds the total amount of any damages which such holder of registrable securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of a violation by such holder. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 15e. other indemnification provisions . the obligations of the company and the holders of registrable securities under this section 15 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this agreement, and otherwise. the indemnification provided for under this agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities. 31 section 16. participation in underwritten registrations no person may participate in any registration hereunder which is

registrable securities will be required to sell more than the number of registrable securities that such holder has requested the company to include in any registration) and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. each person that is participating in any registration hereunder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 12(v) above, such person will forthwith discontinue the disposition of its registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement until such person&#146;s receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by such section 12(v) . in the event the company shall give any such notice, the applicable time period mentioned in section 12(ii) during which a registration statement is to remain effective shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to this section 16 to and including the date when each seller of registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 12(v) . section 17. liquidation value
