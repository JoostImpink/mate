resignation, retirement or other removal of any investor representative and to have the investor representative included as a nominee on the slate of nominees recommended by the board in the company's proxy statement and on its proxy card relating to each annual or other meetings where directors are to be elected by shareholders of the company. the investor&rsquo;s right to designate an investor representative became exercisable beginning on the date of the merger and was exercised by the investor, is subject to certain conditions, and may be terminated under certain circumstances, as set forth in the investment agreement. &#9;b. exchange of expertise and human resources. in furtherance of the alliance contemplated by the investment agreement, the company and the investor intend, from time to time, to engage in the exchange of expertise and human resources so that they may share and develop knowledge and best practices with respect to their respective businesses. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, pursuant to the investment agreement, and subject to the terms therein, the investor is entitled to (i) assign or second to the company one management level representative from the investor to work at the company&rsquo;s headquarters on a full-time basis in a management level position and (ii) assign or second to the company two junior level representatives from the investor to work as analysts (or an equivalent junior-level position) in the company&rsquo;s investment groups to gain experience in the company&rsquo;s research methodologies. &#9;c. standstill restrictions. pursuant to the investment agreement, the investor is subject to certain standstill restrictions and cannot, in each case without the board&rsquo;s consent, among other things, initiate tender or exchange offers for securities of the company or its subsidiaries, seek the nomination or election of any individual as a director of the company (other

extraordinary transaction with respect to the company or its subsidiaries, acquire or obtain any economic interest in securities of the company (other than the acquisition of up to 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares as permitted by the investment agreement) or dispose of any shares of the company ordinary shares in an unsolicited tender offer (other than under certain circumstances as permitted by the investment agreement). the standstill restrictions are suspended if the investor owns less than 3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares and, with certain exceptions, terminated upon change of control of the company. the investor reserves the right to take any of the actions permitted by the exceptions to the standstill provisions of the investment agreement. &#9;d. transfer restrictions. pursuant to the investment agreement, the investor is subject to certain limitations on its ability to transfer its shares of the company ordinary shares and cannot, without the company&rsquo;s consent, transfer its shares of the company ordinary shares within three years of the date of the investment agreement, except that it may transfer its shares of the company ordinary shares to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, effectively binding written or oral administrative guidance from a governmental authority in japan or an order by such a governmental authority, upon an insolvency event with respect to either the company or the investor, upon an &ldquo;event of financial distress&rdquo; (as defined in the investment agreement) with respect to the investor or the company or upon certain other circumstances set forth in the investment agreement. the company is generally entitled to the right of first offer or the right of first refusal, depending on the nature of the proposed transfer, with respect to the investor&rsquo;s proposed transfer of its shares of the company ordinary shares. 4 &#9;e. preemptive rights. under the investment agreement, in the event that the company proposes to issue new shares of the company ordinary shares, for so long as the investor owns at least the applicable percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares, the investor has the right to purchase up to such number of shares of the company ordinary shares that would allow the investor to maintain percentage ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares that is, after giving effect to the issuance of the new securities, no less than the percentage ownership the investor had prior to such issuance. the investor is entitled to exercise its preemptive rights in respect of the company&rsquo;s issuance of new securities to provide equity compensation for employment for its directors, officers or employees only if such issuance would cause the investor&rsquo;s percentage ownership to decrease to less than the applicable percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares. in each case, the investor does not have preemptive rights to the extent that an issuance of the additional shares of the company ordinary shares to the investor would require approval of the stockholders of the company pursuant to rule 312 of the new york stock exchange listed company manual or any successor rule thereof, unless such approval has been obtained. &#9;f. registration rights. under the investment agreement, at any time following the effective time, and without limiting the restrictions on transfers described above, the investor will be entitled to customary registration rights, including the right to require the company to file up to two registration statements to register shares of the company ordinary shares owned by the investor that were acquired by the exercise of any option under the option agreement or pursuant to the investment agreement (the &ldquo; registrable shares &rdquo;), and unlimited prospectus supplements in connection with any take-down from an effective shelf registration statement. in addition, the investor has certain &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; registration rights with respect to the registrable shares to participate in certain securities offerings by the company. &#9;g. termination. the investment agreement may be terminated by either the company or the investor under specified circumstances, including if (a) there is an insolvency event with respect to the other party, (b) necessary to comply with applicable law, effectively binding written or oral administrative guidance from a governmental authority or an order by a governmental authority, (c) during any consecutive five business day period after the effective time, the investor owns less than the applicable percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares, (d) there is a material uncured breach of the investment agreement by the other party, (e) the company terminates the investor&rsquo;s right to designate an investor representative to the board, or (f) at any time following the third anniversary of the date of the merger (following 90-days notice to the other party). in addition, the investment agreement may be terminated by the company if there is a change in japanese generally accepted accounting principles or other applicable accounting principles that would significantly increase the burden to the company in complying with its obligations to furnish certain financial and operating information to the investor, or if the company or any of its affiliates becomes subject to direct regulation by, or sanctions from, any japanese governmental authority that it would not be subject to in the absence of the strategic alliance. the investment agreement may also be terminated by the investor if the company informs the investor that it is unable to comply with its obligations to furnish certain financial and operating information or there is a change in applicable law in japan that requires the investor to receive information that it is not already receiving from the company, such inability to comply or change in applicable law would or would reasonably be expected to result in the investor being in violation of applicable law, and the parties following good faith discussions are unable to agree on appropriate changes to the company&rsquo;s obligations to furnish certain information that would avoid the investor being in violation of applicable law. the investor may also terminate the investment agreement if (a) its percentage ownership has been diluted to less than the applicable percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of the company ordinary shares due to the company&rsquo;s issuance of new securities and the investor was unable to prevent such dilution by exercising its preemptive rights, using commercially reasonable efforts to purchase shares on the open market or exercising its remaining options under the option agreement or (b) the investor or any of its affiliates becomes subject to direct regulation by, or sanctions from, any governmental authority (other than a japanese or u.s.

intends to review its holdings in the company on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the company ordinary shares, subsequent developments affecting the company, the
