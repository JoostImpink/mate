(a) timing of exercise, termination. grantee may exercise the option, in whole or part, at any time and from time to time subsequent to the occurrence of a purchase event (as defined below); provided that the option shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the time immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) 12 months after the first occurrence of a purchase event, (iii) termination of the plan in accordance with the terms thereof prior to the occurrence of a purchase event (other than a termination of the plan by grantee pursuant to section 9.1(c) thereof due to a willful breach by issuer of any representation, warranty or agreement contained therein or by grantee and issuer pursuant to section 9.1(a) thereof if grantee shall at that time have been entitled to terminate the plan pursuant to section 9.1(c) thereof due to a willful breach by issuer of any representation, warranty or agreement contained therein) or (iv) 18 months after the termination of the plan by grantee pursuant to section 9.1(c) thereof due to a willful breach by issuer of any representation, warranty or agreement contained therein or by grantee and issuer pursuant to section 9.1(a) thereof if grantee shall at that time have been entitled to terminate the plan pursuant to section 9.1(c) thereof due to a willful breach by issuer of any representation, warranty or -2- agreement contained therein. the events described in clauses (i) - (iv) in the preceding sentence are hereinafter collectively referred to as an "exercise termination event." notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the option may not be exercised at any time when grantee is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties or agreements contained in the plan such that issuer would be entitled to terminate the plan pursuant to section 9.1(b) thereof. (b) purchase event. the term "purchase event" shall mean the acquisition by any person (other than grantee or any grantee subsidiary or any issuer subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of business (provided that the foregoing exception shall not apply to any person for whom or which such issuer subsidiary is acting in such fiduciary capacity)) of beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, such that, upon the consummation of such acquisition, such person has beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of common stock (c) notice by issuer. issuer shall notify grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any purchase event; provided, however, that the giving of such notice by issuer shall not be a condition to the right of grantee to exercise the option. (d) notice of exercise. in the event that grantee is entitled to and wishes to exercise the option, it shall send to issuer a written notice (the "option notice" and the date of which being hereinafter referred to as the "notice date") specifying (i) the total number of shares of common stock it will purchase pursuant to such exercise, (ii) the aggregate purchase price as provided herein, and (iii) a period of time (that shall not be less than three business days nor more than twenty (20) business days) running from the notice date (the "closing date") and a place at which the closing of such purchase shall take place; provided, that, if prior notification to or approval of the federal reserve board or any other regulatory authority is required in connection with such purchase (each, a "notification" or an "approval," as the case may be), (a) grantee shall promptly file, or cause to be filed, the required notice or application for approval ("notice/application"), (b) grantee shall expeditiously process, or cause to be expeditiously processed, the notice/application, and (c) for the purpose of determining the closing date pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence, the period of time that otherwise would run from the notice date shall instead run from the later of (x) in connection with any notification, the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated, and (y) in connection with any approval, the date on which such approval has been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have expired. for purposes of section 2(a) hereof, any exercise of the option shall be deemed to occur on the notice date relating thereto. (e) payments. at the closing referred to in section 2(e) hereof, grantee shall pay to issuer the aggregate option price for the shares of common stock specified in the option notice in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by issuer; provided, -3- however, that failure or refusal of issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude grantee from exercising the option. (f) at the initial closing referred to in section 2(e) hereof, issuer shall pay grantee an amount in cash equal to three million dollars ($3,000,000) less the difference between (a) the market/offer price (as defined in section 7(a)) of the common stock and (b) $37.00; multiplied by 196,000. (g) delivery of common stock. at such closing, subject to any requisite notification and/or approval having been made or given and being in full force and effect, and only following payment as set forth in section 2(e) hereof, issuer shall deliver to grantee a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of common stock specified in the option notice and, if the option should be exercised in part only, a new option evidencing the rights of grantee thereof to purchase the balance of the shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. grantee shall deliver to issuer a letter at such closing that grantee will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of any option shares in violation of applicable law or the terms of this agreement. (h) common stock certificates. certificates for common stock delivered at a closing hereunder shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend substantially as follows: the transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to resale restrictions arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and the certain provisions of an agreement between financial institutions inc. and bath national corporation ("issuer") dated as of the 2nd day of november, 2000. a copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by issuer of a written request therefor. it is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the securities act in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if grantee shall have delivered to issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. (i) holder of record. upon the giving by grantee to issuer of an option notice and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds on the closing date, subject to any requisite notification and/or approval having been made or given and being in full force and effect, grantee shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the number of shares of common stock specified in the option notice, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books -4- of issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of common stock shall not then actually be delivered to grantee. issuer shall pay all expenses and any and all united states federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this section 2 in the name of grantee. section 3. issuer's covenants. (a) available shares. issuer agrees that it shall at all times until the termination of this agreement have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the option that number of authorized and reserved shares of common stock equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, all of which shares shall, upon issuance pursuant hereto, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights. (b) compliance. issuer agrees that it shall not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by issuer. (c) certain actions, applications and arrangements. issuer shall promptly take all action as may from time to time be required (including (i) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 u.s.c. ss. 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) in the event, under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended (the "b.h.c. act"), or the change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the federa1 reserve board or to any other regulatory authority is necessary before the option may be exercised, cooperating with grantee in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to each such regulatory authority as it may require) in order to permit grantee to exercise the option and issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of common stock pursuant hereto, and to protect the rights of grantee against dilution. section 4. exchange of option. this agreement and the option granted hereby are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of grantee, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of issuer, for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used in this section 4 include any agreements and related options for which this agreement and the option granted hereby may be exchanged. upon receipt by issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, issuer shall execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of issuer, whether or not the agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. -5- section 5. adjustments. the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the option shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) in the event of any change in the common stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like, the type and number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise hereof shall be appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall be made so that, in the event that any additional shares of common stock are to be issued or otherwise to become outstanding as a result of any such change (other than pursuant to an exercise of the option), the number of shares of common stock that remain subject to the option shall be increased so that, after such issuance and together with shares of common stock previously issued pursuant to the exercise of the option (as adjusted on account of any of the foregoing changes in the common stock), it represents the same proportion of the number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding as such proportion before the applicable event described in this section 5(a). (b) whenever the number of option shares purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this section 5, the option price shall be adjusted by multiplying the option price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of option shares purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of option shares purchasable after the adjustment. section 6. registration rights. (a) upon the occurrence of a purchase event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall, at the request of grantee (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of the option (or part thereof) or any holder of the shares of common stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a registration statement under the securities act covering any shares issued and issuable pursuant to the option and shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any shares of common stock issued upon total or partial exercise of the option in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by grantee. issuer shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective. grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations at issuer's expense. grantee shall provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. in connection with any such registration, issuer and grantee shall provide each other with representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily given in connection with such registrations. if requested by grantee in connection with such registration, issuer and grantee shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating themselves in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements. (b) in the event that grantee requests issuer to file a registration statement following the failure to obtain any approval required to exercise the option as described in section 9 hereof, the closing of the sale or other disposition of the common stock or other securities -6- pursuant to such registration statement shall occur substantially simultaneously with the exercise of the option. (c) except where applicable state law prohibits such payments, issuer shall pay all expenses (including without limitation registration fees, qualification fees, blue sky fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel), legal expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the holders whose option shares are being registered, printing expenses and the costs of special audits or "cold comfort" letters, expenses of underwriters, excluding discounts and commissions but including liability insurance if issuer so desires or the underwriters so require, and the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts) in connection with each registration pursuant to this section 6 (including the related offerings and sales by holders of option shares) and all other qualifications, notification or exemptions pursuant to this section 6. (d) in connection with any registration under this section 6, issuer hereby indemnifies grantee, and each officer, director and controlling person of grantee, and each underwriter thereof, including each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement contained in any registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such indemnified party are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to issuer by such indemnified party expressly for use therein, and issuer and each officer, director and controlling person of issuer shall be indemnified by such grantee, or by such underwriter, as the case may be, for all such expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement, that was included by issuer in any such registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular (including any amendments or supplements thereto) in reliance upon, and in conformity with,, information furnished in writing to issuer by such holder or such underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for such use. promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this section 6(d) of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any indemnifying party under this section 6(d), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party under this section 6(d). in case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than -7- reasonable costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party either agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that one or more legal defenses may be available to the indemnifying party that may be contrary to the interests of the indemnified party. no indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel for all indemnified parties or for any settlement entered into without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnification provided for in this section 6(d) is unavailable to a party otherwise entitled to be indemnified in respect of any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such party otherwise entitled to be indemnified, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party to be indemnified as a result of such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of issuer, grantee and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim; provided, however, that in no case shall grantee be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net offering proceeds attributable to its option shares included in the offering. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. any obligation by any grantee to indemnify shall be several and not joint with other holders of option shares. section 7. option repurchase. (a) upon the occurrence of a purchase event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, (i) at the request (the date of such request being the "request date") of grantee, delivered within 30 days of the purchase event (or such later period as may be provided pursuant to section 9 hereof), issuer shall repurchase the option from grantee at a price (the "option repurchase price") equal to the amount by which (a) the market/offer price (as defined below) exceeds (b) the option price:, multiplied by the number of shares for which the option may then be exercised, and (ii) at the request (the date of such request being the "request date") of the owner of option shares from time to time (the "owner"), delivered within 30 days of a purchase event, issuer shall repurchase such number of the option shares from the owner as the owner shall designate at a price (the "option share repurchase price") equal to the market/offer price multiplied by the number of option shares so designated. the term "market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of common stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made after the date hereof and on or prior to the request date, (ii) the price per share of common stock paid or to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with issuer (whether by way of a merger, consolidation or otherwise), (iii)-the highest closing price for shares of common stock within the 90-day period ending on the request date as reported on the nasdaq stock market's national market (as reported in the wall street journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon authoritative source), or (iv) -8- in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm mutually selected by grantee or the owner, as the case may be, on the one hand, and issuer, on the other hand, divided by the number of shares of common stock of issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. in determining the market/offer price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally-recognized independent investment banking firm mutually selected by grantee or owner, as the case may be, on the one hand, and issuer, on the other hand, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. (b) grantee or the owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require issuer to repurchase the option and/or any option shares pursuant to this section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to issuer, at its principal office, a copy of this agreement or certificates for option shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that grantee or the owner, as the case may be, elects to require issuer to repurchase the option and/or the option shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 7. as immediately as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the option and/or certificates representing option shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to grantee the option repurchase price or to the owner the option share repurchase price or the portion thereof that issuer is not then prohibited from so delivering under applicable law and regulation or as a consequence of administrative policy. (c) issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish any repurchase contemplated by this section 7. nonetheless, to the extent that issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from repurchasing the option and/or the option shares in full, issuer shall immediately so notify grantee and/or the owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to grantee and/or the owner, as appropriate, the portion of the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to section 7(b) is prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to grantee and/or the owner, as appropriate, the option repurchase price and the option share repurchase price, respectively, in full, grantee or owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the option or the option shares either in whole or in part whereupon, in the case of a revocation in part, issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to grantee and/or the owner, as appropriate, that portion of the option purchase price or the option share repurchase price that issuer is not prohibited from delivering after taking into account any such revocation, and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (a) to grantee, a new agreement evidencing the right of grantee to purchase that number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock purchasable immediately prior to the delivery of the notice of repurchase less the number of shares of common stock covered by the portion of the option repurchased, or (b) to the owner, a certificate for the number of option shares covered by the revocation. -9- (d) issuer shall not enter into any agreement with any party (other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary) for an acquisition transaction unless the other party thereto assumes all the obligations of issuer pursuant to this section 7 in the event that grantee or owner elects, in its sole discretion, to require such other party to perform such obligations. section 8. substitute option. (a) grant of substitute option. in the event that prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate or merge with any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of common stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and, share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its or any significant issuer subsidiary's assets to any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the option shall, upon the consummation of such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of grantee, of either (x) the acquiring corporation (as defined below), or (y) any person that controls the acquiring corporation (the acquiring corporation and any such controlling person being hereinafter referred to as the "substitute option issuer"). (b) exercise of substitute option. the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of the substitute common stock (as is hereinafter defined) as is equal to the market/offer price (as defined in section 7 hereof), multiplied by the number of shares of the common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable immediately prior to the event described in section 8(a), divided by the average price (as is hereinafter defined). the exercise price of the substitute option per share of the substitute common stock (the "substitute purchase price") shall then be equal to the product of the option price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable immediately prior to the event described in section 8(a) and the denominator is the number of shares for which the substitute option is exercisable. (c) terms of substitute option. the substitute option shall otherwise have the same terms as the option, provided, however, that if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to grantee. (d) substitute option definitions. the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) "acquiring corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with issuer (if other than issuer), (ii) issuer in a merger in which issuer is the continuing or surviving -10- person, and (iii) the transferee of all or any substantial part of issuer's assets (or the assets of any significant issuer subsidiary); (ii) "substitute common stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the substitute option issuer upon exercise of the substitute option; and (iii) "average price" shall mean the average bid and asked price of a share of the substitute common stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the average of the bid and asked price of the shares of the substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale, provided, however, that if such closing price is not ascertainable due to an absence of a public market for the substitute common stock, "average price" shall mean the higher of (i) the price per share of substitute common stock paid or to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with the issuer of the substitute common stock and (ii) the book value per share, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, of the substitute common stock immediately prior to exercise of the substitute option; provided, further, that if issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such merging person, as grantee may elect.
