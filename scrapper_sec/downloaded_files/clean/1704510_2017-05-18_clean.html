and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that the counsel for the indemnifying party who is to conduct the defense of such claim or litigation is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such indemnified party&#146;s expense; provided, however , that the indemnifying party shall bear the expense of such defense of the indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, based upon the written advice of such indemnified party&#146;s counsel, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest; provided, however , that in no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (excluding one local counsel per jurisdiction as necessary) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising

unreasonably withheld or delayed. the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this article vii except and only to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially prejudice the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or any such litigation. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the prior written consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement (i) that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (ii) that includes an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 15 section 7.4 survival . the

indemnification provided for in article vii from the indemnifying party is unavailable to or unenforceable by the indemnified party in respect to any costs, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages,

result of such costs, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified parties, on the other hand, in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the costs, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in article vii , any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. notwithstanding this article viii , an indemnifying stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (i) the total price at which the registrable securities sold by the stockholder exceeds (ii) the amount of any damages which such indemnifying holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission giving rise to such payments, unless such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in respect of which contribution is required resulted from such holder&#146;s intentionally fraudulent conduct. section 8.2 equitable considerations; etc . the company and the stockholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this article viii were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 16 article ix compliance with rule 144 and rule 144a section 9.1 compliance with rule 144 and rule 144a . for so long as the company is subject to the report requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the exchange act, the company shall take such measures and file such information, documents and

written agreement of the company and the purchaser. no waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
