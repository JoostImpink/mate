(a) subject to section 5.03, from and after the split-off date, westar shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the western group, their affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, parent) and their respective officers, directors and employees (each, a "western indemnitee") from and against any and all damages incurred or suffered by any western indemnitee arising out of (i) any and all westar group liabilities other than those relating to taxes, (ii) the breach by any member of the westar group of any obligation under this agreement, and (iii) any western officer loan liability. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, all indemnities relating to taxes or a breach of any obligation under the tax disaffiliation agreement shall be governed solely by the specific terms of the tax disaffiliation agreement. (b) subject to section 5.03, from and after the split-off date, westar shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each western indemnitee and each person, if any, who controls any western indemnitee within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act from and against any and all damages caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the split-off s-4 or rights offering s-1 or any amendment thereof or the information statement, proxy statement or prospectus (in each case as amended or supplemented if westar shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such damages were caused by information provided by any member of the western group specifically for inclusion therein. (c) westar shall indemnify western and parent to the extent the net present value (as defined below) of (x) any gross-up payments, (y) any other incremental payments and benefits, net of any tax benefits to western, parent or any of their affiliates, made, or to be made, by western under the employment agreements to a covered employee (provided, however, that such incremental payments or benefits result from both a termination of employment and a change in control (as defined therein) occurring by reason of transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (excluding any payments attributable to stock options, restricted stock, restricted share units and other equity-based compensation)), and (z) any incremental payments or benefits, net of any tax benefits to western, parent or any of their affiliates, that western employees become entitled to receive under the western executive salary continuation plan solely as a result of a change in control (as defined therein), exceeds (i) if there are gross-up payments (or additional tax is due by western attributable to the loss of deduction under section 280g of the code for such payments), $80,000,000, and (ii) if there are no gross-up payments (and no additional tax is due by western attributable to the loss of deduction under section 280g of the code for such payments), $55,000,000. for purposes of clarification, payments or benefits which were vested prior to the date of the change in control (as defined in the applicable agreement or plan) or which are earned after such date shall not be considered for purposes of this indemnification. for purposes of this provision, net present value determined under subsection (z) above, shall be the amount necessary to purchase single premium annuities from an insurance company with an a.m. best rating of a+ or better to provide the incremental benefits described in said subsection (z), and under subsections (x) and (y) above shall be (i) for any single-sum payment or benefit made within 90 days after the effective date, the actual amount of the payment or benefit, and (ii) for any other payment or benefit, the amount determined using a discount rate of 120% of the applicable federal rate and other reasonable assumptions. such net present value shall initially be calculated (the "employee payments calculation") by western prior to, but as of, the effective time assuming (i) there will be no gross-up payments (unless prior to the effective date western, westar and pnm mutually agree otherwise), and (ii) western will receive a full tax benefit based on western's top effective tax rates for western's tax year in which the effective date occurs. the employee payments calculation shall be delivered to parent on or prior to the cut-off date (as defined in the merger agreement) and shall have sufficient detail to enable parent to ascertain whether or not such calculation was made in conformity with the provisions of this agreement. the notice and dispute provisions of section 3.2(b)(ii) of the merger agreement applicable to the adjustment calculation (as defined therein) shall also apply to the employee payments calculation. if such gross-up payments assumption is finally determined to not have been correct, the indemnification provided above shall be recalculated based on the corrected assumptions. if as a result of such recalculation, westar's indemnification obligation under this section 5.03(c) exceeds any prior amounts paid by westar pursuant to this section 5.03(c), westar shall pay to western such excess amount together with interest thereon at the rate of 120% of the applicable federal rate (in effect on the effective date) for the period beginning on the effective date and ending on the date such payment is made. the payment, if any, under the prior sentence shall be made within 30 days of the date finally determined. (d) each of western and westar shall, and shall cause the other members of their respective groups and their respective affiliates to, use reasonable efforts in good faith (not extending, however, to any obligation to continue to employ any person or to continue any employment benefit or compensation beyond what the parties are otherwise obligated to do pursuant to this agreement, the other split-off documents or the merger agreement) to avoid the imposition of any gross-up payments. section 5.02. western indemnification of westar group. (a) subject to section 5.03, from and after the split-off date, western shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the westar group, their affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees (each, a "westar indemnitee") from and against any and all damages incurred or suffered by any westar indemnitee arising out of (i) any and all western group liabilities other than those relating to taxes and (ii) the breach by any member of the western group of any obligation under this agreement. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, all indemnities relating to taxes or a breach of any obligation under the tax disaffiliation agreement shall be governed solely by the specific terms of the tax disaffiliation agreement). (b) subject to section 5.03, from and after the split-off date, western shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each westar indemnitee and each person, if any, who controls any westar indemnitee within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act from and against any and all damages caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the rights offering s-1, the split-off s-4 or any amendment thereof or the information statement, proxy statement or prospectus (in each case as amended or supplemented if westar shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that those damages are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information that is furnished to westar by western or any of its affiliates (other than any member of the westar group) specifically for use therein. (c) except as provided in section 5.01(c), western shall indemnify each member of the westar group for any and all liabilities related to (i) any gross-up payments, (ii) any other payments made under the employment agreements and (iii) any payments or benefits under the western executive salary continuation plan, including, without limitation any shareholder or other third party claims. section 5.03. insurance and third party obligations; limitation on liability. (a) upon indemnification of an indemnified party (as defined below), the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party against the insurer, to the extent permitted by any applicable policy, or other third party (other than a third party which is a member of the same group of which the indemnified party is a member) with respect to such indemnified amount. it is expressly agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any insured claims or any other claims to which it is obligated or (iii) entitled to any subrogation rights with respect to any obligation hereunder. (b) each party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages and not to cause or worsen any liability which would be a liability of the other party. if an indemnified party shall receive any amount of insurance proceeds or any other amount from a third party in connection with a specific liability giving rise to indemnification hereunder (i) at any time subsequent to the actual receipt of a payment in full indemnification of such liability hereunder, then such indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying party for any such indemnification payment made up to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received or (ii) at any time prior to the receipt of any indemnification payment in respect of such liability hereunder, then the indemnification to be paid under section 5.01 or 5.02 shall be paid net of the amount of any such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received. notwithstanding this section 5.03, (x) in no event shall any indemnified party be required (i) to take any action, or forebear from exercising any right, under the merger agreement or any split-off document or (ii) to take any action with respect to, make any demand under or claim any coverage in connection with, any policy, and (y) nothing herein shall permit any indemnifying party to delay or refrain from making any payment to any indemnified party because of the availability or alleged availability of any policy or insurance proceeds (provided that the foregoing shall not limit the subrogation rights of an indemnifying party under section 5.03(a)). section 5.04. notice and payment of claims. if any western indemnitee or westar indemnitee (the "indemnified party") determines that it is or may be entitled to indemnification by any party (the "indemnifying party") under this article v (other than in connection with any action subject to section 5.05), the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice specifying, to the extent reasonably practicable, the basis for its claim for indemnification and the amount for which the indemnified party reasonably believes it is entitled to be indemnified. within 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party shall pay the indemnified party such amount in cash or other immediately available funds unless the indemnifying party objects in writing to the claim for indemnification or the amount thereof. section 5.05. notice and defense of third-party claims. (a) promptly (and in any event within 10 business days) following the earlier of (i) receipt of notice, whether by service of process or otherwise, of the commencement by a third party of any action against or otherwise involving any indemnified party or (ii) receipt of information from a third party alleging the existence of a claim against an indemnified party, in either case, with respect to which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this agreement (a "third-party claim"), the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party written notice thereof. the failure of the indemnified party to give notice as provided in this section 5.05 shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this agreement, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. (b) within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice from the indemnified party pursuant to section 5.05(a), the indemnifying party may (by giving written notice thereof to the indemnified party) elect at its option to, and shall at the request of the indemnified party, assume the defense of any third-party claim seeking monetary damages at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense unless the indemnifying party objects in writing to such indemnification claim (in which case the indemnified party may not require the indemnifying party to assume the defense and the indemnifying party shall only assume the defense with the consent of the indemnified party). during such 30-calendar day period, unless and until the indemnifying party assumes the defense of such a third-party claim or objects in writing, the indemnified party shall take such action as it deems appropriate, acting in good faith, and at indemnifying party's expense in connection with such third-party claim; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise, or make any offer to settle or compromise, such third-party claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further, that in the event that a third party claim seeks injunctive or other non-monetary relief, the indemnified party shall be entitled to control the defense of the third party claim at the cost and expense of the indemnifying party. (c) if the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a third-party claim, (w) it shall keep the indemnified party timely informed of all significant developments in connection therewith, (x) the defense shall be conducted by counsel retained by the indemnifying party (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party), provided that the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing, and if such third party claim only seeks monetary damages, such participation shall be at the indemnified party's sole cost and expense; and (y) the indemnifying party may settle or compromise the third-party claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party so long as such settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all claims that are the subject of such third-party claim, provided that the indemnifying party may not agree to any such settlement or compromise pursuant to which there is any finding or admission of any violation of law or pursuant to which any remedy or relief (including but not limited to the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of the indemnified party or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof), other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the indemnified party, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). (d) if the indemnifying party has not objected in writing to such indemnification claim, and, if at the end of the 30-calendar day period referred to in section 5.05(b) the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense of such claim, or, if earlier, beginning at such time as the indemnifying party has declined in writing to assume the defense of a third-party claim, (x) the indemnified party will take such steps as it deems appropriate to defend that third-party claim and the defense shall be conducted by counsel retained by the indemnified party, provided that the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense; and (y) the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party on a current basis (and in any event within 30-calendar days after the submission of invoices and bills by an indemnified party) for its expenses of investigation, attorneys' and expert witnesses' fees and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending against such third-party claim and the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party; provided, further, that the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise, or make any offer to settle or compromise, the third-party claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). (e) the indemnifying party shall pay to (or at the direction of) the indemnified party in cash the amount, if any, for which the indemnified party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder within 15 calendar days after such third party claim has been finally determined, in the case of an indemnity claim as to which the indemnifying party has acknowledged liability or, in the case of any indemnity claim as to which the indemnifying party has not acknowledged liability, within 15 calendar days after such indemnifying party's liability, if any, hereunder has been finally determined. (f) notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, western acknowledges and agrees that following the split-off time, westar shall (solely at its own cost and expense) assume and continue the defense of all the westar litigation and that, as long as such settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release of all western indemnitees, westar shall be permitted to settle or compromise such actions without the consent of western or any of its affiliates, provided that westar may not agree to any such settlement or compromise pursuant to which there is any finding or admission of any violation of law or pursuant to which any remedy or relief (including but not limited to the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of the western indemnitees), other than monetary damages for which the westar group shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against any such western indemnitee, without the prior written consent of such western indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, further, that westar shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to defend any western indemnitee and to cause any western indemnitee to be dismissed with prejudice as a party to any pending or future westar litigation and, to the extent any western indemnitee believes, in its reasonable judgment, that westar has failed to diligently pursue such defense or dismissal, the western indemnitee shall be entitled (at its own cost and expense) to independently move for or otherwise pursue such defense or dismissal and to take such related actions as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection therewith. notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may agree to allocate costs and expenses in any other manner pursuant to a settlement to which western consents. westar shall keep western timely informed of all significant developments with respect to the westar litigation to which any western indemnitee is a party. (g) subject to article vii, each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective representatives to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any third-party claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. section 5.06. exclusivity of remedies. the remedies provided for in this article v shall be the sole remedy for damages incurred by an indemnified party under this agreement; provided, if the indemnification provided for in this article v is unavailable to any indemnified party (x) on the grounds that such indemnified party was a former affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) on other public policy grounds, then the indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified party's parent such amount that represents the diminution in value to such parent as a result of the indemnifying party's inability to so indemnify such indemnified party (provided that such amount shall not exceed the amount that would otherwise have been payable by the indemnifying party to such indemnified party in respect of such claim pursuant to this article v). article vi employee matters and transition services section 6.01. employee matters generally. prior to the split-off date, the employees of westar shall be eligible to participate in all applicable employee benefit plans on the same terms as provided by western to its employees. section 6.02. shared services matters generally. with respect to the provision of certain services by either group to the other group after the separation time, the parties hereto agree as set forth herein and in the shared services agreement. article vii access to information section 7.01. provision of corporate records. except as otherwise specifically set forth in this agreement or any ancillary agreement, immediately prior to or as soon as practicable following the split-off date, each group shall provide to the other group all documents, contracts, books, records and data (including but not limited to minute books, stock registers, stock certificates and documents of title) in its possession relating primarily to the other group or its business, assets and affairs (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby); provided that if any such documents, contracts, books, records or data relate to both groups or the business and operations of both groups, each such group shall provide to the other group true and complete copies of such documents, contracts, books, records or data. data stored in electronic form shall be provided in the format in which it existed at the split-off date, except as otherwise specifically set forth in this agreement or any ancillary agreement. section 7.02. access to information. from and after the split-off date and for a reasonable period of time after the split-off date, each group shall, afford promptly to the other group and its accountants, counsel and other designated representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all documents, contracts, books, records, computer data and other data in such group's possession relating to such other group or the business and affairs of such other group (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby) (other than data and information subject to (i) an attorney/client or other privilege that is not specifically subject to the provisions of this article vii or (ii) in the case of access provisions in any joint defense arrangements between a member or members of one group and a member or members of the other group, the terms of the relevant joint defense agreement), insofar as such access is reasonably required by such other group, including, without limitation, for audit, accounting, litigation, regulatory compliance and disclosure and reporting purposes. section 7.03. litigation cooperation. from and after the split-off date: (a) each group shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the other group and its accountants, counsel, and other designated representatives, upon written request, its current and former directors, officers, employees and representatives as witnesses, and shall otherwise cooperate with the other group, to the extent reasonably required in connection with any action or threatened action arising out of either group's business and operations in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved. (b) each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto, upon its receipt or the receipt by any of its affiliates, of a request or requirement (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other similar processes) which relates to the business and operations of the other party (a "request") reasonably regarded as calling for the inspection or production of any documents or other information in its possession, custody or control, as received from any person that is a party in any action, or in the event the person delivering the request is not a party to such action, as received from such person. in addition to complying with the applicable provisions of section 7.06, each party shall assert and maintain, or cause its affiliates to assert and maintain, any applicable claim to privilege, immunity, confidentiality or protection in order to protect such documents and other information from disclosure, and shall seek to condition any disclosure which may be required on such protective terms as may be appropriate. no party may waive, undermine or fail to take any action necessary to preserve an applicable privilege without the prior written consent of the affected party hereto (or any affected affiliate or affiliates of any such party) except, in the opinion of such party's counsel, as required by law. (c) each of western, on its own behalf and on behalf of all members of the western group, and westar, on its own behalf and on behalf of all members of the westar group, hereby waives any conflict which might preclude counsel currently representing western, westar or any of their respective affiliates from representing westar and/or any of its affiliates following the split-off date in connection with the westar litigation existing at the merger effective time. (d) western and westar shall enter into such joint defense agreements, in customary form, as western and westar shall determine are advisable. section 7.04. reimbursement. except to the extent that any member of one group is obligated to indemnify any member of the other group under article v for that cost or expense, each group providing information or witnesses to the other group, or otherwise incurring any expense in connection with cooperating, under sections 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03 shall be entitled to receive from the recipient thereof, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payment for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses that may be incurred in providing such information, witnesses or cooperation. section 7.05. retention of records. from and after the split-off date, except as otherwise required by law or agreed to in writing, each party shall, and shall cause the members of its respective group to, retain all information relating to the other group's business and operations in accordance with the then general practice of such party with respect to information relating to its own business and operations but in any event for not less than seven years from the separation time. notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any such information at any time, provided that, prior to such destruction or disposal, (i) such party shall provide not less than 90 calendar days' prior written notice to the other party, specifying the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of and the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal, and (ii) if the recipient of such notice shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal that any of the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such requesting party, the party proposing the destruction or disposal shall promptly arrange for the delivery of such of the information as was requested at the expense of the requesting party. section 7.06. confidentiality. from and after the split-off date, each party shall hold and shall cause its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, counsel, accountants, agents, consultants, advisors and other authorized representatives ("representatives") to hold in strict confidence all documents and other information (other than any such documents and other information relating solely to the business or affairs of such party) concerning the other party and/or its affiliates ("confidential information") unless such party is compelled to disclose such documents and/or other information by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of its counsel, by other requirements of law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange. confidential information shall not include such documents and/or other information which can be shown to have been (a) in the public domain through no fault of such party, (b) lawfully acquired after the split-off date on a non-confidential basis from other sources or (c) acquired or developed independently by such party without violating this section 7.06 or the confidentiality agreements. notwithstanding the foregoing, such party may disclose such confidential information to its representatives so long as such persons are informed by such party of the confidential nature of such confidential information and are directed by such party to treat such documents and/or other information confidentially. in the event that such party or any of its representatives is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other similar processes) to disclose any of the confidential information, such party will promptly notify the other party so that the other party may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive such party's compliance with this section 7.06. such party shall exercise all commercially reasonable efforts necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the confidential information, including, but not limited to, by cooperating with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the confidential information. if, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the absence of receipt of a waiver of the other party, such party or any of its representatives is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose any of the confidential information, such party or such representative may disclose only that portion of the confidential information which is legally required to be disclosed. such party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this section 7.06 by it and/or its representatives. section 7.07. preservation of privilege. the parties hereto recognize that as a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this agreement or the merger agreement or the ancillary agreements, the parties may have common interests in the defense of certain pending or threatened litigation which may necessitate the exchange between the parties or their counsel of documents or other information that is subject to the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or other legally recognized privileges, protections or immunities from discovery. each party agrees to take in addition to, and not in limitation of, its obligations under section 7.03(b) all commercially reasonable efforts necessary to protect and maintain, and to cause its affiliates to protect and maintain, any applicable claim to privilege, immunity, protection or confidentiality in order to protect such documents and other information from improper disclosure or use. in addition to, and not in limitation of, its obligations under section 7.03(b) and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, none of the parties or their respective affiliates may waive or undermine, or fail to defend in a commercially reasonable manner, any privilege or protection or take or fail to take any other commercially reasonable action (a) that could result in the disclosure of any common-interest or joint-defense materials to any person that is neither a party to this agreement nor an affiliate of any such party or (b) that would have the effect of waiving or undermining such privilege or protection, in either case, without the prior written consent of the affected party and any affected affiliate of such affected party. section

"agreement"), dated as of november 8, 2000, among western resources, inc., a kansas corporation (the "company"), public service company of new mexico, a new mexico corporation ("pnm"), hvolt enterprises, inc., a delaware corporation ("parent"), hvk, inc., a kansas corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("merger sub-1") and hvnm, inc., a new mexico corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("merger sub-2"). recitals whereas, pnm and manzano corporation, a new mexico corporation ("manzano"), have entered into an agreement and plan of share exchange, dated as of april 17, 2000 (the "exchange agreement"), which provides for the mandatory share exchange by the holders of the outstanding common stock of pnm for shares of the common stock of manzano at an exchange ratio of one share of manzano common stock for each share of pnm common stock, whereby pnm will become a wholly owned subsidiary of manzano (the "manzano exchange"); whereas, upon consummation of the exchange, manzano will execute a counterpart hereof as set forth below with the effect set forth herein (the date on which pnm becomes a subsidiary of manzano and manzano executes a counterpart of this agreement being referred to as the "manzano transition date"); whereas, the company, parent, pnm, merger sub-1 and merger sub-2 have agreed to enter into an integrated transaction (the "transaction") pursuant to which, first (x) the company shall deliver to its shareholders its then entire ownership interest in westar industries, inc., a kansas corporation and a subsidiary of the company ("westar", together with the subsidiaries of westar at the time of the split-off, the "westar subsidiaries") (such transaction being referred to as the "split-off"), in exchange for a portion of their shares of the company common stock on the terms and conditions contained herein and in the asset allocation and separation agreement (the "allocation and separation agreement") and the other agreements and term sheets attached thereto (together with the allocation and separation agreement, the "split-off agreements") between the company and westar in the forms attached hereto as exhibit a, and then (y) merger sub-1 will merge with and into the company, whereby the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of parent (the "merger"), and merger sub-2 will merge with and into manzano, whereby manzano and pnm will become wholly owned subsidiaries of parent (the "second merger" and, together with the merger, the "mergers"), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement; whereas, the respective boards of directors of the company, parent, pnm, merger sub-1 and merger sub-2 (i) have determined that the transaction and other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the company, parent, pnm, merger sub-1 and merger sub-2 and their shareholders, respectively, and (ii) have approved this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and whereas, for federal income tax (as defined below) purposes, it is intended that (i) the split-off will be treated as a taxable exchange of the split-off portion (as defined below) of the company common stock for westar common stock, and (ii) the mergers taken together will be treated as a transaction described in section 351

deduction or withholding (except where such deduction or withholding is required by applicable law) from any amount payable to the holders of any shares of manzano common stock or pnm common stock,

arrangements (other than the disaffiliation agreement) to be terminated or no longer in effect with respect to periods following the date of the split-off as between any member of the western group and its affiliates (as those terms are defined in the tax disaffiliation agreement) on the one hand and any member of the westar group and its affiliates (as those terms are defined in the tax disaffiliation agreement) on the other hand. 7.21. tax disaffiliation agreement. at the effective time, parent shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the company under the tax disaffiliation agreement and shall perform all agreements and covenants contained therein. 7.22. shared services agreement. effective upon the closing, the company or such other affiliate of the company as shall be

company will assign the service agreement between the company and protection one, inc., dated april 1, 1999, as amended, to westar. 7.23. interim reporting. no later than the tenth business day of each calendar month through the cut-off date, the company will deliver a statement with respect to the immediately preceding calendar month, of (i) additional cash paid to the company (including information as to the source) during such month, (ii) the application of such additional cash, and (iii) the option selected by westar pursuant to section 3.2(a)(i), such statement also to include a summary of cumulative amounts and any changes in amounts since the date hereof. 7.24. possible exchange. the parties recognize that it would be beneficial for parent if, in lieu of the conversion of the convertible preference shares into the parent convertible shares pursuant to section 3.2(b)(iv) hereof (the "conversion"), the convertible preference shares were instead exchanged (an "exchange") for a principal amount of 7.5% subordinated debt instruments of parent equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of the convertible preference shares which debt instruments ("parent convertible debt") would be (i) convertible into shares of parent common stock at the same conversion ratio as the convertible preference shares, (ii) otherwise substantially in the form of the company's 7-7/8% cumulative quarterly income preferred shares, series a, and (iii) redeemable at the option of parent at par plus accrued interest on the same date on which the parent convertible shares would have been first redeemable at the option of parent. accordingly, if, prior to satisfaction of the conditions contained in article viii hereof, parent proposes that an exchange occur and such exchange would (i) not delay the effective time and (ii) otherwise preserves for westar the economic and tax benefits of ownership of parent convertible shares that otherwise would have been received upon conversion of the convertible preference shares including, but not limited to, the payment to westar of cash in an amount that reasonably compensates westar for the reasonably estimated additional tax payments, if any, resulting from the proposed exchange (taking into account, among other things, the amount (as reasonably projected on the effective date) of (x) westar's additional tax liability from the exchange being taxable and westar subsequently receiving interest instead of dividends until the date that the parent convertible debt could have first been redeemed by parent (the "first redemption date") and (y) the utilization of or loss of any current or future tax benefits of the westar group that could be used to offset tax liability of any member of the westar group in any tax period through the end of the tax period which includes the first redemption date), then the parties shall make a good faith effort to effect an exchange instead of a conversion by means of mutually agreed customary documentation that so preserves such benefits; provided that if the company requisite vote or the parent requisite vote has already been obtained, such exchange does not require any additional approval of the shareholders of the company under the kgcc or other applicable law or the shareholders of pnm or parent under the nmbca or other applicable law. in the event that the parties adopt an exchange, the agreement shall be revised to reflect such transaction as determined necessary by the parties hereto and prior to effecting any such exchange, all material third party and governmental authority declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals necessary for the effectuation of such exchange shall have been obtained and all other conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the transaction and other transactions contemplated hereby, as applied to such exchange, shall have been satisfied or waived. article viii.

(e) injunction. no court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order that is in effect and permanently enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, an "order").
