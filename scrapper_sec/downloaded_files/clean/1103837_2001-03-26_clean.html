the issuer receives from the transaction that is more than what the issuer would have received had the transaction been on an arm's-length basis or on commercially reasonable terms; o any transfer of all or substantially all of odyssey's assets or any business combination involving odyssey where odyssey is not the surviving entity, prior to the second anniversary of the ipo; or 7 o any amendment to the odyssey agreement that would result in none of the issuer or its affiliates having the right to consent to take any of the actions listed in the above bullet points or which would result in

interest in odyssey prior to the second anniversary of the ipo without the consent of visn or nicc. in addition, the issuer agreed not to transfer any of its interests in odyssey after the second anniversary of the ipo unless the transfer is conditioned on the requirement that the transferee assume the issuer's obligations described above. under the terms of the stockholders agreement, the transferee's obligations will generally expire on the later of (1) the fifth anniversary of the ipo, (2) the second anniversary of the transfer or (3) the repayment of visn's preferred interest in

(b) the company shall have the right to postpone (or, if necessary or advisable, withdraw) the filing, or delay the effectiveness, of a registration statement, or fail to keep such registration statement continuously effective or not amend or supplement the registration statement or included prospectus, if the company determines based upon the advice of counsel that it would be advisable to not disclose in the registration statement a planned or proposed financing, acquisition or other corporate transaction or other material information, and the company shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders; provided that no one such postponement shall exceed 90 days in any six-month period and all such postponements shall not exceed 180 days in the aggregate. the company shall advise the demanding stockholder of any such determination as promptly as practicable after such determination.

(c) the rights of each stockholder pursuant to section 4.1 hereof and this section 4.2 are cumulative, and the exercise of rights under one such section shall not exclude the subsequent exercise of rights under the other such section (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise herein). notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the company may abandon and/or withdraw any registration as to which any right under section 4.2 may exist at any time and for any reason without liability hereunder. in such event, the company shall notify each stockholder to the extent that it has delivered a piggy-back notice to such stockholder to participate therein. section 4.3. registration procedures. in connection with a registration statement, the following provisions shall apply: (a) the company shall furnish to each demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, prior to the effective time, a copy of the registration statement as initially filed with the commission, and each amendment thereto and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the prospectus included therein. 16 (b) subject to section 4.1(b) and in respect of a registration statement under section 4.1, the company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly take such action as may be necessary so that (i) each of the registration statement and any amendment thereto and the prospectus forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto (and each report or other document incorporated therein by reference in each case), when it becomes effective, complies in all material respects with the securities act and the exchange act and the rules and regulations, (ii) each of the registration statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) each of the prospectus forming part of the registration statement, and any amendment or supplement to such prospectus, does not at any time during the period during which the company is required to keep a registration statement effective under section 4.1(a) include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) each demanding stockholder or participating stockholder agrees, severally and not jointly, as a consequence of the inclusion of applicable securities in such registration statement, and each underwriter or selling agent shall agree, as a consequence of facilitating such disposition of applicable securities, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the company and each other demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the company or each other demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, within the meaning of either section 20 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the company or each other demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, or such other persons may become subject, under the securities act, the exchange act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was subsequently remedied in an amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus and the company failed to comply with the delivery requirements of the securities act, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of such indemnifying demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, the underwriter or selling agent or its agent, expressly for use therein, and (ii) subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause (ii), reimburse the company and each other demanding stockholder or participating stockholder, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) promptly after receipt by any person entitled to indemnity (an "indemnitee") under section 4.5(a) or (b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action or claim, such indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying person (an "indemnitor") under this section 4.5, notify such indemnitor in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnitor shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnitee except to the extent of any actual prejudice. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnitee, it shall notify an indemnitor of the commencement thereof, such indemnitor shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnitor similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnitee, and, after notice from the indemnitor to such indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnitor shall not be liable to such indemnitee under this section 4.5 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnitee, in connection with the defense thereof. no indemnitor shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnitee, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnitee. notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnitor in any such proceeding and to participate in (but not control, other than as provided in (3) below) the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnitee unless (1) the indemnitor has agreed to 21 pay such fees and expenses; (2) the indemnitor shall have failed after notice to assume the defense of such proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnitee and the indemnitor or any of its affiliates or controlling persons, and a conflict of interest will exist if such counsel represents such indemnitee and the indemnitor (or such affiliate or controlling person) and in the case of (3), the indemnitee shall have the right to control the indemnitee's defense and in each of the cases, if such indemnitee notifies the indemnitor in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnitor; it being understood, however, that the indemnitor shall not, in connection with any one such proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnitees, which firm shall be designated by the indemnitee that had the largest number of shares included in the applicable registration statement. an indemnitor shall not be liable for any settlement of an action effected without its written consent. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 4.5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnitee under section 4.5(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnitor shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnitor and the indemnitee in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnitor and indemnitee shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnitor or by such indemnitee, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.5(d) were determined solely by pro rata allocation (even if each demanding stockholder or participating stockholder or any underwriters or selling agents or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 4.5(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnitee as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the obligations of each demanding stockholder or participating stockholder and any underwriters or selling agents in this section 4.5(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the number of applicable securities registered or underwritten or sold, as the case may be, by them and not joint. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 4.5(d), any demanding stockholder or participating stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such stockholder from the sale of company 22 common stock pursuant to a registration statement exceeds the amount of damages which such stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (e) the obligations of the company under this section 4.5 shall be in addition to any liability which the company may otherwise have to any indemnitee and the obligations of any indemnified person under this section 4.5 shall be in addition to any liability which such indemnified person may otherwise have to the company. the remedies provided in this section 4.5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to an indemnitee at law or in equity. section 4.6. other provisions. (a) the respective indemnities, agreements and other provisions set forth in this article iv or made pursuant to this article iv shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any stockholder, any director, officer or partner of any stockholder, any agent or underwriter, any director, officer or partner of such agent or underwriter, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, and shall survive the registration, offering and sale of the applicable securities of each stockholder. (b) each stockholder shall cooperate with respect to any registration effected under this agreement and shall provide such information, documents, and instruments as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. (c) each stockholder agrees, if so requested by the managing underwriter in any underwritten offering of the company's securities, not to effect any public sale or distribution of registrable securities (other than pursuant to such underwritten offering) during the 30 days prior to and the 90 days after any registration statement for any such underwritten offering of the company's securities (either for its own account or for the benefit of the holders of any securities of the company) has become effective (or such period of time shorter than 90 days that is sufficient and appropriate, in the sole opinion of the managing underwriter, in order to complete the sale and distribution of securities included in such registration). (d) each stockholder agrees to keep confidential the fact that the company has exercised its rights under section 4.1(b), any advice of the company pursuant to section 4.3(c) and any other confidential information provided by the company in connection with this agreement. (e) the company shall use reasonable best efforts to file all reports required to be filed with respect to the company under section 13 or section 15(d) of the exchange act during such time as there are any registrable securities. article v rights relating to investment in odyssey section 5.1. actions of odyssey governance committee. for so long as (a) the company or any of its affiliates shall be entitled to a representative on the odyssey governance committee (as defined in the amended and restated company agreement of odyssey, effective 23 as of november 13, 1998 (the "odyssey agreement")) or is otherwise entitled to consent to the taking of the actions set forth below pursuant to the odyssey agreement and (b) visn and its affiliates which are parties to this agreement either (i) are entitled to nominate or designate a member of the board of directors of the company (the "visn director") or (ii) beneficially own any odyssey preferred interests (as defined in the odyssey agreement), neither the company nor any of its affiliates shall, without the written consent of the visn director or the representative of nicc designated on exhibit c, or otherwise designated by nicc and delivered in writing to the company (the "nicc representative"), vote in favor of (or otherwise consent to), directly or through their representatives: (i) (a) any change in the following provisions of the odyssey agreement: section 5.7 (but solely in the case of section 5.7.2, with respect to the creation or issuance of any interest senior to, or pari passu with, the preferred interest), section 6.6, section 6.7.2, section 6.9, section 8.1 (but only insofar as section 8.1 relates to the preferred interest), section 8.3 (but only insofar as section 8.3 relates to or establishes the priority for the preferred interest), section 10.1.1, section 10.3 (but only insofar as section 10.3 relates to the preferred interest) or section 13.3 or (b) any of the actions described in the following provisions of the odyssey agreement: section 6.2.2.1, section 6.2.2.4 (but solely with respect to the creation or issuance of any interest senior to, or pari passu with, the preferred interest) or clause (b) of section 6.2.2.5 (but solely with respect to the incurrence of debt which restricts payments made in connection with the nicc budget (as defined in the odyssey agreement));

(iv) any merger or other business combination involving odyssey where odyssey is not the surviving entity unless at the time of such merger or business combination (a) the surviving entity assumes the preferred interest on terms no less favorable to visn than those set forth in the odyssey agreement including, but not limited to, section 5.7 (but solely in the case of section 5.7.2, with respect to the creation or issuance of any interest senior to, or pari passu with, the preferred interest), section 8.1 (but only insofar as section 8.1 relates to the preferred interest), section 8.3 (but only insofar as section 8.3 relates or establishes the priority for the preferred interest), section 10.1.1, section 10.3 (but only insofar as section 10.3 relates to the preferred interest) and 24 section 13.3, (b) references to odyssey in sections 5.1(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (viii) of this agreement shall be deemed to refer to such surviving entity and (c) the surviving entity assumes all of the obligations contained in section 6.6, section 6.7.2 and section 6.9 of the odyssey agreement and agrees not to take the actions described in section 6.2.2.1, section 6.2.2.4 (but solely with respect to the creation or issuance of any interest senior to, or pari passu with, the preferred interest) and clause (b) of section 6.2.2.5 (but solely with respect to the incurrence of debt which restricts payments made in connection with the nicc budget) of the odyssey agreement until the later of the fifth anniversary of the ipo or the second anniversary of such merger or business combination, provided section 6.2.2.4 shall only expire when the preferred interest has been redeemed, and provided, further that the obligations of the surviving entity under this clause (c) shall not so expire in the case of a merger or other business combination in which the holders of equity interests in odyssey (not including the preferred interests) immediately before such transaction own at least a majority of the equity interests in such surviving entity (or its parent) (not including the preferred interests) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership prior to such transaction. (v) the dissolution of odyssey, except in connection with a complete liquidation of the business conducted by odyssey because such business is being discontinued; (vi) (a) any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of odyssey's assets to, or any merger or other business combination involving odyssey with, the company or any of its affiliates or (b) any other material transaction (with respect to odyssey) with the company or any of its affiliates that is not on an arm's length basis or on commercially reasonable terms if such transaction results in (1) an excessive or unfair financial benefit to the company or any of its affiliates and (2) an inability of odyssey to satisfy its obligations under section 6.6 of the odyssey agreement or with respect to the preferred interests. in such event the company agrees to apply the amount by which its excessive or unfair financial benefit exceeds the financial benefit that the company would have received if the transaction had been entered into on an arm's length basis or on commercially reasonable terms to satisfy such odyssey obligations; (vii) any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of odyssey's assets, or any merger or other business combination involving odyssey where odyssey is not the surviving entity, in each case prior to the second anniversary of the ipo; or (viii) any amendment or modification to the odyssey agreement, the result of which would be that (a) none of the company or any of its affiliates or their respective representatives would have the right to consent to the taking of the actions listed in subparagraphs (i) though (vii) above, (b) visn would have any increased liability or additional obligations under the odyssey agreement, or (c) there would occur any adverse change to visn's capital account (as defined in the odyssey agreement) with respect to the preferred interests except to reflect the redemption thereof pursuant to section 5.7 of the odyssey agreement. 25 section 5.2. restriction on transfer of the company's interests in odyssey.
