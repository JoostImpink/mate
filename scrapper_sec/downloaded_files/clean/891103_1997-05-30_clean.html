of the election of directors or to execute written consents of stockholders without a meeting with respect to the election of directors, in favor of mr. allen or a designee of mr. allen acceptable to hsn, so long as mr. allen is entitled to representation on hsn's board of directors under the stock exchange agreement. the stockholders agreement will terminate (as will mr. allen's right under the

of hsn is entitled to one (1) vote per share, 4.97% of hsn's total outstanding voting power (based on information supplied by hsn to mr. allen that, as of may 1, 1997, there were outstanding

(b) if hsni and the stockholder cannot agree as to what constitutes customary terms within 10 days of the stockholder's request for registration (whether in a demand registration or a piggyback registration), then such determination shall be made by a law firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to hsni and the stockholder. section 5.03. hsr filings. following the date hereof, the ----------- stockholder and hsni shall, and the stockholder shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the company to, file promptly any forms required under applicable law and take any other action reasonably requested in connection with obtaining the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act. section 5.04. access to information.
