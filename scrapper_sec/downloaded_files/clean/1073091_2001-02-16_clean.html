disposition may be effected without registration or qualification (under the act as then in effect or any federal or state law then in effect) of such warrant shares and indicating whether or not under the act certificates for such shares to be sold or otherwise disposed of require any restrictive legend as to applicable restrictions on transferability in order to ensure compliance with the act; provided, however, that no such opinion of counsel or no action letter shall be necessary for a transfer without consideration by a holder which is a partnership to a partner of such partnership, so long as such transfer is made pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, or to the transfer by gift, will or intestate succession by the holder to his or her spouse or lineal descendants or ancestors or any trust for the benefit of any of the foregoing if the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the same extent as if he/she were an original holder hereunder. notwithstanding the foregoing, such warrant shares may be offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with rule 144 promulgated under the act. 7. registration rights. 7.1. piggyback registration. if at any time, or from time to time, the company shall determine to register any of its equity securities, either for its own account or other holders, other than (i) a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, or (ii) a registration relating solely to a transaction identified in rule 145(a) of the act, the company will promptly give written notice thereof to the holder and include in such registration (and any related qualifications including compliance with blue sky laws), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the warrant shares requested to be included therein by the holder. 12 cusip no. 356870105 page 12 of 16 if the registration of which the company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving a firm commitment underwriting, the company shall so advise the holder as a part of the written notice. in such event, the right of the holder to registration shall be conditioned upon the holder's participation in such underwriting. all persons proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the company and the holder distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by the company. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 7.1, if the managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may limit or exclude the securities to be included in such registration. the company shall so advise the holder requesting to be included in the registration and underwriting, and the number of shares of securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among all the persons requesting to be included in the registration and underwriting in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to their respective amounts of securities proposed to be registered at the time of filing the registration statement. 7.2. s-3 registration. in case the company shall receive from the holder a written request that the company file a registration statement on form s-3 (or any successor form to form s-3) for a public offering of the warrant shares, the company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause such warrant shares to be registered for the offering on such form and to cause such warrant shares to be qualified in such jurisdictions as such holder may reasonably request. if such offer is to be an underwritten offer, the underwriters must be acceptable to both the holder and the company. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to this section 7.2 (i) if the company is not then currently eligible to use form s-3 for purposes of registering the warrant shares, (ii) following the filing of, and for 180 days immediately following the effective date of, any registration statement pertaining to securities of the company (other than a registration of securities in a transaction listed in rule 145(a) of the act or with respect to an employee benefit plan), provided that the company is actively employing its reasonable commercial efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, (iii) after the company has effected one registration pursuant to this section 7.2 and such registration has been declared effective, or (iv) if the company shall furnish to the holder a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors, it would be seriously detrimental to the company or its stockholders for a registration statement to be filed in the near future, then the company's obligation to use its reasonable commercial efforts to file a registration statement shall be deferred one or more times for a period or periods not to exceed 90 days in length in any 12-month period. 7.3. expenses of registration. all registration expenses, exclusive of underwriting discounts and selling commissions, incurred in connection with the registrations

will keep the holder advised in writing as to the initiation of such registration and as to the completion thereof. the company will: (a) prepare and file with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for at least 120 days or until the distribution described in the registration statement has been completed; 13 cusip no. 356870105 page 13 of 16 (b) furnish to the holder and to the underwriters of the securities being registered such reasonable number of copies of the registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus and such other documents as such persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public offering of such securities; (c) prepare and file with the securities and exchange commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement; (d) use its reasonable commercial efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the holder, provided that the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions; and (e) notify the holder at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the act of the happening of any event as a result which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of circumstances then existing. 7.5. indemnification. the company will indemnify the holder, each of such holder's officers and directors and partners, and each person controlling the holder within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such registration, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by the company of the act, the exchange act, state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under such laws applicable to the company in connection with any such registration, and the company will reimburse the holder, each of such holder's officers and directors, and each person controlling such holder, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by such holder or controlling person, and stated to be specifically for use therein. the holder will, if warrant shares held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration is being effected, indemnify the company, each of its directors and officers, other holders of the company's securities covered by such registration statement, each person who controls the company within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the holder of the act, the exchange act, state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under such laws applicable to the holder, and will reimburse the company, such other holders, such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, but only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company by the holder. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of the holder under this subsection shall be limited in an amount equal to the public offering price of the shares sold by such holder (less any underwriting discounts and commissions associated with such shares), unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful misconduct or fraud by the holder. 14 cusip no. 356870105 page 14 of 16 each party entitled to indemnification under this section 7.5 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense, and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this agreement unless the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action and provided further, that the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or there are separate and different defenses. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. no indemnified party shall consent to the entry of judgment or enter into any settlement for which indemnification is sought without the indemnifying party's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. 8. rights of stockholders. except as otherwise provided herein, no holder of this warrant shall be entitled, by virtue of its ownership of this warrant, to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of stock or any other securities of the company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof for any purpose, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the holder of this warrant, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization, issuance of stock, reclassification of stock, change of par value or change of stock to no par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance, or otherwise) or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this warrant has been exercised and the warrant shares shall have become deliverable, as provided herein.

to: freerealtime.com, inc., 1. the undersigned hereby elects to purchase ____________ shares of stock of freerealtime.com, inc., pursuant to the terms of the attached warrant, and tenders herewith payment of the purchase price of such shares in full, together with all applicable transfer taxes, if any. 2. please issue a certificate or certificates representing said shares of stock in the name of the undersigned or in such other name as is specified below: name: address: 3. the undersigned represents that the aforesaid shares of stock are being acquired for the account of the undersigned for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof and that the undersigned has no present intention of distributing or reselling such shares. in support thereof, the undersigned has executed an investment representation statement attached hereto as attachment b. holder by: name: title: date: 16 cusip no. 356870105 page 16 of 16 attachment b investment representation statement purchaser : company : freerealtime.com, inc. security : amount : $ date : in connection with the purchase of the above-listed securities and underlying stock (the "securities"), i, the purchaser, represent to the company the following: (a) i am aware of the company's business affairs and financial condition, and have acquired sufficient information about the company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the securities. i am purchasing these securities for my own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for the resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof for purposes of the securities act of 1933 ("securities act"). (b) i understand that the securities have not been registered under the securities act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of my investment intent as expressed herein. in this connection, i understand that, in the view of the securities and exchange commission ("sec"), the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if my representation was predicated solely upon a present intention to hold these securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the market price of the securities, or for a period of one year or any other fixed period in the future. (c) i further understand that the securities must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the securities act or unless an exemption from registration is otherwise available. moreover, i understand that the company is under no obligation to register the securities. in addition, i understand that the certificate evidencing the securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the securities unless they are registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the company. (d) i am aware of the provisions of rule 144, promulgated under the securities act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer thereof (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. (e) i further understand that at the time i wish to sell the securities there may be no public market upon which to make such a sale. (f) i further understand that in the event all of the requirements of rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the securities act, compliance with regulation a, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that rule 144 is not exclusive, the staff of the sec has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. holder by: name: title: date: -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
