offer price &#148;). upon successful completion of the offer, and subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, nomac will be merged with and into bronco (the &#147; merger &#148;), and bronco will survive the merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake (the &#147; surviving corporation &#148;). the merger agreement - 6 - provides that the merger may be consummated regardless of whether the offer is completed, but if the offer is not completed, the merger will only be able to be consummated after the stockholders of bronco have adopted the merger agreement at a meeting of stockholders. at the effective time of the merger (the &#147; effective time &#148;), each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by bronco, chesapeake or nomac or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, or by stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under delaware law) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the offer price (the &#147; merger consideration &#148;). in addition, each share that is restricted and is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest in full and become non-forfeitable immediately prior to the effective time and will be cancelled at the effective time and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. under the merger agreement, and upon the terms and conditions contained therein, nomac is obligated to commence the offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after april 14, 2011, the date of the merger agreement. the offer will remain open for at least 20 business days, which period may be extended under certain circumstances described in the merger agreement. nomac&#146;s obligation to accept for payment and pay for any shares tendered in the offer is subject to certain conditions, including (i) there having been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer a number of shares that represents at least a majority of the total number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, (ii) the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the offer under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder having been expired or terminated prior to the expiration date, (iii) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to bronco and (iv) certain other customary conditions. the offer is not subject to a financing condition. the merger agreement also provides that if nomac purchases shares pursuant to the offer, or if the effective time occurs, then the warrant (the &#147; warrant &#148;) related to the warrant agreement, dated september 18, 2009 (the &#147; warrant agreement &#148;), between bronco and banco inbursa s.a., instituci&oacute;n de banca multiple, grupo financiero imbursa (to the extent it is unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the conversion time (as defined below)),will terminate and the holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares that were purchasable upon exercise of the warrant as of the conversion time (determined without regard to any limitations set forth in the warrant as to the exercisability thereof) and (2) the offer price less the exercise price of the warrant as in effect as of the conversion time. the &#147; conversion time &#148; means the earliest to occur of (a) the effective time, (b) 20 business days after the expiration date of the offer or, if there is a subsequent offering period following the expiration date of the offer, the expiration of the last subsequent offering period and (3) september 1, 2011. bronco granted to nomac under the merger agreement an irrevocable option (the &#147; top-up option &#148;), exercisable after the consummation of the offer and prior to the effective time, to purchase at a price per share equal to the offer price up to that number of newly issued shares (the &#147; top-up shares &#148;) from bronco at a per share purchase price equal to the offer price that, when added to the number of shares owned by chesapeake and nomac at the time of exercise of the top-up option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the top-up shares on a fully diluted basis. if chesapeake and nomac shall acquire, together with the shares held by chesapeake, nomac and any other subsidiary of chesapeake, at least 90% of the outstanding shares, they will complete the merger through the &#147;short form&#148; procedures available under section 253 of the dgcl. the merger agreement also provides that, upon payment for shares representing at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of bronco&#146;s common stock on a fully diluted basis, nomac will be entitled to designate a number of directors to the board of directors of bronco (the &#147; bronco board &#148;) in proportion with the percentage of the shares it owns following the offer. between such time and the effective time, the bronco board will have at least two directors who are directors of bronco on the date of the merger agreement and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market. chesapeake, nomac and bronco have made customary representations and warranties in the merger agreement and agreed to certain customary covenants, including covenants regarding operation of the business of bronco and its subsidiaries prior to the closing. in addition, bronco has made certain covenants restricting bronco from soliciting, or providing information or entering into discussions concerning, proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions. however, bronco may take certain specified actions in response to an unsolicited proposal that the bronco board reasonably determines in good faith is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal superior to the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, if failure to take such actions would be reasonably expected to result in a breach of the bronco board&#146;s fiduciary duties and other specified conditions are met. in such circumstances, and subject to certain obligations to notify chesapeake and to other rights granted to chesapeake, including the right to require bronco to engage in good faith negotiations for an amendment to the merger agreement, the bronco board may cause bronco to terminate the merger agreement in response to such superior proposal. upon termination of the merger agreement in such circumstances or other specified circumstances, bronco will be required to pay chesapeake a termination fee of $13 million plus expenses of up to $1.5 million. moreover, if chesapeake terminates the merger agreement as a result of a breach of bronco&#146;s representations or warranties or bronco&#146;s failure to perform in any material respect under the merger agreement, which causes a failure of the - 7 - offer conditions and which is not cured, or if the offer expires or terminates without chesapeake or nomac having accepted for purchase any shares (other than due to a breach of the merger agreement by the terminating party), then bronco is required to pay chesapeake&#146;s reasonable out of pocket fees and expenses up to $1.5 million. the merger agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its terms. the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate. in addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the merger agreement and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of, or other investors in, bronco. bronco&#146;s stockholders and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of bronco, chesapeake, nomac or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. in connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, chesapeake and nomac entered into tender support agreements, dated as of april 14, 2011 (the &#147;

subject shares &#148;). in addition, such stockholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to vote the subject shares in favor of the merger and to refrain from disposing of the subject shares and soliciting alternative acquisition proposals to the merger. the tender support agreements will terminate upon certain circumstances, including upon termination of the merger agreement. as of april 14, 2011, the subject shares included 4,879,976 shares over which third avenue had sole voting and dispositive power on behalf of its investment advisory clients, 4,200,000 shares beneficially owned by inmobiliaria carso, s.a. de c.v. and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant, which represents the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to purchase up to 5,440,770 shares. the reporting persons may be deemed to have acquired shared voting and disposition power with respect to the subject shares by reason of the execution and delivery of the tender support agreements by chesapeake and nomac. as a result of nomac being its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiary, respectively, each of operating and nomac drilling may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the subject shares that nomac may be deemed to beneficially own. the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and tender support agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. the merger agreement and tender support agreements are referenced herein as exhibits 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and are incorporated by reference into this item 4. the purpose of the transactions described above is for chesapeake, through nomac, to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, bronco. chesapeake required that the supporting stockholders agree to enter into the stockholder support agreements to induce chesapeake and nomac to enter into the merger agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer and the merger. upon consummation of the merger, bronco will become a wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake, the shares will cease to be freely traded or listed, bronco common stock will be de-registered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and chesapeake will control the board of directors of bronco and will make such other changes in the charter, bylaws, capitalization, management and business of bronco as set forth in the merger agreement and/or as may be appropriate in its judgment (subject to certain limitations). except as set forth or incorporated by reference in this schedule 13d, chesapeake, operating, nomac drilling and nomac do not have any current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional shares or the disposition of shares; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving bronco or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of any material amount of assets of bronco or any of its subsidiaries;
