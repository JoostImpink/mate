3. any person other than monarch or any monarch subsidiary shall have made a bona fide proposal to scb or its shareholders, by public announcement or written communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure, to engage in an acquisition transaction (including, without limitation, any situation in which any person other than monarch or any subsidiary of monarch shall have commenced (as such term is defined in rule 14d-2 under the securities exchange act) or shall have filed a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any shares of scb common stock such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would own or control 10% or more of the then outstanding shares of scb common stock (such an offer being referred to herein as a "tender offer" or an "exchange offer", respectively)); 4. after a proposal is made by a third party to scb or its shareholders to engage in an acquisition transaction, scb shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the merger agreement and such breach would entitle monarch to terminate the merger agreement or the holders of scb common stock shall not have approved the merger agreement at the meeting of such shareholders held for the purpose of voting on the merger agreement, such meeting shall not have been held or shall have been canceled prior to termination of the merger agreement or scb's board of directors shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to monarch the recommendation of scb's board of directors with respect to the merger agreement; 5. any person other than monarch or any monarch subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which monarch has given its prior written consent or in connection with the exercise of options, warrants or other rights (or -9- in settlement or satisfaction of such rights) set forth in section 4.2(a) of the scb disclosure letter, shall have filed an application or notice with the federal reserve board or other governmental authority or regulatory or administrative agency or commission (each, a "governmental authority") for approval to engage in an acquisition transaction; or 6. the board of directors of scb does not recommend that the shareholders of scb approve the merger agreement. as provided in the option agreement, in the event that monarch is entitled and wishes to exercise the option, it must send to scb a written notice (the date of which is referred to in the option agreement as the "notice date") specifying (1) the total number of shares of scb common stock which monarch intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise, (2) the aggregate purchase price as provided herein, and (3) a period of time (not less than three business days, nor more than 30 business days) running from the notice date and a place at which the closing of such purchase shall take place; provided, however, that if prior notification to or approval of the federal reserve board or any other governmental authority is required in connection with such purchase, monarch will promptly file, and expeditiously process the required notice or application for approval. under the bhc act, monarch may not directly or indirectly acquire more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of scb without application to and prior approval from the federal reserve board. if scb enters into certain agreements relating to the consolidation or merger of scb or the sale of substantially all of its assets or deposits, scb is required to make proper provision so that the option will, upon consummation of such transaction, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option") in the surviving corporation in a consolidation or merger or in the transfer of substantially all of scb's assets or deposits, as the case may be. the substitute option will have the same terms and conditions as the option; provided, however, that to the extent terms and conditions of the substitute option cannot legally be identical to those of the option, they will in no event be less advantageous to monarch. in certain circumstances related to the exercise of the option, the time period specified in the option agreement will be extended at the request of monarch (1) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods and (2) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under section 16(b) of the securities exchange act by reason of such exercise; provided, however, that in no event shall any closing date occur more than six months after the related notice date. the option may be assigned by monarch in certain circumstances, subject to the terms and conditions described in the option agreement. -10- item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) as result of entry into the option agreement and the granting of the option thereunder, pursuant to rule 13d-3(d)(i) under the exchange act (defined above), monarch is deemed to own beneficially 1,491,050 shares of scb common stock (or such lesser amount as shall constitute 19.9% of the outstanding shares of scb common stock on the date of exercise), constituting approximately 19.9 percent of the shares of scb common stock issued and outstanding as of april 29, 1997. monarch expressly disclaims any beneficial ownership of the 1,491,050 shares of scb common stock which are obtainable by monarch upon exercise of the option, because the option is exercisable only in the circumstances set forth in the option agreement, which is described in item 4 hereof, none of which has occurred as of the date of hereof and only then with regulatory approval (if, as a consequence, monarch would own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of scb common stock). the fund, which holds 36.89 percent of the voting stock of monarch, is deemed pursuant to rule 13d-3(d)(i) under the exchange act indirectly to own beneficially 550,048 share of scb common stock in virtue of its ownership interest in monarch, constituting 7.34 percent of the shares of scb common stock issued and outstanding as of april 29,1997. the fund expressly disclaims any beneficial ownership of such shares of scb common stock. (b) if monarch were to exercise the option, it would have sole power to vote and, subject to the terms of the option agreement, sole power to direct the disposition of, the shares of scb common stock covered thereby. (c) other than as set forth herein, none of monarch, the fund or to the best knowledge of monarch and the fund, any of the directors or executive officers, general partners or any persons controlling monarch or the fund listed on annex a hereto has affected any transaction in shares of scb common stock during the past 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings, or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except as set forth above, none of monarch, the fund or to the best knowledge of monarch and the fund, any of the directors, executive officers, general partners or any person controlling monarch or the fund listed on annex a hereto has any contracts, arrangements, understandings, or relationships (legal or otherwise), with any person with respect to any securities of scb, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any securities of scb, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option agreements, put or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. copies of the merger agreement and the option agreement are filed as exhibits to this schedule 13d and are incorporated herein by reference. the summary descriptions of such documents set forth above are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibits. -11- signatures after reasonable inquiry and to the best knowledge and belief of each of the undersigned, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete, and correct. dated: may 9, 1997 monarch bancorp by: /s/ matthew p. wagner -------------------------- name: matthew p. wagner title: president castle creek capital partners fund-i l.p. by: castle creek capital, l.l.c. general partner by: eggemeyer advisory corp. member by: /s/ john m. eggemeyer, iii ------------------------------ name: john m. eggemeyer, iii title: president -12- annex a information on directors, executive officers, general partners and control persons the name, business address, present principal occupation, or employment and the name, principal business, and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted, of each of the directors and executive officers of monarch, the general partner of the fund and persons controlling monarch or the fund, are set forth below. unless otherwise specified, the persons listed below do not beneficially own any shares of scb common stock. principal occupation, shares of if other than as an scb common name and position with executive officer or stock owned business address monarch director of monarch beneficially - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- rice e. brown director owner and president none 27127 calle arroyo of rice brown suite 1907 financial services san juan capistrano, ca 92672 joseph j. digange director and chairman, none 1251 westwood blvd. western bank* los angeles, ca 90024 john m. eggemeyer director president of belle plaine none 4370 la jolla village dr. financial, l.l.c., belle plaine suite 400 partners, inc. and castle san diego, ca 92122 creek capital, l.l.c. arnold c. hahn executive vice president, none 30000 town center dr. chief financial officer laguna beach, ca 92667 and secretary b. scott hardt executive vice president none 1251 westwood blvd. and chief credit officer los angeles, ca 90024 john w. rose director executive vice president, none fnb corporation fnb corporation hermitage square hermitage, pa 16148 hugh s. smith, jr. director, chairman and none 1251 westwood blvd. chief executive officer los angeles, ca 90024 matthew p. wagner director and president;

whereas, the respective boards of directors of acquiror and scb believe that the proposed merger, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders; whereas, acquiror and scb desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement; whereas, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the merger (i) for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code") and (ii) for accounting purposes shall qualify as a "pooling of interests"; and whereas, concurrently herewith, scb and acquiror are entering into a stock option agreement, to be dated as of the date hereof, whereby scb will grant to acquiror the option to purchase up to 19.9% of the outstanding scb common stock (as defined below) upon the occurrence of certain events; now, therefore, on the basis of the foregoing recitals and in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, acquiror and scb hereby agree as follows: article i the merger 1.1 the merger. the merger shall become effective (the "effective time") upon the filing of an agreement of merger with the california secretary of state in accordance with the provisions of the california general corporation law (the "cgcl"). at the effective time, scb shall be merged with and into acquiror with acquiror being the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, the cgcl. the separate corporate existence of scb shall thereupon cease. 1.2 articles of incorporation and bylaws. (a) the articles of incorporation of acquiror as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation immediately after the effective time. (b) the bylaws of acquiror as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the bylaws of the surviving corporation immediately after the effective time. 1.3 directors and officers. (a) the directors of acquiror immediately prior to the effective time shall be the directors of the surviving corporation as of the effective time and until their successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance with applicable law. (b) the officers of acquiror immediately prior to the effective time shall be the officers of the surviving corporation as of the effective time until their successors are duly appointed or elected in accordance with applicable law. article ii conversion of shares 2.1 conversion of scb common stock. (a) at the effective time, each share of common stock, no par value, of scb (the "scb common stock"), which is held in the treasury of scb and each share of scb common stock owned by acquiror or any subsidiary of acquiror immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall, by virtue of the merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor. (b) subject to sections 2.1(a), 2.3 and 2.4, each issued and outstanding share of scb common stock shall, at the effective time, be converted into that number of shares of common stock, no par value, of acquiror ("acquiror common stock"), equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) $14.25 by (ii) the average price. as used herein, "average price" shall mean the volume weighted average sales price per share of acquiror common stock for each of the twenty (20) consecutive days (the "determination period") on which shares of acquiror common stock are actually traded (each, a "trading day") immediately preceding the regulatory approval date; provided, however, that if the first trading day of the determination period would occur on or prior to the tenth trading day after the ccb closing date, then the determination period shall be the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately following the 2 tenth trading day after the ccb closing date; provided, further, that if the average price as so computed would be less than $2.75, then the average price shall be $2.75; and provided further, that if the average price as so computed would be greater than $3.75, then the average price shall be $3.75. if acquiror effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction after the date hereof and prior to the effective time, the provisions of this section 2.1(b) shall be appropriately adjusted. the shares of acquiror common stock into which scb common stock shall be converted pursuant to this section 2.1(b), together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid pursuant to section 2.1(e), are collectively sometimes referred to herein as the "merger consideration". for purposes of determining the "volume weighted average", the aggregate of the daily sales for each of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days used in the determination of average price shall be divided by the aggregate number of shares traded during such twenty (20) consecutive trading days. as used herein, "ccb closing date" means the date on which the merger of california commercial bankshares with and into acquiror shall have become effective under the cgcl, "daily sales" means the reported sales prices of acquiror common stock traded on the nasdaq national market on a particular trading day and "regulatory approval date" means the date which is the later to occur of approval by (i) the board of governors of the federal reserve system pursuant to section 3 of the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and (ii) the california superintendent of banks pursuant to section 700 et seq. of the california financial code. (c) as a result of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, at the effective time all shares of scb common stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of shares of scb common stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of scb common stock, except the right to receive, without interest, such holder's pro rata portion of the merger consideration upon the surrender of a certificate representing such shares of scb common stock (a "certificate"). (d) at the effective time, each option or right to purchase shares of scb common stock (an "option") outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, by virtue of the merger and without any further action on the part of scb or the holder of any such option, in settlement thereof, be converted into the right to receive for each share otherwise issuable upon exercise thereof a number of shares of acquiror common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the spread by the average price. as used herein, "spread" means the difference, if positive, obtained by subtracting the exercise price of such option from $14.25. (e) no fractional shares of acquiror common stock shall be issued pursuant hereto. in lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of acquiror common 3 stock pursuant to section 2.1(b) hereof, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in respect of any fractional share of acquiror common stock that would otherwise be issuable. the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to such fractional proportion of the average price. 2.2 exchange procedures. (a) as of the effective time, acquiror shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with such bank or trust company as acquiror shall elect (which may be a subsidiary of acquiror) and is reasonably acceptable to scb (the "exchange agent"), for the benefit of the holders of scb common stock for exchange in accordance with this article ii, certificates ("acquiror certificates") representing the shares of acquiror's common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares to be exchanged pursuant to this article ii for outstanding shares of scb common stock. (b) as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent shall mail to each holder of record of scb common stock immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any shares of scb common stock which will be canceled pursuant to section 2.1(a) or dissenting shares) (a) a letter of transmittal (the "letter of transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as acquiror shall specify), (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the merger consideration with respect to the shares of scb common stock formerly represented thereby, and (c) in the case of holders of more than five percent of scb common stock at the effective time, the letter referred to in section 8.9(b) hereof. (c) upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent, together with the letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as acquiror or the exchange agent shall reasonably request, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor (a) an acquiror certificate representing that number of shares of acquiror common stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this article ii, and (b) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. until surrendered as contemplated by this section 2.2, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to the shares of scb common stock formerly represented thereby. (d) acquiror shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement, governing the issuance and delivery of acquiror certificates into which shares of scb common stock are converted in the merger. 4 2.3 dividends, etc. (a) notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared after the effective time on acquiror common stock shall be paid with respect to any shares of scb common stock represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein. following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the acquiror certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of acquiror common stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of acquiror common stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon. (b) at or after the effective time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of scb of the shares of scb common stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates representing any such shares are presented to the surviving corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates for the consideration, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article ii. certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of the company for purposes of rule 145(c) under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), shall not be exchanged until the acquiror has received a written agreement from such person pursuant to section 8.9 hereof. (c) any portion of the aggregate merger consideration (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any shares of acquiror common stock) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the acquiror and scb six months after the effective time shall be delivered to the acquiror. any former shareholders of scb who have not theretofore complied with this article ii shall thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the acquiror common stock deliverable in respect of each share of scb common stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. (d) none of scb, acquiror, the surviving corporation, the exchange agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of scb common stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(c) certain actions, applications and arrangements. issuer shall promptly take all action as may from time to time be required (including (i) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in 15 u.s.c. section 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) in the event, under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended ("bhc act"), or the change in bank control act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking law, prior approval of or notice to the federal reserve board or to any other governmental authority is necessary before the option may be exercised, cooperating with grantee in preparing such applications or notices and providing such information to each such governmental authority as it may require) in order to permit grantee to exercise the option and issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of common stock pursuant hereto. section 4. exchange of option. this agreement and the option granted hereby are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of grantee, upon presentation and surrender of this agreement at the principal office of issuer, for other agreements providing for options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder. the terms "agreement" and "option" as used in this section 4 include any agreements and related options for which this agreement and the option granted hereby may be exchanged. upon receipt by issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this agreement, if mutilated, issuer will execute and deliver a new agreement of like tenor and date. any such new agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of issuer, whether or not 6 the agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone. section 5. adjustments. the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the option shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) in the event of any change in the common stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like, the type and number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise hereof shall be appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall be made so that, in the event that any additional shares of common stock are to be issued or otherwise to become outstanding as a result of any such change (other than pursuant to an exercise of the option or any other options, warrants or other rights (or in settlement or satisfaction of such rights) set forth in section 4.2(a) of the scb disclosure letter), the number of shares of common stock that remain subject to the option shall be increased so that, after such issuance and together with shares of common stock previously issued pursuant to the exercise of the option (as adjusted on account of any of the foregoing changes in the common stock), it represents the same proportion of the number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding as such proportion before the applicable event described in this section 5(a). (b) whenever the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this section 5, the option price shall be adjusted by multiplying the option price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of common stock purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of common stock purchasable after the adjustment. section 6. registration rights. (a) upon the occurrence of a purchase event that occurs prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall, at the request of grantee (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of the option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of common stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare and file a registration statement under the securities act covering any shares issued and issuable pursuant to the option and shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and to remain current and effective for a reasonable period after such registration statement first becomes effective, in order to permit the sale or other disposition of any shares of common stock issued upon total or partial exercise of the option ("option shares") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by grantee; provided, however, that issuer may postpone filing a registration statement relating to a registration request by grantee under this section 6 for a period of time (not in excess of 30 days) if in its judgment such filing would require the disclosure of 7 material information that issuer has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential. grantee shall have the right to demand one such registration at the issuer's expense and additional registrations at its own expense. the foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by grantee for registration of option shares as provided above, issuer is in the process of registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering, the offering or inclusion of the option shares would interfere materially with the successful marketing of the shares of common stock offered by issuer, the number of option shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, however, that after any such required reduction, the number of option shares to be included in such offering for the account of grantee shall constitute at least 33 1/3% of the total number of shares of common stock held by grantee and issuer covered in such registration statement; provided further, however, that if such reduction occurs, then issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable thereafter as to which no reduction pursuant to this section 6(a) shall be permitted or occur, and the grantee shall thereafter be entitled to one additional registration statement at the grantee's expense. in addition, if the company proposes to register its common stock or any other securities on a form that would permit the registration of the option shares for public sale under the securities act (whether proposed to be offered for sale by the issuer or any other person) it will give prompt written notice to grantee of its intention to do so, specifying the relevant terms of such proposal, including the proposed maximum offering price thereof. upon the written request of the grantee delivered to the issuer within 10 business days after the giving of any such notice, which request shall specify the number of option shares desired to be disposed by grantee, the company will use its best efforts to effect, in connection with its proposed registration, the registration under the securities act of the option shares set forth in such request. the grantee shall be entitled to two such registrations at the issuer's expense and additional registrations at its own expense. grantee shall provide all information reasonably requested by issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. in connection with any such registration, issuer and grantee shall provide each other with representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily given in connection with such registrations. if requested by grantee in connection with such registration, issuer and grantee shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such option shares, but only to the extent of obligating themselves in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements. notwithstanding the foregoing, if grantee revokes any option notice or fails to exercise any option with respect to any option notice pursuant to section 2(e) hereof, issuer shall not be obligated to continue any registration process with respect to the sale of option shares issuable upon the exercise of such option and grantee shall not be deemed to have demanded registration of option shares. (b) in the event that grantee requests issuer to file a registration statement following the failure to obtain any approval required to exercise the option as described 8 in section 8 hereof, the closing of the sale or other disposition of the common stock or other securities pursuant to such registration statement shall occur substantially simultaneously with the exercise of the option. section 7. substitute option. (a) grant of substitute option. in the event that prior to an exercise termination event, issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate or merge with any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, to merge into issuer and issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of common stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its or any material subsidiary's assets to any person, other than grantee or a grantee subsidiary, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the option shall, upon the consummation of such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "substitute option"), at the election of grantee, of either (x) the acquiring corporation (as defined below) or (y) any person that controls the acquiring corporation (the acquiring corporation and any such controlling person being hereinafter referred to as the "substitute option issuer"). (b) exercise of substitute option. the substitute option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of the substitute common stock (as defined below) as is equal to (i) the product of the market price (as defined below) multiplied by the number of shares of the issuer common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable, (ii) divided by the average price (as defined below). the exercise price of the substitute option per share of the substitute common stock (the "substitute purchase price") shall then be equal to the product of the option price multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares of common stock for which the option was theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number of shares for which the substitute option is exercisable. for purposes of this agreement, the term "market price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of common stock paid or to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with issuer (whether by way of a merger, consolidation or otherwise) and (ii) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of issuer as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm selected by grantee divided by the number of shares of common stock of issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. in determining the market price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be the value determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm selected by grantee whose determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. 9 (c) terms of substitute option. the substitute option shall otherwise have the same terms as the option, provided, however, that if the terms of the substitute option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to grantee. (d) substitute option definitions. the following terms have the meanings indicated: (i) "acquiring corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with issuer (if other than issuer), (ii) issuer in a merger in which issuer is the continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or any substantial part of the issuer's assets (or the assets of any issuer subsidiary); (ii) "substitute common stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the substitute option issuer upon exercise of the substitute option; and (iii) "average price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the substitute common stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the shares of the substitute common stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; provided, however, that if such closing price is not ascertainable due to an absence of a public market for the substitute common stock, "average price" shall mean the higher of (i) the price per share of substitute common stock paid or to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with the issuer of the substitute common stock and (ii) the book value per share, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, of the substitute common stock immediately prior to exercise of the substitute option; provided, further, that if issuer is the issuer of the substitute option, the average price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by issuer, the person merging into issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such merging person, as grantee may elect. (e) cap on substitute option. in no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the substitute option be exercisable for more than that proportion of the outstanding substitute common stock equal to the proportion of the outstanding common stock of the issuer which the grantee had the right to acquire immediately prior to the issuance of the substitute option. in the event that the substitute option would be exercisable for more than the proportion of the outstanding substitute common stock referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph but for this clause (e), the substitute option issuer shall make a cash payment to grantee equal to the excess of (i) the value of the substitute option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the substitute option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). this difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by grantee and the substitute option issuer. 10 section 8. extension of exercise right. notwithstanding sections 2 and 6 hereof, if grantee has given the notice referred to in one or more of such sections, the exercise of the rights specified in any such section shall be extended (a) if the exercise of such rights requires obtaining regulatory approvals (including any required waiting periods) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights, and (b) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under section 16(b) of the securities exchange act by reason of such exercise; provided, however, that in no event shall any closing date occur more than six months after the related notice date, and, if the closing date shall not have occurred within such period due to the failure to obtain any required approval by the federal reserve board or any other governmental authority despite the best efforts of issuer or the substitute option issuer, as the case may be, to obtain such approvals, the exercise of the option shall be deemed to have been rescinded as of the related notice date. in the event (a) grantee receives official notice that an approval of the federal reserve board or any other governmental authority required for the purchase and sale of the option shares will not be issued or granted or (b) a closing date has not occurred within six months after the related notice date due to the failure to obtain any such required approval, grantee shall be entitled to exercise the option in connection with the resale of the option shares pursuant to a registration statement as provided in section 6. section 9. issuer's representations and warranties. issuer hereby represents and warrants to grantee as follows: (a) corporate authority. issuer has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the execution and delivery of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly approved by the board of directors of issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of issuer are necessary to authorize this agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of, issuer, enforceable against issuer in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought; and (b) availability of shares. issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the option, that number of shares of common stock equal to the maximum number of shares of common stock at any time and from 11 time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrances and security interests. section 10. assignment. (a) assignment. neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this agreement or the option created hereunder to any other person without the express written consent of the other party, except that grantee may assign this agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee and grantee may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in part after the occurrence of a preliminary purchase event; provided, however, that until the date at which the federal reserve board has approved an application by grantee under the bhc act to acquire the shares of common stock subject to the option, other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee, grantee may not assign its rights under the option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the federal reserve board. the term "grantee" as used in this agreement shall also be deemed to refer to grantee's permitted assigns. any attempted assignment prohibited by this section 10 is void and without effect.
