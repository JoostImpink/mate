(c) any person acquires beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or any group is formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficially ownership of, 10% or more of the then outstanding shares; or (d) the holders of shares do not approve the merger agreement at the meeting of such shareholders held for the purchase of voting on the merger agreement, or such meeting is not held or is cancelled prior to termination of the merger agreement, or issuer's board of directors withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse to vallicorp the unanimous recommendation of issuer's board of director's with respect to the merger agreement, in each case after any person shall have (i) publicly announced a proposal, or publicly disclosed an intention to make a proposal, to engage in an acquisition transaction, or (ii) filed an application (or given an notice) under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, or the change in bank control act of 1978 for approval to engage in an acquisition 10 transaction. notwithstanding the foregoing, the option may not be exercised if either (a) any required governmental approvals have not been obtained with respect to such exercise or if such exercise would violate any applicable regulatory restrictions, or (b) at the time of exercise, vallicorp is failing in any material respect to perform or observe its covenants or conditions under the merger agreement. the investment agreement provides that vallicorp may assign and transfer the option at any time after the option becomes exercisable. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. ------------------------------------ (a) under the terms of the shareholder agreement, the bound shareholders have agreed to vote or cause to be voted the 251,175 shares beneficially owned by them in the manner specified in item 4. such amount is as of march 15, 1996, and includes 5,350 shares subject to options held by bound shareholders that were exercisable within 60 days of march 15, 1996. vallicorp, therefore, beneficially owns by reason of the shareholder agreement for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act 251,175 shares. in addition, pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement, vallicorp has the right to acquire, under certain circumstances, 199,986 shares, which it therefore beneficially owns for purposes of rule 13d-3, solely by reason of its right to acquire such shares pursuant to the investment agreement. the total number of shares which vallicorp beneficially owns for purposes of rule 13d-3 is 451,161 shares, which is the 11 total of the shares beneficially owned as described in the preceding two paragraphs. the 451,161 shares beneficially owned is 37.3% of the sum of the shares of (i) the number of shares of issuer outstanding (1,004,955) as of march 15, 1996 according to issuer's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 1995, (ii) the 5,350 shares acquirable by bound shareholders upon exercise of options held by them, and (iii) the 199,986 shares issuable to vallicorp if the option under the investment agreement were exercised. (b) unless and until the exercise of the option to purchase shares under the investment agreement, vallicorp does not have the power to vote or direct the vote, or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of, the 199,986 shares subject to the option; however, vallicorp has the right to dispose of its rights under the investment agreement at such time as the option becomes exercisable. see item 4 above. vallicorp has shared power to vote or direct the vote of 251,175 shares subject to the shareholder agreement insofar as vallicorp has the power to vote and direct the vote of such shares solely with respect to a vote by shareholders of the issuer to approve the merger, the merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby and in opposition to any proposal or transaction that would in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent, or nullify the merger, the merger agreement, or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby. the name, business or residence address, present occupation or employment, and citizenship of each of the bound 12 shareholders is set forth in item 3 above. during the past five (5) years, none of the bound shareholders has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgement, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. (c) except as described above, neither vallicorp nor any person named in paragraph 2 above owns beneficially any shares or has effected any transaction in shares during the sixty (60) days preceding the date of this statement. (d) to the best knowledge of vallicorp, the shares which are subject to the investment agreement have not been issued and therefore no persons presently have the right to receive the dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, such shares. the shareholder agreement does not address the rights of the parties thereto to receive the dividends from, and the proceeds from the sale of, the shares subject to such agreement. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings, or relationships with respect ---------------------------------------------------------------------- to securities of the issuer. - --------------------------- other than as indicated elsewhere in this statement, neither vallicorp nor any of the persons named in item 2 hereof is a party to any contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship (legal 13 or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to, the transfer or voting of any of the issuer's securities, finders' fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. -------------------------------- the following are filed as exhibits to this statement: exhibit "a" - merger agreement (being the agreement and plan of ----------- reorganization between vallicorp holdings, inc. and auburn bancorp, inc. dated as of march 27, 1996), which is exhibit "b" to vallicorp's current report on form 8-k (commission file number 18202) filed with the commission with a date of report of march 27, 1996, and which is incorporated herein from such filing; exhibit "b" - form of shareholder agreement dated as of march 27, 1996, ----------- which is exhibit 9.1 included within exhibit "a" and is incorporated herein from the same filing referred to in the preceding paragraph; exhibit "c" - form of investment agreement dated as of march 27, 1996, ----------- which is exhibit 9.2 included within exhibit "a" and is incorporated herein from the same filing referred to in the paragraph preceding the preceding paragraph. after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, i certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete, and correct. 14 vallicorp holdings, inc. dated: april 24, 1996 by: /s/ e.l. herbert -------------------------- e.l. herbert executive vice president/ general counsel 15 exhibit index ------------- exhibit ------- description letter ----------- ------ "a" merger agreement (being the agreement and plan of reorganization between vallicorp holdings, inc. and auburn bancorp, inc. dated as of march 27, 1996)/(1)/ "b" form of shareholder agreement dated as of march 27, 1996/(2)/ "c" form of investment agreement dated as of march 27, 1996/(3)/ - ----------------------------- (1) incorporated herein by reference to vallicorp's current report on form 8-k (commission number 18202) bearing a date of report of march 27, 1996 (the "march 27 form 8-k"), where such merger agreement appears as exhibit "b."
