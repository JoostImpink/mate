below). item 1. security and issuer this statement on schedule 13d (this &#147;statement&#148;) relates to the shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the &#147;common stock&#148;), of unioil, a nevada corporation (&#147;unioil&#148;), which has its principal executive office at 3817 carson avenue, evans, colorado 80620. item 2. identity and background this statement is being filed by petroleum development corporation, a nevada corporation (&#147;pdc&#148;). the address of pdc&#146;s principal office is 103 east main street, bridgeport, west virginia 26330. pdc&#146;s principal business is to develop, produce and market natural gas and oil. the name, citizenship, business address, present principal occupation or employment, and the name and principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted, of each of the executive officers and directors of pdc are as set forth in annex i hereto and incorporated herein by reference. during the last five years, neither pdc nor any of the individuals listed in annex i has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration pdc, wattenberg acquisition corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of pdc (&#147;sub&#148;), and unioil have entered into a tender offer agreement, dated as of october 19, 2006 (the &#147;tender offer agreement&#148;), which contemplates the acquisition by sub of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $1.91 per share. as an inducement for pdc to enter into the tender offer agreement, charles e. ayers, jr., the chairman, president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer of unioil, and four members of his family (the &#147;principal stockholders&#148;), have entered into a stockholder tender agreement with pdc dated as of october 19, 2006 (the &#147;stockholder tender agreement&#148;). to the knowledge of pdc, the principal stockholders collectively own of record 7,801,939 shares of common stock. of this total, charles e. ayers, jr. owns 6,851,983 shares and each of the four members of his family who are party to the stockholder tender agreement own 237,489 shares. pdc expects that the consideration paid by it or sub to the holders of common stock pursuant to the tender offer agreement will be financed through cash on hand and its other working capital resources. copies of the tender offer agreement and the stockholder tender agreement are filed herewith as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, and are incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the tender offer agreement provides that as promptly as practicable after the date of the tender offer agreement but in no event later than 3 ten business days after such date, sub will commence a tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the &#147;offer&#148;), at a price in cash equal to $1.91 per share of common stock. the tender offer agreement further provides that, following successful completion of the offer (the &#147;offer closing&#148;), sub will be merged with and into unioil (the &#147;merger&#148;). if more than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock are tendered in the offer, the merger may be effected without approval of or notice to the remaining stockholders of unioil. if less than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock are tendered in the offer, the merger will require the approval of the holders of a majority of the common stock. sub, representing approximately 81.8% of the common stock, will vote its shares in favor of the merger. at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares of common stock that are held by unioil as treasury stock or owned by pdc or sub, and other than shares of common stock that are held by stockholders, if any, who properly exercise dissenters&#146; rights under nevada law) will be converted into the right to receive $1.91 in cash, without interest. each of the offer and the merger are subject to customary closing conditions. pursuant to the stockholder tender agreement, the principal stockholders have agreed, among other things, to tender or cause to be tendered to sub, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock beneficially owned by the principal stockholders (the &#147;shares&#148;) in the offer, regardless of whether a higher offer for the shares has been made by any person; (b) except for tendering the shares in accordance with the stockholder tender agreement, not to (i) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, the sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any or all of the shares, (ii) except with respect to matters not covered by the stockholder tender agreement, grant any proxies or powers of attorney in respect of the shares, deposit any of the shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of the shares and (iii) take any action that would have the effect of preventing or disabling (x) the principal stockholders from performing their obligations under the stockholder tender agreement or (y) parent, sub or their designees from exercising their rights under the stockholder tender agreement; (c) to vote or cause to be voted all of the shares, in the event any such matter is submitted to the vote of holders of common stock, (i) in favor of approval and adoption of the tender offer agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the stockholder tender agreement and the tender offer agreement and (ii) against any alternative acquisition (as such term is defined in the tender offer agreement), or any other matters which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay or materially adversely affect the offer, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the stockholder tender agreement and the tender offer agreement; and (d) to revoke any and all previous proxies with respect to any of the shares and grant to pdc and such individuals or corporations as pdc may designate an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the shares beneficially owned by the principal stockholder on any matters which may be presented to holders of common stock with respect to the matters referred to in (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. the stockholder tender agreement will terminate upon the earliest of the offer closing, simultaneously with the termination of the tender offer agreement by mutual consent or by reason of a breach by parent or sub of their obligations thereunder, or the 10 th day following the termination of the tender offer agreement for any other reason. 4 the principal stockholders have further agreed, as provided in the stockholder tender agreement, to grant to pdc a 10-day option to purchase the shares at a price greater than or equal to the offer price, such option to become exercisable upon the termination of the tender offer agreement. the purpose of the stockholder tender agreement is to induce pdc to enter into the stockholder tender agreement and to increase the likelihood that pdc, sub and unioil will successfully consummate the transactions contemplated by the tender offer agreement. if the merger is consummated as planned, unioil will become a wholly owned subsidiary of pdc and pdc will seek to cause the common stock to be deregistered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. the foregoing summary of certain provisions of the tender offer agreement and the stockholder tender agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, filed herewith as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer as a result of the stockholder tender agreement, pdc may be deemed to have beneficial ownership (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) of 7,801,939 shares

conditions and limitations set forth in the stockholder tender agreement. apart from the terms and conditions set forth in the tender offer agreement and the stockholder tender agreement, pdc is not
