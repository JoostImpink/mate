(a) revenues. to the extent that the company's and the surviving corporation's aggregate audited revenues for the first six (6) months of calendar year 2000 are (i) less than one million four hundred thousand dollars ($1,400,000) on an accrual basis in accordance with gaap, the merger consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to five dollars ($5.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) in revenue less than one million four hundred thousand ($1,400,000), and (ii) greater than one million four hundred thousand dollars ($1,400,000) on an accrual basis in accordance with gaap, the merger consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to five dollars ($5.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) in revenue greater than one million four hundred thousand dollars ($1,400,000). for example, in the event the revenues for such period, are one million three hundred thousand dollars ($1,300,000), the merger consideration would be decreased by five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (i.e. the $100,000 shortfall multiplied by 5.00). for purposes of this paragraph, the revenue calculations shall be made in the same manner in which bol's accountants audit the company's revenues for calendar year 1999 (i.e. on an accrual basis in accordance with gaap). in no event shall the adjustments under this section reduce the merger consideration below $1,500,000. (b) to the extent that the company's and the surviving corporation's ebitda for the first six (6) months of calendar year 2000 is less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the audited revenues for such period, the merger consideration shall be reduced by fourteen dollars and twenty-eight cents ($14.28) for each one dollar of revenue less than such minimum ebitda amount. for example, in the event that the company's audited revenues as determined in section 2.2(a) above were $1,400,000 and the company's ebitda is actually $470,000, then the merger consideration would be reduced by $285,600 (i.e. the $20,000 ebitda shortfall (35% of $1,400,000 less $470,000) times 14.28). for purposes of calculations made pursuant to this section 2.2(b), the company's and the surviving corporation's expenses shall include the parent's allocation of overhead charges for: (i) insurance, payroll services and other regular operating expenses attributable to the surviving corporation's business and (ii) the surviving corporation's pro rata share for use of the parent's albany data center (if any). there shall be no allocation of overhead charge for the parent's wall, new jersey office or executive officers' salaries. (c) to the extent any decrease in the merger consideration is required under this section 2.2, the stockholder shall make such payment within five (5) business days of the delivery of the income statement to the extent any increase or decrease in the merger consideration is required under this section 2.2, the surviving corporation or stockholders, as the case may be, shall pay such amount in parent stock and such shares of stock would be valued at the "average nasdaq national market price" for the twenty (20) business day period immediately preceding the date of delivery of the income statement or the date of resolution of any dispute regarding any merger consideration adjustment. 2.3 dispute resolution procedure for adjustments based on merger consideration adjustments. notwithstanding anything in this section 2 to the contrary, if the stockholders dispute the determination of the minimum cash requirement or any item contained on the 5 income statement, the stockholders shall notify the surviving corporation in writing of each disputed item (collectively, the "disputed amounts"), and specify the amount thereof in dispute within thirty (30) business days after determination of the minimum cash requirement or the delivery of the income statement, as the case may be. if the surviving corporation and the stockholders cannot resolve any such dispute, then such dispute shall be resolved by an independent nationally recognized accounting firm which is reasonably acceptable to the surviving corporation and the stockholders (the "independent accounting firm"). the determination of the independent accounting firm shall be made as promptly as practical and shall be final and binding on the parties, absent manifest error which error may only be corrected by such independent accounting firm. any expenses relating to the engagement of the independent accounting firm shall be allocated between the surviving corporation and the stockholders so that the stockholders' aggregate share of such costs shall bear the same proportion to the total costs that the disputed amounts unsuccessfully contested by the stockholders (as finally determined by the independent accounting firm) bear to the total of the disputed amounts so submitted to the independent accounting firm. section 3. representations and warranties of the company and the stockholders. 3.1 making of representations and warranties. as a material inducement to bol to enter into this agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the company and the stockholders hereby jointly and severally make to bol the representations and warranties contained in this section 3. 3.2 organization and qualification of the company. the company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of new york with full corporate power and authority to own or lease the company's properties and to conduct the company's business in the manner and in the places where such properties are owned or leased and where such business is currently conducted or proposed to be conducted. the copies of the certificate of incorporation of the company as amended to date, certified by the secretary of state for the state of new york and the bylaws certified by the secretary of the company and heretofore delivered to bol's counsel, are complete and correct, and no amendments thereto are pending. the stock records and minute books of the company which have heretofore been delivered to bol's counsel are correct and complete. the company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction in which it owns, operates or leases real property and in each other jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified or registered would have a material adverse effect on the properties, assets, business, financial condition and prospects of the company. 3.3 subsidiaries;

penalties, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of attorneys, accountants and consultants) of any kind or nature whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims 35 and including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing) sustained, suffered or incurred by or made against any parent indemnified party (a "loss" or "losses"), arising out of, based upon or in connection with: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the company or the stockholders in this agreement or in any schedule, exhibit, certificate, agreement or other instrument delivered under or in connection with this agreement, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of any matter or thing covered by any such representations or warranties (collectively, "parent representation and warranty claims"); (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the company or the stockholders in this agreement or in any schedule, exhibit, certificate, agreement or other instrument delivered under or in connection with this agreement, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of any matter or thing covered by any such covenant or agreement; (c) with respect to taxes of the company incurred with respect to any pre-closing tax period (as defined below) to the extent such liability exceeds the amounts accrued therefor and disclosed to bol in schedule 3.7 hereto (it being understood that such schedule shall be updated as of the closing to reflect tax accruals as of such date consistent with the company's past practices); the term "pre-closing tax period" shall mean all taxable periods ending on or before the closing date and the portion (ending on the closing date) of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the closing date; or (d) any claim, action, proceeding, liability or other matter arising from or related

parties to recover indemnification in respect of any occurrence referred to in clauses (b) and (c) of this section 12.1 shall not be limited by the fact that such occurrence may not constitute an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty referred to in clause (a) of this section 12.1. 12.2 notice; defense of claims. promptly after receipt by a parent indemnified party of notice of any claim, liability or expense to which the indemnification obligations hereunder would apply, the parent indemnified party shall give notice thereof in writing to the stockholders, but the omission to so notify the stockholders promptly will not relieve the stockholders from any liability except to the extent that the stockholders shall have been prejudiced as a result of the failure or delay in giving such notice. such notice shall state the information then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim, liability or expense and shall specify the provision or provisions of this agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted. if within twenty (20) days after receiving such notice the stockholders give written notice to the parent indemnified party stating that (i) it would be liable under the provisions hereof for indemnity in the amount of such claim if such claim were successful and (ii) that it disputes and intends to defend against such claim, liability 36 or expense at its own cost and expense, then counsel for the defense shall be selected by the stockholders (subject to the consent of the parent indemnified party which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) and the parent indemnified party shall not be required to make any payment with respect to such claim, liability or expense as long as the stockholders are conducting a good faith and diligent defense at their own expense; provided, however, that the assumption of defense of any such matters by the stockholders shall relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject or potentially subject to indemnification. the stockholders shall have the right, with the consent of the parent indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to settle any parent indemnified claims by third parties which are susceptible to being settled provided its obligation to indemnify the parent indemnified party therefor will be fully satisfied. the stockholders shall keep the parent indemnified party apprised of the status of the claim, liability or expense and any resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the parent indemnified party with all documents and information that the parent indemnified party shall reasonably request and shall consult with the parent indemnified party prior to acting on major matters, including settlement discussions. notwithstanding anything herein stated, the parent indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided, however, if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the stockholders and the parent indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel for the parent indemnified party shall be paid by the stockholders. if no such notice of intent to dispute and defend is given by the stockholders, or if such diligent good faith defense is not being or ceases to be conducted, the parent indemnified party shall, at the expense of the stockholders, undertake the defense of (with counsel selected by the parent indemnified party), and shall have the right to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment), such claim, liability or expense. if such claim, liability or expense is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely by the stockholders, then the parent indemnified party shall make available all information and assistance that the stockholders may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the stockholders in such defense. section 13. miscellaneous. 13.1 law governing. this
