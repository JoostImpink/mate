exchange of certificates section 2.1. conversion of securities. at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of acquiror merger subsidiary, the company or the holders of any of the following securities: (a) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the company (the "company stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than any shares of company stock to be cancelled pursuant to section 2.1(b) and any dissenting shares), shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to the indemnification provisions of article 8 hereof, (i) that number equal to the stock conversion number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of acquiror stock (the "stock merger consideration") and (ii) cash in an amount equal to the cash conversion number (the "cash merger consideration", and together with the stock merger consideration, the "merger consideration"). at the effective time, all shares of company stock (the "shares") shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and certificates previously evidencing any such shares (each, a "certificate") shall thereafter represent the right to receive, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with the provisions of section 2.2, but subject to the indemnification provisions of article 8 hereof, the stock merger consideration and cash merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares represented by such certificate, and a holder of more than one certificate shall have the right to receive the stock merger consideration and cash merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares represented by all such certificates (the "exchange merger consideration"). the holders of such certificates previously evidencing such shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the stock merger consideration to be received by any stockholder prior to the termination of the escrow indemnity period shall be adjusted to give full effect to the indemnification provisions in article 8 hereof. (b) each share held in the treasury of the company and each share owned by acquiror or any direct or indirect subsidiary of acquiror immediately prior to the effective time shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. (c) each share of common stock of acquiror merger subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the surviving corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation. (d) in lieu of issuing fractional shares, acquiror shall convert a holder's right to receive shares of acquiror stock pursuant to sections 2.1(a) and section 2.1(e) into a right to receive the highest whole number of shares of acquiror stock constituting the non-cash portion of the exchange merger consideration to be received plus cash equal to the fraction of a share of acquiror stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled (in each case after giving effect to section 1.2(e) hereof) multiplied by the determination price, and the exchange merger consideration to which a holder is so entitled shall be deemed to be such number of shares of acquiror stock plus such cash in lieu of fractional shares plus the cash portion of the exchange merger consideration. in addition, upon distribution to stockholders of any portion of the escrow indemnity funds, acquiror shall deliver to such stockholder the highest whole number of shares of acquiror stock to which such stockholder is entitled plus cash equal to the fraction of a share of acquiror stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the market price. for purposes of carrying out the intent of this section 2.1(d), acquiror may aggregate certificates so that fractional shares of acquiror stock due in exchange for multiple certificates may be combined to yield a number of whole shares thereof plus a single fraction. (e) in order to implement the indemnification provisions of section 8 hereof, the stock merger consideration payable to each stockholder pursuant to section 2.2 prior to the termination of the escrow indemnity period hereof shall be equal to the product of (i) the closing stock conversion number and (ii) the number of shares represented by certificates held by such stockholder. the remainder of such stockholder's stock merger consideration shall be held as part of the escrow indemnity funds and shall be payable to such stockholder after the escrow indemnity period in accordance with section 8 hereof and the escrow agreement. section 2.2. exchange of certificates; exchange agent and exchange procedures. (a) as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, acquiror shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by acquiror (the "exchange agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares (other than dissenting shares), for exchange in accordance with this article, through the exchange agent, (i) cash (by wire transfer of federal funds pursuant to instructions reasonably satisfactory to the exchange agent) in an amount equal to the cash merger consideration multiplied by the number of all shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to section 2.1(b) and any dissenting shares) (said number of shares less said shares to be cancelled and less said dissenting shares hereafter to be referred to as the "net shares"), and (ii) the stock merger consideration multiplied by the net shares, plus cash in an amount sufficient to make payment for fractional shares, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares, less the number of shares of acquiror stock constituting the escrow indemnity funds (collectively, the "exchange fund"). subject to article 8 hereof, the exchange agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from acquiror, deliver the exchange merger consideration to be issued pursuant to section 2.1(a) out of the exchange fund to holders of shares upon transmittal of certificates for exchange as provided therein and in section 2.2(b). the exchange fund shall not be used for any other purpose. any interest, dividends or other income earned by the exchange fund shall be for the account of acquiror. (b) as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, acquiror will instruct the exchange agent to issue (pursuant to instructions from each holder of record reasonably satisfactory to acquiror and the exchange agent, and otherwise by mail to the most recent address of such holder as shown on the company's books and records) to such holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the effective time evidenced outstanding shares (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to section 2.1(b) and any dissenting shares), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates to the exchange agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as acquiror and the company may reasonably specify) and instructions to effect the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the exchange merger consideration. upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by acquiror together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (collectively, the "transmittal documents"), the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the exchange merger consideration which such holder has the right to receive, subject to article 8 hereof, pursuant to sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(d) hereof, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the company, the exchange merger consideration may be issued and paid in accordance with this article to a transferee if the certificate evidencing such shares is presented to the exchange agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. the exchange merger consideration will be delivered by the exchange agent promptly following surrender of a certificate and the related transmittal documents, and cash payments for fractional shares and the cash portion of the exchange merger consideration may be made by check (or, pursuant to instructions reasonably satisfactory to the exchange agent, by wire transfer). no interest will be payable on the exchange merger consideration regardless of any delay in making payments. until surrendered as contemplated by this section, each certificate shall be deemed at any time after the effective time to evidence only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the exchange merger consideration, without interest. (c) in the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other conditions as acquiror reasonably may impose, the surviving corporation shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the exchange merger consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(d), subject to article 8 hereof. acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to authorizing the issuance thereof by the surviving corporation, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to provide a bond or other surety to acquiror and the surviving corporation in such sum as acquiror may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against acquiror or the surviving corporation (and their affiliates) with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(a) if at any time after the closing date and prior to the termination of this agreement, the escrow agent receives written instructions in accordance with the terms of section 2.4 hereof from acquiror to make a payment to acquiror, then the escrow agent shall make payments out of the escrow indemnity funds to acquiror, in accordance with such instructions and with section 2.4, unless the escrow indemnity funds shall be insufficient to comply with such instructions, in which case the escrow agent shall pay the entire escrow indemnity funds to acquiror and shall advise acquiror and the agent in writing of the amount of such payment. the number of shares of the escrow indemnity funds to be delivered to acquiror in connection with each payment hereunder shall be calculated by acquiror and shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the claimed amount (as defined in section 2.4) by (ii) the average closing price per share of acquiror stock for the period of 20 trading days ending three trading days prior to the date of such payment (the "market price"). the closing price for each such trading day shall be the last quoted sale price or, if not so quoted, the average of the low bid and high asked prices on the nasdaq national market system. (b) the escrow agent may make any payments out of the escrow indemnity funds that may at the time be permitted to be made under the provisions of section 2.4 below, and shall make all such payments that at the time are required to be made under such provisions or are jointly requested in writing by acquiror and the agent. any payment which would result in the disbursement of a fractional share of acquiror stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. in the event that any payment is made pursuant to this agreement, acquiror shall deliver to the escrow agent a new certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing the escrow indemnity funds less such shares disbursed in the payment and all previous payments. (c) in the event there are no unresolved claims (as hereinafter defined), on the date which is ten (10) days after the expiration of the escrow indemnity period, or the next business day if such date is not a business day, acquiror shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the escrow agent cash in lieu of fractional shares calculated in accordance with the second to last sentence of this paragraph (c) and separate certificates registered in each stockholder's name (or, in the event of a transfer of ownership of acquiror stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the company, in the name of a transferee who has presented documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid), representing such stockholder's proportionate share of the escrow indemnity funds, less such stockholder's proportionate share of all portions thereof, if any, (i) paid to acquiror pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, and (ii) which are the subject of unresolved claims (as hereinafter defined). the escrow agent shall retain the portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to all unresolved claims until resolution of such unresolved claims in accordance with the terms hereof. in the event one or more unresolved claims with respect to the escrow indemnity funds, if any, shall exist upon the expiration of the escrow indemnity period, shares of acquiror stock with a market price measured as of the date of such expiration (such number to be determined by acquiror) equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of such unresolved claims and (ii) the amount reasonably estimated by acquiror to cover the fees, expense and other costs (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) which will be required to resolve such unresolved claims shall be retained as part of the escrow indemnity funds and the balance thereof, if any, shall be distributed to the stockholders entitled thereto. upon the resolution of all such unresolved claims and the payment of all such fees, expenses and costs out of the escrow indemnity funds, the balance of the acquiror stock, if any, shall be distributed to the stockholders entitled thereto in accordance with the terms hereof. in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to this paragraph (c), each stockholder shall receive the highest whole number of shares of acquiror stock to which he or she is entitled plus cash equal to the fraction of a share of acquiror stock to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the market price of the acquiror stock determined by acquiror as of the date three days prior to the distribution of such shares. promptly after such receipt, the escrow agent will deliver such certificates together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares to each respective stockholder (or transferee) at the addresses to be supplied by acquiror in accordance with acquiror's written instructions. acquiror shall make all calculations relating to shares of acquiror stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the escrow agent shall not be responsible for determining the accuracy of any such calculation. 2.3 unresolved claims. the term "unresolved claims" shall mean any claim or request made pursuant to the merger agreement against the escrow indemnity funds in accordance with the merger agreement and section 2.4 below, until such time as such claim or request has been paid in full or otherwise fully settled, compromised or adjusted by acquiror, the agent and the escrow agent or by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction resolving such claim, from which no appeal is or can be taken. 2.4 notice of request; dispute notice. if at any time during the term of this agreement, acquiror believes that it is entitled to any portion of the escrow indemnity funds, then acquiror shall furnish to the escrow agent (with a simultaneous copy to the agent), a notice (the "indemnity notice of request") setting forth the cash amount (the "claimed amount") to which acquiror believes it is entitled and the reasons for such belief. if the escrow agent does not receive, within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the indemnity notice of request, a notice from the agent (the "indemnity dispute notice") with a simultaneous copy to acquiror that a dispute (the "indemnity dispute") exists relating to acquiror's right to that portion of the escrow indemnity funds claimed in the indemnity notice of request, the escrow agent shall, immediately after such fifteen business day period, release to acquiror the certificate then held by the escrow agent pursuant to the terms of this agreement in exchange for a new certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing a number of shares of acquiror stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the difference between, if positive, the market price of the shares of acquiror stock represented by the certificate being released calculated as of the date three trading days prior to such exchange and the claimed amount by (b) such market price, and the escrow agent shall hold such replacement certificate for acquiror stock or money pursuant to the terms of this agreement. in the event the escrow agent receives an indemnity dispute notice that an indemnity dispute exists, the escrow agent shall retain custody of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the unresolved claim until the first to occur of the following events: (a) receipt by the escrow agent of a notice ("indemnity settlement notice") signed by acquiror and the agent that the indemnity dispute has been resolved, said notice to contain instructions to escrow agent regarding delivery of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the unresolved claim; or (b) receipt by escrow agent of a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction (the "indemnity award") resolving the indemnity dispute and directing the disposition of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds; after which escrow agent shall promptly pay that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the indemnity unresolved claim in accordance with the indemnity settlement notice or the indemnity award. 2.5 maximum distributions. notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in no event shall acquiror be entitled to received shares of acquiror stock having an aggregate value of greater than $3,000,000 (calculated, in each case, based on the shares of acquiror stock being disbursed multiplied by the market price employed in connection with such disbursement). at such time as the aggregate amount paid to acquiror (calculated in accordance with the foregoing sentence) equals $3,000,000, any remaining escrow indemnity funds shall be disbursed to the stockholders and this agreement shall terminate, all in accordance with the other provisions of this agreement. article 3 escrow agent 3.1 appointment. acquiror, the company and the agent hereby appoint the escrow agent to serve hereunder and the escrow agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform all duties which are expressly set forth in this agreement. 3.2 compensation. the escrow agent shall be entitled to compensation for legal fees incurred in connection with the preparation of this agreement and for its services hereunder in accordance with the attached fee schedule, which may be subject to change hereafter on an annual basis, upon notice to acquiror and the agent. compensation of the escrow agent and all reasonable expenses of the escrow agent (including all reasonable attorneys' fees of those attorneys not regularly in its employ) in connection with the performance of its services hereunder shall be borne one half by acquiror and one half by the agent. the escrow agent shall be entitled to reimbursement on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this agreement or the escrow created hereby which are in excess of its compensation for normal services hereunder, including without limitation, payment of any reasonable legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the escrow agent in connection with the resolution of any claim in any party hereunder. 3.3 indemnification. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, acquiror and the agent will at their joint and several expense hold the escrow agent, its directors, officers and employees harmless and indemnify the escrow agent in connection with any and all third party claims, losses, judgments or costs, regardless of their nature, arising out of or because of this agreement, except such as may arise because of the escrow agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of this agreement (including, without limitation, article 2 hereof). any such expense in the preceding sentence as between acquiror and the agent shall be borne jointly and severally by acquiror and the agent. acquiror and the agent also exonerate said escrow agent from any liability in connection with this agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder, including but not limited to reasonable legal fees and other reasonable costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim or liability except such as may arise because of the escrow agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its specified duties hereunder or breach of this agreement (including, without limitation, article 2 hereof). nothing in this section 3.3 shall constitute a waiver of any claim which acquiror and the agent may have against the other for contribution arising from their joint obligations to hold the escrow agent harmless hereunder. anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the escrow agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the escrow agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. the escrow agent shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which might in its judgment involve any expense or liability unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable indemnification. 3.4 resignation;

(b) authority to execute and perform agreements. such stockholder has the full legal right and power and all authority required to enter into, execute and deliver this agreement and to perform fully such stockholder's obligations hereunder. the execution and delivery of this agreement by such stockholder have been duly authorized by all requisite organizational action, if any, on the part of such stockholder. this agreement has been duly executed and delivered and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such stockholder enforceable against such stockholder in accordance with its terms (subject to the enforceability exceptions). (c) no conflicts; consents. (i) except as set forth in section 2.1(c) of the stockholder disclosure letter, the execution and delivery by such stockholder of this agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under (a) any contract, agreement or other binding arrangement to which such stockholder is a party or (b) any judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, governmental body, administrative agency or arbitrator applicable to such stockholder. (ii) except as set forth in section 2.1(c) of the stockholder disclosure letter, no governmental authorizations or private authorizations are required to be obtained or made by such stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery by such stockholder of this agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. (d) information supplied. none of the information specifically supplied or to be supplied by such stockholder with respect to such stockholder for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement will, at the time the registration statement is filed with the sec and at the time it becomes effective under the securities act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated thereon or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the proxy statement to be delivered to all stockholders of the company (the "proxy statement") will, at the date the proxy statement is first mailed to the company's stockholders and at the time of the special meeting of company stockholders for the purpose of voting on the merger agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. (e) investigation. such stockholder has had a full opportunity to review and discuss this agreement, the escrow agreement and the merger agreement (including, without limitation, with respect to the representations and warranties in the merger agreement and the related disclosure schedule) and to ask all questions of the company and its directors and executive officers necessary in order for such stockholder to make an informed decision to enter into this agreement. (f) intent to transfer shares. such stockholder has, and as of the closing date, will have, no present plan or intention (an "intention") to sell, transfer, exchange, pledge (other than in a pre-existing bona fide margin account) or otherwise dispose of, including a distribution by a partnership to its partners, or a corporation to its shareholders, or any other transaction which results in a reduction of ownership (any of the foregoing, a "sale") of any of the shares of acquiror stock issued to such stockholder in the merger, or any securities that may be paid as a dividend otherwise distributed thereon or with respect thereto, or issued or delivered in exchange or substitution therefor or upon exercise of options held by such stockholder. for purposes of the preceding sentence, shares of acquiror stock (or the portion thereof) with respect to which a sale will occur prior to the merger shall be considered to be shares of company stock that are exchanged for acquiror stock in the merger and then disposed of pursuant to an intention. a sale of acquiror stock shall be considered to have occurred pursuant to an intention if, among other things, such sale occurs in a related transaction. subject to section 3.8, each stockholder (i) reserves the rights at any time after the closing date to evaluate his or her investment portfolio, including shares of acquiror stock and any other securities issued by acquiror, in light of new, material developments, and to make such investment decision with respect to such securities as such stockholder and his or her investment advisors, if any, shall deem to be in his or her best interests, and (ii) specifically disavows any undertaking to hold any securities issued by acquiror for any specific period. article iii covenants 3.1 no disposition or acquisition of shares. each initial stockholder agrees that, except as set forth in section 3.1 of the stockholder disclosure letter, such initial stockholder shall not sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of (except upon such stockholder's death), or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance or other disposition of, any of the shares of company stock set forth opposite his or her name on schedule a-1; provided, however, that each initial stockholder shall have the right to transfer such shares to a permitted assignee if such permitted assignee becomes a party to this agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms hereof. each initial stockholder agrees that the certificates representing the shares of company stock owned by him shall bear a legend indicating that such shares are subject to this agreement, which legend may be removed upon termination of this agreement. 3.2 voting arrangements. each of golisano and wayman agrees that, except pursuant to this agreement, he shall not grant any proxies, deposit any shares of company stock into a voting trust or enter into any voting agreement with respect to any shares of company stock now or hereafter owned, beneficially or of record, by him, other than proxies to vote such shares at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the company on matters unrelated to the matters set forth in section 4.1 hereof. 3.3 satisfaction of conditions to the merger. each of golisano and wayman agrees that each, in his capacity as a stockholder, shall assist and cooperate with the parties to the merger agreement in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws as promptly as practicable to consummate and make effective the merger and the other transactions and each of them shall not take any action that would or is reasonably likely to result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in this agreement being untrue as of the date made or in any of the conditions set forth in article 6 of the merger agreement not being satisfied. in addition, (i) acquiror, golisano and wayman agree that they will enter into, or, in the case of acquiror, cause its nominee to enter into, and, in the case of golisano and wayman, cause their affiliate which owns any property to enter into, a purchase and sale agreement relating to each property reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to acquiror, golisano and wayman, for the price of $2,200,000 for the property located at 5 fortune drive, billerica, massachusetts, $2,400,000 for the property located at 96 high street, billerica, massachusetts, and $2,700,000 for the property located at 520 metro park west, rochester, new york, and (ii) acquiror, golisano and wayman agree that they will enter into the registration rights agreement. 3.4 no solicitation. each stockholder agrees that he shall not, nor shall he permit any of such stockholder's representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by such stockholder) to, initiate, solicit or facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to an other transaction, engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide to any other person any information or data relating to, such stockholder for the purposes of, or otherwise cooperate in any way with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal to seek or effect an other transaction, or agree to or endorse any other transaction; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall prohibit any stockholder, if such stockholder is a member of board of directors of the company, from making any disclosure, in his or her capacity as a director of the company, to other stockholders of the company that, in the reasonable judgment of the company's board of directors in accordance with, and based upon the written advice of, outside counsel, is required under applicable law. each stockholder shall promptly advise acquiror of, and communicate the material terms of, any proposal such stockholder may receive, or any inquiries such stockholder receives which may reasonably be expected to lead to such a proposal relating to an other transaction, and the identity of the person making it. each stockholder shall further advise acquiror of the status and changes in the material terms of any such proposal or inquiry (or any amendment to any of them). during the term of this agreement, each stockholder agrees that he shall not enter into any agreement oral or written, and whether or not legally binding, with any person that provides for, or in any way facilitates, an other transaction, or affects any other obligation of the other stockholders under this agreement. 3.5 standstill. golisano agrees that, (i) from the date hereof until the closing date and (ii) from and after the closing date for so long as he shall be a restricted stockholder, he shall not, and shall use his best efforts to cause his affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the board of directors of acquiror, (a) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any equity securities of acquiror or any rights or options to acquire such equity securities (other than the shares of acquiror stock received by him in the merger), (b) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, a merger or other business combination involving acquiror or propose to purchase, directly or indirectly, a material portion of the assets of acquiror, (c) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in regulation 14a under the exchange act) to vote or consent or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, or granting of a consent with respect to, any voting securities of acquiror, (d) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act) for the purpose of acquiring, holding voting or disposing of any equity securities of acquiror, (e) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence in any public manner or public forum the management or policies of acquiror; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the ability to vote any shares of any equity securities of acquiror, (f) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing, (g) advise, assist (including by knowingly providing or arranging financing for that purpose) or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing or (h) take any action which might require acquiror to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a transaction between golisano and acquiror (including any of their respective affiliates). 3.6 non-competition. (a) except with the prior written consent of acquiror, for a period of five years from the closing date or the date of the closing of the offer, each of golisano and wayman shall not disclose to others or use for his or others' benefit confidential information related to the company or acquiror and its subsidiaries, including the names of customers, the contact persons at customers, pricing, the software programs utilized by the company or acquiror and its subsidiaries in the operation of its business and all other information material to the operation, management, marketing or financing of the company, acquiror and its subsidiaries which is not known or generally available to the public or competitors in the records management or records storage industries. the confidentiality obligations of this section shall not apply to information: (i) which is required to be disclosed by judicial or administrative process or order, or by other requirements of law; (ii) which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this section; (iii) which is received from a third party who obtained such information other than under an obligation of confidentiality; or (iv) which acquiror discloses on a nonconfidential basis or otherwise makes available to the general public or the trade. (b) each of golisano and wayman agrees that he shall not, for a period of five years from the closing date or from the date of the closing of the offer, directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, participate in, provide advice to, be employed by or have a financial interest in, any enterprise which provides records management or records storage services to business facilities located in any jurisdiction in which acquiror or the company operates. this section 3.6(b) shall not prohibit either golisano or wayman from acquiring up to five percent (5%) of any class of securities registered pursuant to the exchange act of any corporation which may engage in the records management storage service business in direct competition with the business of acquiror within the geographical areas set forth in this section 3.6. (c) each of golisano and wayman acknowledges that it has carefully read all the terms herein stated and agrees that the same are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the value of the company; and that each and every covenant is reasonable with respect to such matter, length of time, and the geographical areas described; and that irrespective of all other conditions, the covenants and restrictions hereinabove provided shall be operative during the full period and throughout the geographical area described. in the event any court finds any such restraint or limitation to be unreasonable, then it is the intent of the parties that such court should determine the maximum restraint or limitation which is reasonable and enforcement will be of that restraint or limitation. (d) each of golisano and wayman acknowledges that confidential information in his possession related to the company has particular value, the loss of confidentiality of which by communication to unauthorized persons cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages alone. moreover, each of golisano and wayman agrees that any breach of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 3.6 would give rise to damages which would be difficult to calculate. therefore, the parties hereby agree that in the event of a breach of any of the terms and conditions of this section 3.6, acquiror shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of an injunction. this section 3.6 shall not be construed as a limitation upon acquiror's remedies for such breach. (e) the restrictions contained in this section 3.6 shall be broadly construed by any court having jurisdiction of the matter in order to protect acquiror to the maximum degree possible. 3.7 tender offer; commitment to sell. (a) if acquiror terminates the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(d) thereof (other than a termination by acquiror pursuant to section 7.1(d)(ii)(b)(ii) unless the reason for the failure to consummate the merger prior to the termination date is due to any breach by the company of its covenants therein or the failure of the representations and warranties of the company to be true and correct in all material respects), it shall have the right, but not the obligation, to commence an offer (the "offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares at a per share purchase price (the "offer consideration") equal to the merger consideration (assuming for such purposes that the commencement of the offer would constitute a change of control under the option plans and, as a consequence thereof, there would be an acceleration of the option securities as of the date of commencement of the offer, as set forth in section 3.13(b) of the disclosure schedule). shares tendered in the offer shall be free and clear of all liens. the offer shall comply in all material respects with applicable law. (b) each of golisano and wayman hereby agrees that they will irrevocably tender their shares of company stock identified on schedule a-1 hereto in any such offer commenced by acquiror and, in connection therewith, transfer to acquiror all of the right, title and interest of each of golisano and wayman in and to such shares, free and clear of all liens. (c) all of the representations, warranties and covenants made by the company in the merger agreement shall be deemed made in connection with the offer by each stockholder who tenders shares in the offer, which representations, warranties and covenants shall survive for a period of one year after the closing of the offer. any claim for indemnification in respect of breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the merger agreement and article 5 of this agreement (except that there will be no escrow indemnity fund). (d) the closing of the offer shall take place in accordance with the instructions set forth in the offer. at such closing, (a) acquiror shall make payment of the offer consideration to each stockholder who tenders their shares in the offer in shares of acquiror stock, which shares shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and the cash portion of the exchange merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, (b) each of golisano and wayman shall deliver to buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to buyer and its counsel that all necessary authorizations, consents, orders, waivers and approvals have been obtained to vest in buyer all of the right, title and interest of the shares being transferred to buyer by them, and (c) each stockholder who tenders shares in the offer shall deliver to acquiror the certificates representing such shares duly endorsed for transfer to acquiror or with stock powers duly executed by such stockholder and otherwise in a form and at the time which complies with the terms of the offer. (e) it is the understanding of acquiror, and each of golisano and wayman hereby represents, that, in the event of an acquisition of shares of acquiror stock in the offer, each of golisano and/or wayman will be acquiring the shares of acquiror stock to be acquired by him through the offer for his own account for investment with no intention of presently distributing or reselling the same, subject, nevertheless, to his right to dispose of such shares, or any part of any thereof held by him, if at some future time in his sole discretion he deems it advisable so to do. each of golisano and wayman hereby agrees that he will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any such shares of acquiror stock in violation of the securities act, and that such shares of acquiror stock may contain a legend, reasonably satisfactory to acquiror, referring to the provisions of this section. each of golisano and wayman understands that the company is not and will not be required to file a registration statement under the securities act in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of acquiror stock which may be acquired by either golisano or wayman pursuant to the offer. (f) the undertakings in this section 3.7 shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the effective time, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with section 7.1 thereof (other than a termination which results in acquiror having the right to make the offer in accordance with this section 3.7) or (iii) six months after a termination which results in acquiror having the right to make the offer in accordance with this section 3.7 (provided that on or before thirty days after such termination acquiror shall have provided notice to golisano of its intention to commence the offer). 3.8 post-closing transfer restrictions. in the event the merger is consummated as an alternative transaction, each of the stockholders agrees that, from and after the closing date until the one-year anniversary thereof, such stockholder shall not sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of, including through any "short sale" or derivative transactions (collectively "transfer"), any shares of acquiror stock received by such stockholder as a result of the merger if, after giving effect to such transfer, the aggregate number of shares of acquiror stock received in the merger by all stockholders and not transferred would be less than a number of shares of acquiror stock having a value, as of the date of the merger, of less than fifty percent (50%) of the value of all of the formerly outstanding company stock as of the same date. for purposes of the preceding computation, shares of company stock surrendered by dissenters or exchanged for cash in lieu of fractional shares of acquiror stock will be treated as outstanding company stock on the date of the merger that has subsequently been transferred, and all shares of company stock and all shares of acquiror stock held by the stockholders and transferred prior or subsequent to the merger will be included in the computation. 3.9 [intentionally omitted.] article iv proxy; conversion; elections; waiver of rights 4.1 proxy. each of golisano and wayman hereby agrees that, at any meeting of the stockholders of the company, however called, and at every adjournment thereof, and in any action by written consent of the stockholders of the company, to (a) vote all of the shares of company stock then owned, beneficially or of record, by him in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement as in effect on the date hereof (as such agreement may be amended (1) as contemplated by section 7.3 of the merger agreement or (2) with the consent of such stockholder) and each of the other transactions contemplated thereby and any action required in furtherance thereof, (b) vote such shares against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of the company under the merger agreement, and (c) vote such shares against any other transaction or any other action or agreement that, directly or indirectly, is inconsistent with or that would, or is reasonably likely to, directly or indirectly, impede, interfere with or attempt to discourage the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, including, but not limited to (i) any extraordinary corporate transaction (other than the merger on the terms set forth in the merger agreement), such as a merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization recapitalization or liquidation involving the company, (ii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company, or (iii) any material change in the company's corporate structure or business; provided, however, that, if either golisano or wayman is a member of the board of directors of the company, nothing herein shall be construed to obligate such stockholder or representative to act in his capacity as a director in any manner which may conflict with such person's fiduciary duties as a director of the company. in furtherance of the foregoing, (i) each of golisano and wayman hereby appoints acquiror and the proper officers of acquiror, and each of them, with full power of substitution in the premises, its proxies to vote all his shares of company capital stock at any meeting, general or special, of the stockholders of the company, and to execute one or more written consents or other instruments from time to time in order to take such action without the necessity of a meeting of the stockholders of the company, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph and (ii) acquiror hereby agrees to vote such shares or execute written consents or other instruments in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. the proxy and power of attorney granted herein shall be irrevocable during the term of this agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and shall revoke all prior proxies granted by such golisano and wayman. each of golisano and wayman shall not grant any proxy to any person which conflicts with the proxy granted herein, and any attempt to do so shall be void. the power of attorney granted herein is a durable power of attorney and shall survive the disability or incompetence of such stockholder. 4.2 appraisal rights. each of golisano and wayman hereby waives his rights to appraisal under section 262 of the dgcl with respect to any shares of company stock owned by him in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. each of golisano and wayman hereby agrees that he will not in any way attempt to influence, encourage or persuade any person who beneficially owns any company stock to exercise any rights to appraisal such person may have pursuant to section 262 of the dgcl in connection with said transactions. 4.3 waiver of certain rights. each initial stockholder hereby waives and agrees not to assert any claims or rights it may have against any officer or director of the company relating to or arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time or the closing of the offer, as the case may be, including, without limitation, in respect of approval or adoption of the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated thereby. article v indemnification 5.1 indemnification in the event of the offer. each stockholder agrees that the indemnification provisions set forth in article 8 of the merger agreement shall be applicable in the event acquiror consummates the offer pursuant to section 3.7 hereof; provided, however, that only stockholders who tender shares in the offer shall be responsible for such indemnification and each such stockholder shall only be responsible for such stockholder's proportionate share of any claim. in addition, (i) the escrow indemnity period shall terminate on the first anniversary of the closing of the offer and the closing date shall be deemed to be the closing of the offer, (ii) the amount of acquiror stock received by each stockholder who tenders shares in the offer shall be adjusted to reflect the escrow to be established, and (iii) each stockholder will agree to execute the escrow agreement with such changes therein, if any, as are necessary to reflect the differences between the merger and the offer. 5.2 exclusive remedy. except as otherwise provided in article 8 and section 9.8 of the merger agreement, the indemnification provided in this article shall be the sole and exclusive post-closing remedy available to acquiror against the stockholders for any claim under this agreement. article vi miscellaneous 6.1 termination. this agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the mutual consent of acquiror and all of the stockholders, (ii) one year after the termination of the merger agreement prior to the consummation of the merger and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the closing date. 6.2 amendment. this agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by the parties or their respective successors or assigns. 6.3 notices. notices, requests, permissions, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if signed by the respective persons giving them (in the case of any corporation the signature shall be by an officer thereof) and delivered by hand, deposited in the united states mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), properly addressed and postage prepaid, or delivered by telecopy: if to acquiror, to: iron mountain incorporated 745 atlantic avenue, 10th floor boston, massachusetts 02111 telephone: (617) 357-4455 telecopy: (617) 350-7881 attention: chairman of the board with a copy to: sullivan & worcester llp one post office square boston, massachusetts 02109 telephone: (617) 338-2800 telecopy: (617) 338-2880 attention: william j. curry, esq. if to the stockholders, to: c/o b. thomas golisano 911 panorama trail south rochester, ny 14625 telephone: (716) 385-6666 telecopy: (716) 383-3428 with a copy to: woods, oviatt, gilman, sturman & clarke llp 44 exchange street rochester, ny 14614 telephone: (716) 987-2821 telecopy: (716) 454-3968 attention: harry p. messina, jr., esq. 6.4 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same original. 6.5 applicable law. this agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware without reference to choice of law principles, including all matters of construction, validity and performance. 6.6 severability; enforcement. the invalidity of any portion hereof shall not affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. if it is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, each party agrees that a court of competent jurisdiction may enforce such restriction to the maximum extent permitted by law, and each party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction. in furtherance of the foregoing, if any court construes any of the provisions of section 3.6, or any part thereof, to be unreasonable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic scope thereof, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or restrict the geographic scope of such provision and to enforce such provision as so reduced or restricted. 6.7 further assurances. each party hereto shall execute and deliver such additional documents as may be necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement. 6.8 additional stockholders; parties in interest; assignment. the parties hereto agree that, from time to time, any and all additional stockholders of the company may be added as parties hereto by (i) approving a resolution or taking such other action at the special meeting as acquiror and the company may agree upon or (ii) executing a counterpart of this agreement or an agreement by which such stockholder agrees to join and to be bound hereby, and without in either case further action by any party hereto or thereto. neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interest or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of sections 3.5 and 3.6, the term acquiror shall include any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with acquiror, any successor, by operation of law or otherwise of acquiror, or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with acquiror, and any assignee of acquiror. 6.9 entire agreement. this agreement and the merger agreement and the collateral documents contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede and cancel all prior agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and communications of the parties, oral or written, respecting such subject matter. there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, agreements or undertakings of any party hereto or to the merger agreement or any of the collateral documents with respect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the merger agreement and the collateral documents other than those set forth herein or therein or made hereunder or thereunder. 6.10 specific performance. the parties hereto agree that the remedy at law for any breach of this agreement will be inadequate and that any party by whom this agreement is enforceable shall be entitled to specific performance in addition to any other appropriate relief or remedy. such party may, in its sole discretion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this agreement or prevent any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief. 6.11 headings;

now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the agreements set forth below, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: article 1 escrow indemnity funds 1.1 delivery. upon consummation of the merger, acquiror will deliver to the escrow agent a certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing 141,836 shares of acquiror stock (the "escrow indemnity funds"). the shares of acquiror stock represented by the escrow indemnity funds shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in article xii of acquiror's by-laws. 1.2 receipt. the escrow agent agrees to hold and disburse the escrow indemnity funds (together with interest earned thereon) solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, pursuant to the written direction of acquiror, and for the uses and purposes stated herein. the escrow agent shall, upon receipt of the escrow indemnity funds, issue written acknowledgment to acquiror and the agent of receipt thereof. 1.3 rights of stockholders. (a) in the case any distribution of capital or stock dividend shall be made on or in respect of acquiror stock, or any money or property shall be distributed with respect to acquiror stock, pursuant to a recapitalization or reclassification of the capital of acquiror, or pursuant to a reorganization or liquidation or dissolution of acquiror, any such money or property to be distributed with respect to the escrow indemnity funds shall be delivered to the escrow agent to be held by it as part of the escrow indemnity funds. acquiror shall forthwith deliver to the escrow agent an additional certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing any such additional acquiror stock or such money and the escrow agent shall hold such additional acquiror stock or money pursuant to the terms of this agreement. (b) each stockholder shall be entitled to receive all ordinary cash dividends paid in respect of his or her proportionate share (as defined below) of acquiror stock that would otherwise be registered in his or her name but for such shares being a part of the escrow indemnity funds and to vote and to give consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of his or her proportionate share of acquiror stock which is part of the escrow indemnity funds. the agent shall pay over to each stockholder, forthwith upon receipt, his or her proportionate share of all ordinary cash dividends paid on the escrow indemnity funds, and, at the cost of acquiror, shall execute and deliver to each stockholder such proxies or other documents in writing as may be necessary to enable each stockholder to exercise the foregoing rights. in connection with any vote or consent by the stockholders with respect to shares of acquiror stock which are part of the escrow indemnity funds, the agent shall vote the shares of acquiror stock forming part of the escrow indemnity funds in accordance with the directions of the stockholders to the agent. in order to take such vote, the agent shall tabulate the votes it receives from the stockholders and inform acquiror in writing of the aggregate percent of all votes received for, against and in abstention with respect to each matter voted upon. acquiror shall then convert such percent to a number based on the then-existing escrow indemnity funds, rounded in each case down to the nearest whole number. the term "proportionate share", as to each stockholder, shall mean such stockholder's proportionate share of the total number of shares of aquiror stock to be issued in connection with the merger. article 2 procedures for disbursement of escrow indemnity funds 2.1 purpose. the escrow indemnity funds shall be held by the escrow agent to secure the indemnification obligations to acquiror under the merger agreement and shall be held and released in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the escrow agent agrees to hold, disburse and invest the escrow indemnity funds solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement and for the uses and purposes stated herein. 2.2 disbursement. (a) if at any time after the closing date and prior to the termination of this agreement, the escrow agent receives written instructions in accordance with the terms of section 2.4 hereof from acquiror to make a payment to acquiror, then the escrow agent shall make payments out of the escrow indemnity funds to acquiror, in accordance with such instructions and with section 2.4, unless the escrow indemnity funds shall be insufficient to comply with such instructions, in which case the escrow agent shall pay the entire escrow indemnity funds to acquiror and shall advise acquiror and the agent in writing of the amount of such payment. the number of shares of the escrow indemnity funds to be delivered to acquiror in connection with each payment hereunder shall be calculated by acquiror and shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the claimed amount (as defined in section 2.4) by (ii) the average closing price per share of acquiror stock for the period of 20 trading days ending three trading days prior to the date of such payment (the "market price"). the closing price for each such trading day shall be the last quoted sale price or, if not so quoted, the average of the low bid and high asked prices on the nasdaq national market system. (b) the escrow agent may make any payments out of the escrow indemnity funds that may at the time be permitted to be made under the provisions of section 2.4 below, and shall make all such payments that at the time are required to be made under such provisions or are jointly requested in writing by acquiror and the agent. any payment which would result in the disbursement of a fractional share of acquiror stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. in the event that any payment is made pursuant to this agreement, acquiror shall deliver to the escrow agent a new certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing the escrow indemnity funds less such shares disbursed in the payment and all previous payments. (c) in the event there are no unresolved claims (as hereinafter defined), on the date which is ten (10) days after the expiration of the escrow indemnity period, or the next business day if such date is not a business day, acquiror shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the escrow agent cash in lieu of fractional shares calculated in accordance with the second to last sentence of this paragraph (c) and separate certificates registered in each stockholder's name (or, in the event of a transfer of ownership of acquiror stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the company, in the name of a transferee who has presented documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid), representing such stockholder's proportionate share of the escrow indemnity funds, less such stockholder's proportionate share of all portions thereof, if any, (i) paid to acquiror pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, and (ii) which are the subject of unresolved claims (as hereinafter defined). the escrow agent shall retain the portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to all unresolved claims until resolution of such unresolved claims in accordance with the terms hereof. in the event one or more unresolved claims with respect to the escrow indemnity funds, if any, shall exist upon the expiration of the escrow indemnity period, shares of acquiror stock with a market price measured as of the date of such expiration (such number to be determined by acquiror) equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of such unresolved claims and (ii) the amount reasonably estimated by acquiror to cover the fees, expense and other costs (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) which will be required to resolve such unresolved claims shall be retained as part of the escrow indemnity funds and the balance thereof, if any, shall be distributed to the stockholders entitled thereto. upon the resolution of all such unresolved claims and the payment of all such fees, expenses and costs out of the escrow indemnity funds, the balance of the acquiror stock, if any, shall be distributed to the stockholders entitled thereto in accordance with the terms hereof. in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to this paragraph (c), each stockholder shall receive the highest whole number of shares of acquiror stock to which he or she is entitled plus cash equal to the fraction of a share of acquiror stock to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the market price of the acquiror stock determined by acquiror as of the date three days prior to the distribution of such shares. promptly after such receipt, the escrow agent will deliver such certificates together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares to each respective stockholder (or transferee) at the addresses to be supplied by acquiror in accordance with acquiror's written instructions. acquiror shall make all calculations relating to shares of acquiror stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the escrow agent shall not be responsible for determining the accuracy of any such calculation. 2.3 unresolved claims. the term "unresolved claims" shall mean any claim or request made pursuant to the merger agreement against the escrow indemnity funds in accordance with the merger agreement and section 2.4 below, until such time as such claim or request has been paid in full or otherwise fully settled, compromised or adjusted by acquiror, the agent and the escrow agent or by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction resolving such claim, from which no appeal is or can be taken. 2.4 notice of request; dispute notice. if at any time during the term of this agreement, acquiror believes that it is entitled to any portion of the escrow indemnity funds, then acquiror shall furnish to the escrow agent (with a simultaneous copy to the agent), a notice (the "indemnity notice of request") setting forth the cash amount (the "claimed amount") to which acquiror believes it is entitled and the reasons for such belief. if the escrow agent does not receive, within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the indemnity notice of request, a notice from the agent (the "indemnity dispute notice") with a simultaneous copy to acquiror that a dispute (the "indemnity dispute") exists relating to acquiror's right to that portion of the escrow indemnity funds claimed in the indemnity notice of request, the escrow agent shall, immediately after such fifteen business day period, release to acquiror the certificate then held by the escrow agent pursuant to the terms of this agreement in exchange for a new certificate registered in the name of james b. wayman, jr., as agent, representing a number of shares of acquiror stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the difference between, if positive, the market price of the shares of acquiror stock represented by the certificate being released calculated as of the date three trading days prior to such exchange and the claimed amount by (b) such market price, and the escrow agent shall hold such replacement certificate for acquiror stock or money pursuant to the terms of this agreement. in the event the escrow agent receives an indemnity dispute notice that an indemnity dispute exists, the escrow agent shall retain custody of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the unresolved claim until the first to occur of the following events: (a) receipt by the escrow agent of a notice ("indemnity settlement notice") signed by acquiror and the agent that the indemnity dispute has been resolved, said notice to contain instructions to escrow agent regarding delivery of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the unresolved claim; or (b) receipt by escrow agent of a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction (the "indemnity award") resolving the indemnity dispute and directing the disposition of that portion of the escrow indemnity funds; after which escrow agent shall promptly pay that portion of the escrow indemnity funds which relates to the indemnity unresolved claim in accordance with the indemnity settlement notice or the indemnity award. 2.5 maximum distributions. notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in no event shall acquiror be entitled to received shares of acquiror stock having an aggregate value of greater than $3,000,000 (calculated, in each case, based on the shares of acquiror stock being disbursed multiplied by the market price employed in connection with such disbursement). at such time as the aggregate amount paid to acquiror (calculated in accordance with the foregoing sentence) equals $3,000,000, any remaining escrow indemnity funds shall be disbursed to the stockholders and this agreement shall terminate, all in accordance with the other provisions of this agreement. article 3 escrow agent 3.1 appointment. acquiror, the company and the agent hereby appoint the escrow agent to serve hereunder and the escrow agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform all duties which are expressly set forth in this agreement. 3.2 compensation. the escrow agent shall be entitled to compensation for legal fees incurred in connection with the preparation of this agreement and for its services hereunder in accordance with the attached fee schedule, which may be subject to change hereafter on an annual basis, upon notice to acquiror and the agent. compensation of the escrow agent and all reasonable expenses of the escrow agent (including all reasonable attorneys' fees of those attorneys not regularly in its employ) in connection with the performance of its services hereunder shall be borne one half by acquiror and one half by the agent. the escrow agent shall be entitled to reimbursement on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this agreement or the escrow created hereby which are in excess of its compensation for normal services hereunder, including without limitation, payment of any reasonable legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the escrow agent in connection with the resolution of any claim in any party hereunder. 3.3 indemnification. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, acquiror and the agent will at their joint and several expense hold the escrow agent, its directors, officers and employees harmless and indemnify the escrow agent in connection with any and all third party claims, losses, judgments or costs, regardless of their nature, arising out of or because of this agreement, except such as may arise because of the escrow agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of this agreement (including, without limitation, article 2 hereof). any such expense in the preceding sentence as between acquiror and the agent shall be borne jointly and severally by acquiror and the agent. acquiror and the agent also exonerate said escrow agent from any liability in connection with this agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder, including but not limited to reasonable legal fees and other reasonable costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim or liability except such as may arise because of the escrow agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its specified duties hereunder or breach of this agreement (including, without limitation, article 2 hereof). nothing in this section 3.3 shall constitute a waiver of any claim which acquiror and the agent may have against the other for contribution arising from their joint obligations to hold the escrow agent harmless hereunder. anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the escrow agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the escrow agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. the escrow agent shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which might in its judgment involve any expense or liability unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable indemnification. 3.4 resignation; removal. the escrow agent may resign at any time upon giving the parties hereto 30 days' prior written notice. acquiror and the agent may also, at any time, mutually agree in a writing signed by acquiror and the agent to remove the escrow agent upon 30 days' prior written notice. in either event, the successor escrow agent shall be such person, firm or corporation as shall be mutually selected by acquiror and the agent. it is understood and agreed that such resignation or removal shall not be effective until a successor agrees to act hereunder by signing a copy hereof; provided, however, if no successor is appointed and acting hereunder within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, the escrow agent may pay and deliver the escrow indemnity funds into a court of competent jurisdiction. article 4 liabilities of escrow agent 4.1 limitations. (a) the escrow agent shall be liable only to accept, hold and deliver the escrow indemnity funds in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and any amendments hereto or other written instructions executed by acquiror and the agent; provided, however, that the escrow agent shall not incur any liability with respect to (a) any action taken or omitted in good faith and with due care upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, including in-house counsel, given with respect to any questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the escrow agent under this agreement, or (b) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument which the escrow agent shall in good faith and with due care believe to be genuine (including the execution of such instrument, the identity or authority of any person executing such instrument, its validity and effectiveness, and the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein), to have been signed by a proper person or persons and to conform to the provisions of this agreement.
