(3) the board may issue options, warrants or convertible securities or securities of similar nature conferring the right upon the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or receive any class of shares or securities in the capital of the company on such terms as it may from time to time determine. 13. the company may in connection with the issue of any shares exercise all powers of paying commission and brokerage conferred or permitted by the law. subject to the law, the commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or by the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one and partly in the other. 14. except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share upon any trust and the company shall not be bound by or required in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or any fractional part of a share or (except only as otherwise provided by these articles or by law) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 15. subject to the law and these articles, the board may at any time after the allotment of shares but before any person has been entered in the register as the holder, recognise a renunciation thereof by the allottee in favour of some other person and may accord to any allottee of a share a right to effect such renunciation upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the board considers fit to impose. share certificates 16. every share certificate shall be issued under the seal or a facsimile thereof or with the seal printed thereon and shall specify the number and class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates, and the amount paid up thereon and may otherwise be in such form as the directors may from time to time determine. no certificate shall be issued representing shares of more than one class. the board may by resolution determine, either generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures on any such certificates (or certificates in respect of other securities) need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificates by some mechanical means or may be printed thereon. - 8 - 17. (1) in the case of a share held jointly by several persons, the company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate therefor and delivery of a certificate to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders. (2) where a share stands in the names of two or more persons, the person first named in the register shall as regards service of notices and, subject to the provisions of these articles, all or any other matters connected with the company, except the transfer of the shares, be deemed the sole holder thereof. 18. every person whose name is entered, upon an allotment of shares, as a member in the register shall be entitled, without payment, to receive one certificate for all such shares of any one class or several certificates each for one or more of such shares of such class upon payment for every certificate after the first of such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses as the board from time to time determines. 19. share certificates shall be issued within the relevant time limit as prescribed by the law or as the designated stock exchange may from time to time determine, whichever is the shorter, after allotment or, except in the case of a transfer which the company is for the time being entitled to refuse to register and does not register, after lodgment of a transfer with the company. 20. (1) upon every transfer of shares the certificate held by the transferor shall be given up to be cancelled, and shall forthwith be cancelled accordingly, and a new certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect of the shares transferred to him at such fee as is provided in paragraph (2) of this article. if any of the shares included in the certificate so given up shall be retained by the transferor a new certificate for the balance shall be issued to him at the aforesaid fee payable by the transferor to the company in respect thereof. (2) the fee referred to in paragraph (1) above shall be an amount not exceeding the relevant maximum amount as the designated stock exchange may from time to time determine provided that the board may at any time determine a lower amount for such fee. 21. if a share certificate shall be damaged or defaced or alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed a new certificate representing the same shares may be issued to the relevant member upon request and on payment of such fee as the company may determine and, subject to compliance with such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and to payment of the costs and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity as the board may think fit and, in case of damage or defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the company provided always that where share warrants have been issued, no new share warrant shall be issued to replace one that has been lost unless the board has determined that the original has been destroyed. lien 22. the company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share. the company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) registered in the name of a member (whether or - 9 - not jointly with other members) for all amounts of money presently payable by such member or his estate to the company whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the company of any equitable or other interest of any person other than such member, and whether the period for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such member or his estate and any other person, whether a member or not. the company&#146;s lien on a share shall extend to all dividends or other moneys payable thereon or in respect thereof. the board may at any time, generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any share exempt in whole or in part, from the provisions of this article. 23. subject to these articles, the company may sell in such manner as the board determines any share on which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, or the liability or engagement in respect of which such lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or discharged nor until the expiration of fourteen (14) clear days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently payable, or specifying the liability or engagement and demanding fulfilment or discharge thereof and giving notice of the intention to sell in default, has been served on the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy. 24. the net proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in or towards payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists, so far as the same is presently payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the share at the time of the sale. to give effect to any such sale the board may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares so transferred and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. calls on shares 25. subject to these articles and to the terms of allotment, the board may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium), and each member shall (subject to being given at least fourteen (14) clear days&#146; notice specifying the time and place of payment) pay to the company as required by such notice the amount called on his shares. a call may be extended, postponed or revoked in whole or in part as the board determines but no member shall be entitled to any such extension, postponement or revocation except as a matter of grace and favour. 26. a call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the board authorising the call was passed and may be made payable either in one lump sum or by instalments. 27. a person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was - 10 - made. the joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and instalments due in respect thereof or other moneys due in respect thereof. 28. if a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per cent. (20%) per annum) as the board may determine, but the board may in its absolute discretion waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 29. no member shall be entitled to receive any dividend or bonus or to be present and vote (save as proxy for another member) at any general meeting either personally or by proxy, or be reckoned in a quorum, or exercise any other privilege as a member until all calls or instalments due by him to the company, whether alone or jointly with any other person, together with interest and expenses (if any) shall have been paid. 30. on the trial or hearing of any action or other proceedings for the recovery of any money due for any call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the member sued is entered in the register as the holder, or one of the holders, of the shares in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute book, and that notice of such call was duly given to the member sued, in pursuance of these articles; and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment of the directors who made such call, nor any other matters whatsoever, but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt. 31. any amount payable in respect of a share upon allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date fixed for payment and if it is not paid the provisions of these articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 32. on the issue of shares the board may differentiate between the allottees or holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment. 33. the board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same, and either in money or money&#146;s worth, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid or instalments payable upon any shares held by him and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced (until the same would, but for such advance, become presently payable) pay interest at such rate (if any) as the board may decide. the board may at any time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such member not less than one (1) month&#146;s notice of its intention in that behalf, unless before the expiration of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been called up on the shares in respect of which it was advanced. such payment in advance shall not entitle the holder of such share or shares to participate in respect thereof in a dividend subsequently declared. forfeiture of shares 34. (1) if a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the board may give to the person from whom it is due not less than fourteen (14) clear days&#146; notice: - 11 - (a) requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and which may still accrue up to the date of actual payment; and (b) stating that if the notice is not complied with the shares on which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. (2) if the requirements of any such notice are not complied with, any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before payment of all calls and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the board to that effect, and such forfeiture shall include all dividends and bonuses declared in respect of the forfeited share but not actually paid before the forfeiture. 35. when any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the share. no forfeiture shall be invalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice. 36. the board may accept the surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references in these articles to forfeiture will include surrender. 37. any share so forfeited shall be deemed the property of the company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of to such person, upon such terms and in such manner as the board determines, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be annulled by the board on such terms as the board determines. 38. a person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares but nevertheless shall remain liable to pay the company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the company in respect of the shares, with (if the directors shall in their discretion so require) interest thereon from the date of forfeiture until payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per cent. (20%) per annum) as the board determines. the board may enforce payment thereof if it thinks fit, and without any deduction or allowance for the value of the forfeited shares, at the date of forfeiture, but his liability shall cease if and when the company shall have received payment in full of all such moneys in respect of the shares. for the purposes of this article any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, is payable thereon at a fixed time which is subsequent to the date of forfeiture, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall notwithstanding that time has not yet arrived be deemed to be payable at the date of forfeiture, and the same shall become due and payable immediately upon the forfeiture, but interest thereon shall only be payable in respect of any period between the said fixed time and the date of actual payment. 39. a declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and such declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer by the company if necessary) constitute a good title to the share, and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the consideration (if any), nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share. when any share shall have been forfeited, notice of - 12 - the declaration shall be given to the member in whose name it stood immediately prior to the forfeiture, and an entry of the forfeiture, with the date thereof, shall forthwith be made in the register, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice or make any such entry. 40. notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid the board may at any time, before any shares so forfeited shall have been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, permit the shares forfeited to be bought back upon the terms of payment of all calls and interest due upon and expenses incurred in respect of the share, and upon such further terms (if any) as it thinks fit. 41. the forfeiture of a share shall not prejudice the right of the company to any call already made or instalment payable thereon. 42. the provisions of these articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. register of members 43. (1) the company shall keep in one or more books a register of its members and shall enter therein the following particulars, that is to say: (a) the name and address of each member, the number and class of shares held by him and the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on such shares; (b) the date on which each person was entered in the register; and (c) the date on which any person ceased to be a member. (2) the company may keep an overseas or local or other branch register of members resident in any place, and the board may make and vary such regulations as it determines in respect of the keeping of any such register and maintaining a registration office in connection therewith. 44. the register and branch register of members, as the case may be, shall be open to inspection for such times and on such days as the board shall determine by members without charge or by any other person, upon a maximum payment of $2.50 or such other sum specified by the board, at the office or such other place at which the register is kept in accordance with the law or, if appropriate, upon a maximum payment of $1.00 or such other sum specified by the board at the registration office. the register including any overseas or local or other branch register of members may, after notice has been given by advertisement in an appointed newspaper or any other newspapers in accordance with the requirements of the designated stock exchange or by any electronic means in such manner as may be accepted by the designated stock exchange to that effect, be closed at such times or for such periods not exceeding in the whole thirty (30) days in each year as the board may determine and either generally or in respect of any class of shares. - 13 - record dates 45. (1) for the purpose of determining the members entitled to notice of or to vote at any general meeting, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of shares or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of members, which date shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other such action. (2) if the board does not fix a record date for any general meeting, the record date for determining the members entitled to a notice of or to vote at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if in accordance with these articles notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. if corporate action without a general meeting is to be taken, the record date for determining the members entitled to express consent to such corporate action in writing, when no prior action by the board is necessary, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the company by delivery to its head office. the record date for determining the members for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating thereto. (3) a determination of the members of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. transfer of shares 46. subject to these articles, any member may transfer all or any of his shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in a form prescribed by the designated stock exchange or in any other form approved by the board and may be under hand or, if the transferor or transferee is a clearing house or its nominee(s), by hand or by machine imprinted signature or by such other manner of execution as the board may approve from time to time. 47. the instrument of transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferee provided that the board may dispense with the execution of the instrument of transfer by the transferee in any case which it thinks fit in its discretion to do so. without prejudice to the last preceding article, the board may also resolve, either generally or in any particular case, upon request by either the transferor or transferee, to accept mechanically executed transfers. the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect thereof. nothing in these articles shall preclude the board from recognising a renunciation of the allotment or provisional allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person. - 14 - 48. (1) the board may, in its absolute discretion, and without giving any reason therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any share (not being a fully paid up share) to a person of whom it does not approve, or any share issued under any share incentive scheme for employees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists, and it may also, without prejudice to the foregoing generality, refuse to register a transfer of any share to more than four joint holders or a transfer of any share (not being a fully paid up share) on which the company has a lien. (2) the board in so far as permitted by any applicable law may, in its absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time transfer any share upon the register to any branch register or any share on any branch register to the register or any other branch register. in the event of any such transfer, the shareholder requesting such transfer shall bear the cost of effecting the transfer unless the board otherwise determines. (3) unless the board otherwise agrees (which agreement may be on such terms and subject to such conditions as the board in its absolute discretion may from time to time determine, and which agreement the board shall, without giving any reason therefor, be entitled in its absolute discretion to give or withhold), no shares upon the register shall be transferred to any branch register nor shall shares on any branch register be transferred to the register or any other branch register and all transfers and other documents of title shall be lodged for registration, and registered, in the case of any shares on a branch register, at the relevant registration office, and, in the case of any shares on the register, at the office or such other place at which the register is kept in accordance with the law. 49. without limiting the generality of the last preceding article, the board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless:- (a) a fee of such maximum sum as the designated stock exchange may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as the board may from time to time require is paid to the company in respect thereof; (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; (c) the instrument of transfer is lodged at the office or such other place at which the register is kept in accordance with the law or the registration office (as the case may be) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do); and (d) if applicable, the instrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped. 50. if the board refuses to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the company, send to each of the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal. 51. the registration of transfers of shares or of any class of shares may, after notice has been given by advertisement in any newspapers or by any other means in accordance with the requirements of the designated stock exchange to that effect be - 15 - suspended at such times and for such periods (not exceeding in the whole thirty (30) days in any year) as the board may determine. transmission of shares 52. if a member dies, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, and his legal personal representatives where he was a sole or only surviving holder, will be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing in this article will release the estate of a deceased member (whether sole or joint) from any liability in respect of any share which had been solely or jointly held by him. 53. any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a member may, upon such evidence as to his title being produced as may be required by the board, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof. if he elects to become the holder he shall notify the company in writing either at the registration office or office, as the case may be, to that effect. if he elects to have another person registered he shall execute a transfer of the share in favour of that person. the provisions of these articles relating to the transfer and registration of transfers of shares shall apply to such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by such member. 54. a person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a member shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share. however, the board may, if it thinks fit, withhold the payment of any dividend payable or other advantages in respect of such share until such person shall become the registered holder of the share or shall have effectually transferred such share, but, subject to the requirements of article 75(2) being met, such a person may vote at meetings. untraceable members 55. (1) without prejudice to the rights of the company under paragraph (2) of this article, the company may cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants by post if such cheques or warrants have been left uncashed on two consecutive occasions. however, the company may exercise the power to cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants after the first occasion on which such a cheque or warrant is returned undelivered. (2) the company shall have the power to sell, in such manner as the board thinks fit, any shares of a member who is untraceable, but no such sale shall be made unless: (a) all cheques or warrants in respect of dividends of the shares in question, being not less than three in total number, for any sum payable in cash to the holder of such shares in respect of them sent during the relevant period in the manner authorised by the articles have remained uncashed; - 16 - (b) so far as it is aware at the end of the relevant period, the company has not at any time during the relevant period received any indication of the existence of the member who is the holder of such shares or of a person entitled to such shares by death, bankruptcy or operation of law; and (c) the company, if so required by the rules governing the listing of shares on the designated stock exchange, has given notice to, and caused advertisement in newspapers to be made in accordance with the requirements of, the designated stock exchange of its intention to sell such shares in the manner required by the designated stock exchange, and a period of three (3) months or such shorter period as may be allowed by the designated stock exchange has elapsed since the date of such advertisement. for the purpose of the foregoing, the &#147;relevant period&#148; means the period commencing twelve (12) years before the date of publication of the advertisement referred to in paragraph (c) of this article and ending at the expiry of the period referred to in that paragraph. (3) to give effect to any such sale the board may authorise some person to transfer the said shares and an instrument of transfer signed or otherwise executed by or on behalf of such person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the registered holder or the person entitled by transmission to such shares, and the purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. the net proceeds of the sale will belong to the company and upon receipt by the company of such net proceeds it shall become indebted to the former member for an amount equal to such net proceeds. no trust shall be created in respect of such debt and no interest shall be payable in respect of it and the company shall not be required to account for any money earned from the net proceeds which may be employed in the business of the company or as it thinks fit. any sale under this article shall be valid and effective notwithstanding that the member holding the shares sold is dead, bankrupt or otherwise under any legal disability or incapacity. general meetings 56. an annual general meeting of the company shall be held in each year other than the year of the company&#146;s incorporation at such time and place as may be determined by the board. 57. each general meeting, other than an annual general meeting, shall be called an extraordinary general meeting. general meetings may be held at such times and in any location in the world as may be determined by the board. 58. only a majority of the board or the chairman of the board may call extraordinary general meetings, which extraordinary general meetings shall be held at such times and locations (as permitted hereby) as such person or persons shall determine. - 17 - notice of general meetings 59. (1) an annual general meeting and any extraordinary general meeting may be called by not less than five (5) clear days&#146; notice but a general meeting may be called by shorter notice, subject to the law, if it is so agreed: (a) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all the members entitled to attend and vote thereat; and (b) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the members having the right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five per cent. (95%) in nominal value of the issued shares giving that right. (2) the notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting and, in case of special business, the general nature of the business. the notice convening an annual general meeting shall specify the meeting as such. notice of every general meeting shall be given to all members other than to such members as, under the provisions of these articles or the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive such notices from the company, to all persons entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a member and to each of the directors and the auditors. 60. the accidental omission to give notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the notice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at that meeting. proceedings at general meetings 61. (1) all business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting, and also all business that is transacted at an annual general meeting, with the exception of: (a) the declaration and sanctioning of dividends; (b) consideration and adoption of the accounts and balance sheet and the reports of the directors and auditors and other documents required to be annexed to the balance sheet; (c) the election of directors; (d) appointment of auditors (where special notice of the intention for such appointment is not required by the law) and other officers; (e) the fixing of the remuneration of the auditors, and the voting of remuneration or extra remuneration to the directors; - 18 - (f) the granting of any mandate or authority to the directors to offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of the unissued shares in the capital of the company representing not more than twenty per cent.

and (d) if, upon the exercise of the subscription rights represented by any warrant, the amount standing to the credit of the subscription rights reserve is not sufficient to pay up in full such additional nominal amount of shares equal to such difference as aforesaid to which the exercising warrantholder is entitled, the board shall apply any profits or reserves then or thereafter becoming available (including, to the extent permitted by law, share premium account) for such purpose until such additional nominal amount of shares is paid up and allotted as aforesaid and until then no dividend or other distribution shall be paid or made on the fully paid shares of the company then in issue. pending such payment and allotment, the exercising warrantholder shall be issued by the company with a certificate evidencing his right to the allotment of such additional nominal amount of shares. the rights represented by any such certificate shall be in registered form and shall be transferable in whole or in part in units of one share in the like manner as the shares for the time being are transferable, and the company shall make such arrangements in relation to the maintenance of a register therefor and other matters in relation thereto as the - 44 - board may think fit and adequate particulars thereof shall be made known to each relevant exercising warrantholder upon the issue of such certificate.

company has the necessary corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the transaction documents. the execution and delivery of the transaction documents by the company and the performance by the company of its obligations thereunder will not violate the memorandum or articles of association of the company amended and restated memorandum and articles of association nor any applicable law, regulation, order or decree in the cayman islands. 3. the company has taken all corporate action required to authorise its execution, delivery and performance of the transaction documents. the transaction documents have been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the company, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the company in accordance

thereof is required to authorise or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance and enforcement of the documents, except such as have been duly obtained in accordance with cayman islands law. 5. based solely on the review of the minutes, the authorised share capital of the company on the consummation of the company&#146;s ipo shall be us$900,000 divided into 8,000,000,000 ordinary shares of par value of us$0.0001 each and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares of par value of us$0.0001. the ordinary shares of the company will have the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions set forth in the company&#146;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 6. the purchased shares (as defined in the subscription agreement) to be issued and sold by the company under the subscription agreement have been duly authorised and when issued by the company in accordance with the terms of the subscription agreement against payment in full of the consideration thereof set forth in the subscription agreement and the appropriate entries made on the register of members of the company, the purchased shares will be validly issued and allotted as fully paid and non-assessable (meaning that no further sums are payable to the company on such shares) and will not be subject to any pre-emptive or similar rights under cayman islands companies law or the company&#146;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 7. the secondary shares (as defined in the shares purchase agreement) have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (meaning that no further sums are payable to the company on such shares) and the secondary shares are not subject to any pre-emptive or similar rights under cayman islands companies law or the company&#146;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 8. the register of members of the company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein and a member registered in the register of members will be deemed, as a matter of cayman islands law, to have prima facie legal title to those purchased shares and secondary shares (as defined in the purchase agreement) as set against its name in the register of members. 9. the form of share certificate used to evidence the purchased shares and secondary shares is admissible in evidence as proof of the title of that member to the shares set out therein. 10. it is not necessary or desirable to ensure the enforceability in the cayman islands of the documents that they be registered in any register kept by, or filed with, any governmental authority or regulatory body in the cayman islands. however, to the extent that any of the documents creates a charge over assets of the company, the company and its directors are under an obligation to enter such charge in the register of mortgages and charges of the company in accordance with section 54 of the companies law. while there is no exhaustive definition of a charge under cayman islands law, a charge normally has the following characteristics: (i) it is a proprietary interest granted by way of security which entitles the chargee to resort to the charged property only for the purposes of satisfying some liability due to the chargee (whether from the chargor or a third party); and (ii) the chargor retains an equity of redemption to have the property restored to him when the liability has been discharged. however, as the documents are governed by the foreign laws, the question of whether they would possess these particular characteristics would be determined under the foreign laws. 11. the documents will be subject to nominal stamp duty if they are executed in or brought into the cayman islands but will otherwise not be subject to stamp duty. 12. the choice of the foreign laws as the governing law of the documents is a valid choice of law and would be recognised and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the cayman islands, except for those laws (i) which such court considers to be procedural in nature, (ii) which are revenue or penal laws or (iii) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of the cayman islands. 13. foreign arbitration awards may be enforced in the cayman islands under the foreign arbitral awards enforcement law, which applies where the arbitration award to be enforced (the &#147; award &#148;) was made in pursuance of an arbitration agreement in a state which is a party to the new york convention on the recognition of enforcement of foreign arbitral awards adopted by the 1958 united nations conference on international commercial arbitration (the &#147; convention &#148;). in general, the courts of the cayman islands will enforce an award made under the convention unless it is proved by the party against whom the award was made that: (i) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity; (ii) the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or, in default, under the law of the jurisdiction where the award was made; (iii) the award was made in circumstances contrary to natural justice; (iv) the award dealt with a matter or matters not contemplated by or falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of such submission; or (v) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, in default of such agreement, with the laws of the jurisdiction where the arbitration took place. enforcement of an award made under the convention may also be refused by the courts of the cayman islands where the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration or where it would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands to enforce such an award. a foreign arbitration award may also be enforced in the cayman islands pursuant to common law principles by action on the award or pursuant to the arbitration law by leave of the cayman islands court. 14. the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association are consistent and in compliance with the companies law and do not conflict with any other applicable law, regulation, order or decree currently in force in the cayman islands. yours faithfully conyers dill &#038; pearman ex-99.b 3 c99025exv99wb.htm exhibit b exhibit b

(e) may not be given effect by a cayman islands court to the extent that they are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the cayman islands and such performance would be illegal under the laws of that jurisdiction. notwithstanding any contractual submission to the jurisdiction of specific courts, a cayman islands court has inherent discretion to stay or allow proceedings in the cayman islands against each of the companies under the shares purchase agreement if there are other proceedings in respect of those shares purchase agreement simultaneously underway against each of the companies in another jurisdiction. under cayman islands law, a person who is not one of the parties to an agreement is, in general, unable to enforce it. we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of the shares purchase agreement which provides for the payment of a specified rate of interest on the amount of a judgment after the date of judgement. we express no opinion in respect of the enforceability of any provision in the shares purchase agreement which purports to fetter the statutory powers of each of the companies. we have made no investigation of and express no opinion in relation to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the cayman islands. this opinion is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the cayman islands and is limited to and is given on the basis of the current law and practice in the cayman islands. this opinion is issued solely for your benefit and is not to be relied upon by any other person, firm or entity or in respect of any other matter. on the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1. as at the certificate dates, each of the companies is duly incorporated and existing under the laws of the cayman islands in good standing (meaning solely that it has not failed to make any filing with any cayman islands government authority or to pay any cayman islands government fee which would make it liable to be struck off by the registrar of companies and thereby cease to exist under the laws of the cayman islands). 2. each of the companies has the necessary corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the shares purchase agreement. the execution and delivery of the shares purchase agreement by each of the companies and the performance by each of the companies of its obligations thereunder will not violate the memorandum or articles of association of each of the companies nor any applicable law, regulation, order or decree in the cayman islands. 3. each of the companies has taken all corporate action required to authorise its execution, delivery and performance of the shares purchase agreement. the shares purchase agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of each of the companies, and constitutes the valid and binding obligations of each of the companies in accordance with the terms thereof. 4. no order, consent, approval, licence, authorisation or validation of or exemption by any government or public body or authority of the cayman islands or any sub-division thereof is required to authorise or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance and enforcement of the shares purchase agreement, except such as have been duly obtained in accordance with cayman islands law. 5. it is not necessary or desirable to ensure the enforceability in the cayman islands of the shares purchase agreement that it be registered in any register kept by, or filed with, any governmental authority or regulatory body in the cayman islands. however, to the extent that the shares purchase agreement creates a charge over assets of each of the companies, each of the companies and its directors are under an obligation to enter such charge in the register of mortgages and charges of each of the companies in accordance with section 54 of the companies law. while there is no exhaustive definition of a charge under cayman islands law, a charge normally has the following characteristics: (i) it is a proprietary interest granted by way of security which entitles the chargee to resort to the charged property only for the purposes of satisfying some liability due to the chargee (whether from the chargor or a third party); and (ii) the chargor retains an equity of redemption to have the property restored to him when the liability has been discharged. however, as the shares purchase agreement is governed by the foreign laws, the question of whether they would possess these particular characteristics would be determined under the foreign laws. 6. the shares purchase agreement will be subject to nominal stamp duty if it is executed in or brought into the cayman islands but will otherwise not be subject to stamp duty. 7. the choice of the foreign laws as the governing law of the shares purchase agreement is a valid choice of law and would be recognised and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the cayman islands, except for those laws (i) which such court considers to be procedural in nature, (ii) which are revenue or penal laws or (iii) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of the cayman islands. 8. foreign arbitration awards may be enforced in the cayman islands under the foreign arbitral awards enforcement law, which applies where the arbitration award to be enforced (the &#147; award &#148;) was made in pursuance of an arbitration agreement in a state which is a party to the new york convention on the recognition of enforcement of foreign arbitral awards adopted by the 1958 united nations conference on international commercial arbitration (the &#147; convention &#148;). in general, the courts of the cayman islands will enforce an award made under the convention unless it is proved by the party against whom the award was made that: (i) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity; (ii) the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or, in default, under the law of the jurisdiction where the award was made; (iii) the award was made in circumstances contrary to natural justice; (iv) the award dealt with a matter or matters not contemplated by or falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of such submission; or (v) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, in default of such agreement, with the laws of the jurisdiction where the arbitration took place. enforcement of an award made under the convention may also be refused by the courts of the cayman islands where the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration or where it would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands to enforce such an award. a foreign arbitration award may also be enforced in the cayman islands pursuant to common law principles by action on the award or pursuant to the arbitration law by leave of the cayman islands court. yours faithfully conyers dill &#038;

(the &#147; purchaser &#148;). for the purposes of giving this opinion, we have examined a copy of a shares purchase agreement (the &#147; shares purchase agreement &#148;) made as of &#091; &#149; &#093; march, 2010 by and among the purchaser as investor and each of the companies as selling shareholders (which term does not include any other instrument or agreement whether or not specifically referred to therein or attached as an exhibit or schedule thereto). we have also reviewed the memorandum of association and the articles of association of each of the companies, as obtained from the registrar of corporate affairs on &#091;

and (j) that on the date of entering into the shares purchase agreement each of the companies is and after entering into the shares purchase agreement will be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. the obligations of each of the companies under the shares purchase agreement (a) will be subject to the laws from time to time in effect relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, possessory liens, rights of set off, reorganisation, merger, consolidation, moratorium or any other laws or legal procedures, whether of a similar nature or otherwise, generally affecting the rights of creditors;

and (e) may not be given effect by a british virgin islands court to the extent that they are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the british virgin islands and such performance would be illegal under the laws of that jurisdiction. notwithstanding any contractual submission to the jurisdiction of specific courts, a british virgin islands court has inherent discretion to stay or allow proceedings in the british virgin islands courts. we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of the shares purchase agreement which provides for the payment of a specified rate of interest on the amount of a judgment after the date of judgment or which purports to fetter the statutory powers of each of the companies. we have made no investigation of and express no opinion in relation to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the british virgin islands. this opinion is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the british virgin islands and is limited to and is given on the basis of the current law and practice in the british virgin islands. this opinion is issued solely for your benefit and is not to be relied upon by any other person, firm or entity or in respect of any other matter. on the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1. each of the companies is duly incorporated and existing under the laws of the british virgin islands. 2. each of the companies has the necessary corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the shares purchase agreement. the execution and delivery of the shares purchase agreement by each of the companies and the performance by each of the companies of its obligations thereunder will not violate the respective memorandum of association or articles of association of each of the companies nor any applicable law, regulation, order or decree in the british virgin islands. 3. each of the companies has taken all corporate action required to authorise its execution, delivery and performance of the shares purchase agreement. the shares purchase agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of each of the companies, and constitutes the valid and binding obligations of each of the companies in accordance with the terms thereof. 4. no order, consent, approval, licence, authorisation or validation of or exemption by any government or public body or authority of the british virgin islands or any sub-division thereof is required to authorise or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance and enforcement of the shares purchase agreement, except such as have been duly obtained in accordance with british virgin islands law. 5. except as set out in this paragraph, it is not necessary or desirable to ensure the enforceability in the british virgin islands of the shares purchase agreement that it be registered in any register kept by, or filed with, any governmental authority or regulatory body in the british virgin islands. each of the companies is required to keep a register of all charges &#091;created on or after the date that each of the companies re-registered as a bvi business company under the bvi business companies act, 2004&#093; (&#147; relevant charges &#148;). to the extent that the shares purchase agreement creates a relevant charge over assets of each of the companies, particulars of the charge must be entered in the register and a copy of the register shall be kept at the registered office of each of the companies or at the office of its registered agent. where the shares purchase agreement creates a relevant charge, it may be desirable to ensure the priority in the british virgin islands of the charge that the particulars of the charge be registered at the office of the registrar of corporate affairs pursuant to section 163(1) of the bvi business companies act, 2004. on registration, to the extent that british virgin islands law governs the priority of a charge, such charge will have priority in the british virgin islands over a relevant charge on the property that is subsequently registered in accordance with section 163 and a relevant charge on the property that is not registered in accordance with that section, provided that a registered floating charge is postponed to a subsequently registered fixed charge unless the floating charge contains a prohibition or restriction on the power of the company to create any future charge ranking in priority to or equally with the charge. a registration fee of &#091;$100.00&#093; will be payable in respect of the registration. &#091;it should be noted that charges created before the date that each of the companies re-registered as a bvi business company under the bvi business companies act, 2004 will continue to rank in the order in which they would have ranked had the relevant section of the bvi business companies act, 2004 not come into force and thus may have priority over any of the shares purchase agreement which creates a relevant charge.&#093; under british virgin islands law, &#147;charge&#148; means any form of security interest, whether fixed or floating, over property, wherever situated, other than an interest arising by operation of law. however, as the shares purchase agreement is governed by the foreign laws, the question of whether they would constitute a charge would be determined under the foreign laws. 6. the shares purchase agreement will not be subject to stamp duty in the british virgin islands. 7. the choice of the foreign laws as the governing law of the shares purchase agreement is a valid choice of law and would be recognised and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the british virgin islands, except for those laws (i) which such court considers to be procedural in nature, (ii) which are revenue or penal laws or (iii) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of the british virgin islands. 8. an award granted pursuant to arbitration proceedings in hong kong and conducted in accordance with the foreign laws against each of the companies based upon the shares purchase agreement would be enforceable in the british virgin islands under the arbitration act cap. 6 (which incorporates the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards adopted by the united nations conference on international commercial arbitration on 10th june, 1958) either by action or by leave of the supreme court or a judge thereof, in the same manner as a judgment or order to the same effect, and where leave is so given, judgment may be entered in the terms of the award. enforcement of an award may be refused if the person against whom it is invoked proves: (a) that a party to the arbitration agreement was (under the law applicable to him) under some incapacity; or (b) that the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or, failing any indication thereof, under the law of the country where the award was made; or (c) that he was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (d) that the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; or (e) that the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or (f) that the award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, it was made. enforcement may also be refused if the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration, or if it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award. yours faithfully conyers dill &#038;
