(c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this section 1.7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and generally summarize such action. the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and to assume the defense of such claim and shall be entitled to select counsel for the defense of such claim with the approval of any parties entitled to indemnification, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties entitled to indemnification shall have the right to employ separate counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party) to participate in the defense thereof, but (assuming the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of the relevant action as aforesaid) the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such indemnified parties unless the named parties to such action or proceedings include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified parties and the indemnifying party or such indemnified parties shall have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in which case, if the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party, as the case may be, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any such action or proceeding or separate or substantially similar or related action or proceeding in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel at any time for the indemnifying party and all indemnified parties, which counsel shall be designated in writing by the holder. if the indemnifying party withholds consent to a settlement or proposed settlement by the indemnified party, it shall acknowledge to the indemnified party its indemnification obligations hereunder. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 1.7 from an indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect to any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action, suit, proceeding or claim. in no event shall the amount of any such contribution payable by a holder exceed the amount payable by the holder under section 1.7(b) hereunder. 1.8 rule 144 exceptions. the company shall not be obligated under this sections 1 to register or include in any registration statement any registrable securities if the company shall furnish the holders requesting such registration a written opinion of counsel to the company reasonably satisfactory to the requesting holders, that all registrable securities may be publicly offered, sold and distributed without registration under the securities act within a single ninety (90) day period pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act. 1.9 lockup agreement. each stockholder agrees in connection with any registration of the company's securities, upon the request of the underwriter(s) managing that offering, not to lend, offer, pledge, grant, sell, make any short sale of, sell any option or contract to purchase of or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities (other than those included in the registration) without the prior written consent of the company during the seven (7) days prior to and during the one hundred eighty (180) day period beginning on the effective date of such registration. in order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to registrable securities of ach holder (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period. 2. miscellaneous. 2.1 notices. notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be sufficiently given when personally delivered or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed (i) if to the company, at one logan square, 130 n. 18th street, philadelphia, pennsylvania 19103, attention: general counsel;
