31, 2010, the initial public offering of a portion of the common stock (the &#147;ipo&#148;) priced. on april 7, 2010, the ipo was consummated. pursuant to the terms of such securities purchase

acquired 16,412,440 shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for a total of 4,103,110 shares of common stock or non-voting common stock of primerica, for an aggregate purchase price of $230,000,000. the securities purchase agreement pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, on april 15, 2010, wp x made an investment of $230,000,000 in primerica through the acquisition of 16,412,440 shares of common stock. wp x also received warrants currently exercisable to purchase 4,103,110 shares of common stock (or, under certain circumstances, shares of non-voting common stock of primerica) at a price of $18.00 per share (the &#147;warrants&#148;). the term of the warrants is seven years. the common stock and the warrants purchased by wp x are subject to transfer restrictions. the purchase price per share of common stock and warrant to purchase 0.25 shares of common stock was approximately $14.01. pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, wp x had the right to elect to purchase up to an additional $100 million worth of common stock at $15.00 per share, the public offering price in the ipo. wp x waived this right. pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the board of directors of primerica (the &#147;board&#148;) elected michael e. martin and daniel zilberman as directors of primerica, effective april 15, 2010, each to serve until his successor shall have been appointed and qualified or until he shall have resigned or been removed. mr. martin will serve as chair of primerica&#146;s compensation committee. mr. zilberman will serve as a member of primerica&#146;s nominating and corporate governance committee. wp x is currently entitled to designate two nominees to the board. once wp x&#146;s investor ownership percentage (as defined below) is less than 15%, but greater than 7.5%, wp x will only be entitled to nominate one director to serve on the board, and once wp x&#146;s investor ownership percentage is less than 7.5%, wp x will no longer be entitled to nominate any such directors. in addition, for so long as there is at least one member of the board designated by wp x, and subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange (including independence requirements), each committee of the board must include at least one of wp x&#146;s nominees. investor ownership percentage is calculated by dividing (i) the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by wp x and its affiliates in the aggregate (assuming exercise or conversion of all securities held by wp x and its affiliates that are exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock, regardless of whether such conversion or exercise would be permitted at such time); by (ii) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at such time (assuming exercise or conversion of all securities held by wp x and its affiliates that are exercisable for or convertible into common stock, regardless of whether such conversion or exercise would be permitted at such time). however, any shares of common stock (or securities exercisable for or convertible into common stock), restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom unit o r stock or other award based in whole or in part on the price of common stock issued or granted after the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement to any person other than wp x and its affiliates are to be excluded for purposes of such calculation. for so long as wp x has rights to nominate one or two directors, primerica has agreed to nominate wp x&#146;s designees as its nominees with respect to such positions on the board, and cihc has agreed to vote its shares of common stock in favor of wp x&#146;s board nominees, and not to take any action to remove wp x&#146;s board nominees from the board without the consent of wp x. in addition, pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, cihc and its affiliates have agreed to limit their representation on the board to one member, and the parties to the securities purchase agreement have agreed that the size of the board will be no greater than nine. cihc and primerica have agreed to consult in good faith with wp x on the selection of the independent directors to be added to the board. wp and wp llc have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, they and their controlled affiliates will not own more than 35% of the voting power of primerica&#146;s voting securities or 45% of primerica&#146;s economic equity interests (the &#147;ownership limits&#148;). it will not be a violation of the ownership limits if the 35% or 45% thresholds are exceeded solely due to any decrease in the number of outstanding shares of primerica&#146;s common stock as a result of actions taken by primerica. wp x has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, it will not transfer any shares of common stock acquired pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, any warrants, or any shares of common stock or non-voting common stock of primerica issued upon exercise of the warrants prior to the earlier of (i) the date that is 18 months after the completion of primerica&#146;s initial public offering or (ii) the date on which cihc and its affiliates (other than primerica and subsidiaries of primerica) own less than 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis. among other exceptions, this restriction will not prohibit transfers not involving a public offering to parties who are not, and are not affiliated with, manufacturers or distributors of life insurance products. wp x has the right to exchange any shares of non-voting common stock that it receives upon exercise of the warrants for shares of common stock, or shares of common stock for shares of non-voting common stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis, subject to the ownership limits. subject to certain minimum ownership percentages, primerica has agreed to provide wp x with certain information and access rights. in addition, subject to certain minimum ownership percentages, wp x&#146;s prior written consent will be required for primerica to engage in certain actions, including certain extraordinary transactions, changes in its authorized or issued capital stock, amendments to its governing documents, certain affiliate transactions, payment of certain dividends, and changes in the size of the board. subject to certain minimum ownership percentages and other exceptions, wp llc has certain preemptive-type rights with respect to certain issuances of equity securities by primerica. pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and following the closing date of the transactions contemplated by such agreement, subject to certain ownership limitations included therein, cihc has agreed that, for so long as cihc and its affiliates own at least 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, wp llc has a right of first offer so that wp llc may offer to acquire shares of common stock proposed to be sold by cihc in any public offering or private placement on the same terms as such proposed issuance, subject to specified exceptions (including transfer to affiliates of cihc, transfers to charitable organizations for no consideration and transfers that in the aggregate do not exceed 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock). in any case, cihc may decline wp llc&#146;s offer if it determines in good faith that it is reasonably likely to obtain a highe r price from a third party or the public. the foregoing summary of the securities purchase agreement is not intended to be complete and is
