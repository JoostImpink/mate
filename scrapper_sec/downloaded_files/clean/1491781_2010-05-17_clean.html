(e) if the indemnification provided for in this section 5.6 is unavailable to hold harmless each of the indemnified parties against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses to which such parties may become subject under the securities act, then the indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying each party entitled to indemnification -27- hereunder, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified parties on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses. the relative fault of such parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by or concerning the indemnifying party on the one hand, or by such indemnified party on the other, and such party&#146;s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to have corrected or prevented such statement or omission; provided , however , that the obligations of each of the selling investors hereunder shall be several and not joint. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person that is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. section 5.7. miscellaneous .
