"shareholder agreement"), which is attached hereto as exhibit 99.2 and (ii) a registration rights agreement, dated october 3, 2000 (the "registration rights agreement"), which is attached hereto as exhibit 99.3. pursuant to the shareholder agreement, the company agreed that, following the merger, as long as the reporting person beneficially owns voting securities of the company representing at least 10% of the voting power of all of the company's voting securities outstanding, the company will take all necessary action to cause a nominee of the reporting person to be elected to the company's board of directors. the reporting person has designated its chief financial officer, theo melas-kyriazi, to serve as its initial representative on the company's board of directors. additionally, the reporting person agreed that, so long as it beneficially owns voting securities of the company representing at least 5% of the voting power of all of the company's voting securities outstanding, the reporting person will not (i) acquire any voting securities of the company without prior consent of the board of directors of the company, (ii) sell or otherwise transfer any shares

received in the merger prior to the date eighteen months following the consummation of the merger, or (v) sell or transfer any shares of common stock of the company in privately negotiated

counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum at any shareholder meeting of the company and (ii) provide the company's management with a proxy or consent to vote such shares of common stock owned by the reporting person, but not more than a number of shares representing 5% of the voting power of securities of the company outstanding at the closing of the merger. pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the company agreed to (i) file with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective an `evergreen' or `shelf' registration statement registering for resale by the reporting person the common stock of the company received by the reporting person in the merger, (ii) file a registration statement, or a post-effective amendment to the shelf registration statement, for an underwritten offering of the shares of common stock of the company received by the reporting person in the merger at various times, and (iii) provide the reporting person the right to include the shares of common stock of the company received by the reporting person in the merger in any registration statement filed by the company with the sec, other than registration statements relating to employee plans and acquisitions. the timing of the effectiveness of the `shelf' registrations corresponds to the

debentures remain obligations of cardiosystems, but are convertible into shares of common stock of the company, at a conversion price of $37.623 per share, which is $31.415 divided by the 0.835 merger exchange ratio. additionally, the 4 3/4% debentures are guaranteed by the reporting person, which guarantee remains in effect after the merger. cardiosystems has agreed to reimburse the reporting person for any payments made by the reporting person under such guarantee. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the company has obtained a standby letter of credit in the amount of $45 million to support the repayment of the 4 3/4% debentures and to reduce the prospect that the reporting person will be required to pay any amount under its guarantee of the 4 3/4% debentures. as

(b) tec acknowledges that the thoratec shares may be transferred in the absence of registration under the securities act only pursuant to an exemption from such registration and in accordance with this agreement. the thoratec shares will be subject to stop transfer orders. the certificates representing the thoratec shares will bear the following legends: "the securities represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which rule 145 promulgated under the securities act of 1933 applies. in addition, the securities represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions on transfer and the other provisions of a shareholder agreement dated as of october 2, 2000, as it may be amended from time to time, between thoratec and tec, a copy of which is on file at the principal executive office of thoratec."

(d) notwithstanding the restrictions on transfers imposed by sections 6(b) and 6(c), tec may transfer thoratec shares in whole or in part if such transfer is: (i) in connection with, or at any time following the consummation of, a transaction approved by the board of directors of thoratec resulting in the sale of substantially all of the consolidated assets of thoratec or the merger (other than the merger) of thoratec with another entity pursuant to which the shareholders of thoratec immediately before that merger will not possess more than 50% of the voting power of thoratec or the surviving entity immediately after that merger; (ii) to a person in connection with a tender or exchange offer by such person which is approved by a majority of thoratec's board of directors and reflected in a schedule 14d-9 filed with the securities and exchange commission; (iii) to thoratec or any person designated by thoratec's board of directors as specifically expressed in a resolution, in exchange for cash, securities or other consideration specified by thoratec's board of directors and subject to whatever other conditions may be specified in that resolution or (iv) to any affiliate of tec, but only if the transferee, its affiliates and the members of any group of which the transferee is a member agree in writing to be bound by this agreement as if they were tec, with such modifications thereto as thoratec deems reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this agreement (by way of example, if tec's obligations under this agreement shall have terminated because tec no longer holds the requisite number of shares under section 11 of this agreement, the agreement with the transferee and its affiliates and members of that group shall make clear that their obligations shall nevertheless continue if, together, they hold that requisite amount). (e) no thoratec shares shall be transferred pursuant to any privately negotiated transaction (except as permitted by section 6(d) above) if, after giving effect to that transfer, the transferee, its affiliates and members of any group of which the transferee is a member would together beneficially own voting securities representing more than 10% of the voting power. 7. disclosure. tec hereby agrees to permit thoratec to publish and disclose in the registration statement and joint proxy statement/prospectus (including all documents and schedules filed with the securities and exchange commission) contemplated by the merger agreement, and in any press release or other disclosure document that thoratec reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the merger and any transactions related thereto, tec's identity and ownership of tca common stock and the nature of tec's commitments, arrangements and understandings under this agreement, provided, that any such disclosure document filed with the securities and exchange commission, and to the extent practicable any press releases and similar disclosures, will be submitted to tec for comment prior to filing or dissemination. 8. voting of thoratec common stock. tec hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, during the period commencing with the closing of the merger and continuing until the termination of this agreement: (a) tec shall, and shall cause its affiliates and members of any group of which tec is a member to, appear (in person or by proxy) at any meeting (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of thoratec common stock, however called, or otherwise cause the voting securities beneficially owned by them to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing and maintaining a quorum. (b) tec shall, and shall cause its affiliates and members of any group of which tec is a member to, vote or provide a written consent with respect to the voting securities beneficially owned by them, but not more than a number of shares representing 5% of voting power of voting securities outstanding upon the closing of the merger in the manner directed by thoratec management at any such meeting or pursuant to such written consent, provided, that if and to the extent necessary to assure the election of the tec nominee, tec may deviate from this principle. (c) tec shall not, and shall cause its affiliates and members of any group of which tec is a member, not to deposit any voting securities beneficially owned by them in a voting trust or subject any voting securities beneficially owned by them to any arrangements or agreements with respect to the voting of such voting securities; provided that this restriction shall not apply to any voting securities beneficially owned by tec in excess of a number of shares representing 5% of the voting power of voting securities outstanding upon the closing of the merger. (d) thoratec shall indemnify and hold harmless tec and each officer, director, employee, agent, representative or person who controls tec (within the meaning of the securities act), against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable legal fees and expenses) resulting from (x) the agreement by tec, pursuant to section 8(b) above, to vote shares of thoratec as directed by thoratec management or (y) the voting of any such shares as so directed by thoratec management, tec shall (i) give prompt notice to thoratec of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification hereunder and (ii) permit thoratec to assume the defense of such claims with counsel of thoratec's choice, provided that tec shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of tec unless: (a) thoratec shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to tec in a timely manner or (b) in the reasonable judgment of tec, based upon the advice of outside counsel, a material potential conflict of interest exists between tec and thoratec with respect to such claim (in which case, if tec notifies thoratec in writing that tec elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of thoratec, thoratec shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of tec). tec will not be required to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term given by the claimant or plaintiff to tec of a release from all liability in respect of such claim. thoratec will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for tec with respect to any such claim. if for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to tec or insufficient to hold it harmless, then thoratec shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by tec as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by thoratec and tec, but also the relative fault of thoratec and tec, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. thoratec shall have no obligation of indemnity with respect to voting on any specific matter pursuant to (y) above, if thoratec notifies tec that it releases tec's obligations with respect to voting the shares on such particular matter at least three business days prior to any vote and thoratec does not vote the shares on such particular matter. (e) at the closing of the merger the parties shall execute a certificate setting forth the calculation of the number of shares referenced in (b) and (c) above. 9. limitations on ownership. except as otherwise set forth in this agreement, thoratec shall not impair or otherwise adversely restrict or limit the exercise of any voting or other rights of the voting securities held by tec, whether through an amendment to its articles of incorporation or its bylaws, through any agreement or otherwise. without limiting the foregoing, thoratec shall exempt tec from the provisions of any shareholder rights plan and shall not adopt any other "anti-takeover" measure (including but not limited to any supermajority voting requirement, control share provision or acceleration provision) that treats tec in any manner different from that treatment accorded each other holder of voting securities. 10. equitable remedies. thoratec and tec acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this agreement were not performed in accordance with their terms or were otherwise breached. accordingly, they agree that the non-breaching or potentially breaching party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without the need to post bond, to prevent or cure any breaches of this agreement (including, without limitation, its section 5) and to enforce specifically the provisions hereof in any court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which that party may be entitled at law or in equity. 11. options. the parties acknowledge that tec has issued options to purchase 66,700 shares of issued and outstanding tca common stock owned by tec. upon consummation of the merger, these options will become exercisable for shares of thoratec common stock. tec agrees not to issue any additional securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of tca common stock. thoratec acknowledges that if the options are exercised, the shares of thoratec common stock issuable upon exercise of the options will not be subject to this agreement. 12. termination. this agreement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (a) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its article viii and (b) such time as tec beneficially owns less than 5% of the voting power. 13. miscellaneous. (a) this agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by written agreement of thoratec and tec. (b) any failure of tec, on one hand, or thoratec, on the other hand, to comply with any provision of this agreement may be waived by thoratec or tec, respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with that provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

and (ii) if such registration statement is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of such requesting securityholders, thoratec will include in such registration: (a) first, all securities of such requesting securityholders requested to be included therein and (b) second, up to the full amount of securities requested to be included in such registration by the holders and other persons (allocated pro rata among such holders and such other persons on the basis of the amount of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder or other person), so that the total amount of securities to be included in such offering is the full amount, that in the written opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without materially and adversely affecting the success of the offering. anything to the contrary in this agreement notwithstanding, thoratec may withdraw or postpone a registration statement referred to in this section 5 at any time before it becomes effective or withdraw, postpone or terminate the offering after it becomes effective without obligation to any holder. in addition, this section 5 is subject to section 6(c). if an offering in connection with which a requesting securityholder is entitled to registration under this section 5 is an underwritten offering, any requesting securityholder whose registrable securities are included in the registration statement shall, unless otherwise agreed by thoratec, offer and sell the registrable securities in an underwritten offering using the same underwriter or underwriters and, subject to this agreement, on the same terms and conditions as other shares of common stock included in the underwritten offering. 6. registration procedures.

(iv) furnish to each selling holder of registrable securities and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, as many conformed copies as may reasonably be requested of the then effective registration statement and any post-effective amendments thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits (including those incorporated by reference);

(vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling holders of registrable securities, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of such registrable securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any selling holder of registrable securities or underwriter reasonably requests in writing, provided that thoratec will not be required to: (a) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify, but for this paragraph (vi), (b) subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction or (c) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction; (vii) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec relating to such registration and the distribution of the securities being offered and make generally available to its securities holders earnings statements satisfying section 11(a) of the securities act; (viii) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the national association of securities dealers, inc.; (ix) subject to the proviso in paragraph (vi) above, cause the registrable securities covered by the registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the selling holders or the underwriters, if any, to complete the disposition of such registrable securities (other than as may be required by the governmental agencies or authorities of any foreign jurisdiction and other than as may be required by a law applicable to a selling holder by reason of its own activities or business other than the sale of registrable securities); (x) cooperate with the selling holders of registrable securities, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing registrable securities to be sold, which certificates will not bear any restrictive legends; and cause such certificates to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the selling holders or managing underwriters, if any, shall request; and (xi) to the extent requested by the holders of registrable securities in connection with a proposed underwritten offering, but in no event more than once in any twelve month period commencing on the date of the immediately preceding request. (a) execute and deliver an underwriting agreement containing customary terms, including without limitation, appropriate restrictions on thoratec's ability to issue or sell any shares of its common stock or securities convertible or exercisable or exchangeable therefor and any requirement, to the extent permitted by the applicable thoratec stock option plans or other agreements, to enforce available restrictions on the ability of any option holder to exercise options 6 or on any stockholder to sell any shares of thoratec common stock, (b) to the extent reasonably necessary to facilitate the success of any such underwritten offering, make available the appropriate executive officers of thoratec for due diligence and drafting sessions and road show presentations in connection with such underwritten offering and (c) prepare and file with the sec a current report on form 8-k with such underwriting agreement attached as an exhibit thereto. within 120 days of the execution of this agreement, thoratec will obtain agreements from each of its executive officers and directors to execute and deliver an agreement imposing customary restrictions (not exceeding 90 days from the commencement of the underwritten offering) on such executive officer's or director's ability to sell any shares of thoratec common stock beneficially owned, if requested by the managing underwriter of any such underwritten offering. thoratec will require any newly hired or appointed executive officer or director to enter into a similar agreement upon the commencement of employment or term as a director. if, in connection with such underwritten offering, thoratec is not selling any securities, tca will pay all out-of-pocket expenses of thoratec related to any road show presentation. as a condition precedent to the participation in any registration hereunder, thoratec may require each selling holder of registrable securities as to which such registration is being effected to furnish to thoratec such reasonable information regarding such person and the distribution of such securities as thoratec may from time to time request. (b) discontinuance. each holder of registrable securities shall, upon receipt of any notice from thoratec of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 6(a)(ii), forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the then current registration statement until: (a) such holder is advised in writing by thoratec that a new registration statement covering the offer of registrable securities has become effective under the securities act or (b) such holder receives copies of any required supplemented or amended prospectus, or until such holder is advised in writing by thoratec that the use of the registration statement may be resumed. if thoratec shall have given any such notice during a period when a compulsory registration is in effect, thoratec shall extend the period during which the registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this agreement by the number of days during which any such disposition of registrable securities is discontinued pursuant to this section 6(b). if so directed by thoratec, on the happening of such event, each holder will deliver to thoratec (at thoratec's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the registration statement covering such registrable securities at the time of receipt of such notice. (c) selection of underwriter. the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage any compulsory registration will be selected by thoratec, subject to approval of the selling holders holding a majority of the registrable securities covered by the compulsory registration statement that gave the original compulsory notice in connection with such compulsory registration, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 7. certain limitations on registration rights. (a) hold-back election. in the case of the registration of any underwritten primary offering initiated by thoratec (other than any registration by thoratec on form s-4 or form s-8 (or any successor or substantially similar form, and other than in connection with (i) an employee stock option, stock purchase or compensation plan or of securities issued or issuable pursuant to any such plan or an acquisition of any securities or assets of another entity, or (ii) a dividend reinvestment plan) or any underwritten secondary offering initiated at the request of a requesting securityholder, each holder that includes registrable securities therein agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of securities of thoratec, except as part of such underwritten registration, during the period beginning 15 days prior to the expected date of execution of an underwriting agreement relating to such underwritten offering and ending 90 days after such closing date (or such shorter period as may be agreed to between the underwriters thereof and thoratec or any other security holder of thoratec selling securities in such offering). the parties acknowledge that the expected date of execution of an underwriting agreement shall be made in the good faith determination of the managing underwriter of such offering and communicated in writing to such holders. 7 (b) material development condition. with respect to any registration statement filed or to be filed pursuant to section 3, if thoratec determines that, in its good faith judgment, it would (because of the existence of, or in anticipation of, any acquisition or corporate reorganization or other transaction, financing activity, stock repurchase or other development involving thoratec or any subsidiary, or the unavailability for reasons substantially beyond thoratec's control of any required financial statements) require public disclosure by thoratec of material non-public information that is not included in such registration statement and that immediate disclosure of such information would be seriously detrimental to thoratec (a "material development condition"), thoratec shall, notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, be entitled, upon the giving of a written notice that a material development condition has occurred (a "delay notice") from thoratec to any holder of registrable securities included or to be included in such registration statement: (i) to cause sales of registrable securities by such holder pursuant to such registration statement to cease, or (ii) if no such registration statement has yet been filed or declared effective, to delay the filing or effectiveness of any such registration statement until, in the good faith judgment of thoratec, such material development condition no longer exists (notice of which thoratec shall promptly deliver to any holder of registrable securities with respect to which any such registration statement has been filed). notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) in no event may such cessation or delay (i) be for a period of more than 60 consecutive days from the giving of the delay notice to a holder with respect to the material development condition, as above provided, and (ii) exceed 90 days in the aggregate in any 12 month period and the shelf registration period with respect to such holder and registrable securities shall be extended by the number of days during the shelf registration period that such holder is required to refrain from selling registrable securities. (c) limitation on piggyback registration rights. anything to the contrary contained in this agreement notwithstanding, when, in the opinion of reputable outside securities counsel for thoratec, the registration of the registrable securities is not required by the securities act in connection with a proposed sale of such registrable securities, the holders shall have no rights pursuant to section 5 to request a piggyback registration in connection with such proposed sale and thoratec shall promptly provide to the transfer agent and the holder's or holders' broker or brokers in connection with any sale transaction an opinion to that effect. 8. registration expenses. all expenses incident to thoratec's performance of or compliance with this agreement including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications or registrations, or the obtaining of exemptions therefrom, of the registrable securities), printing expenses (including expenses of printing prospectuses), messenger and delivery expenses, internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), fees and disbursements of its counsel and its independent certified public accountants, securities acts liability insurance (if thoratec elects to obtain such insurance), fees and expenses of any special experts retained by thoratec in connection with any registration fees and expenses of other persons retained by thoratec and reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for all selling holders (all such expenses being referred to as "registration expenses") shall be borne by thoratec, provided that registration expenses shall not include any fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the holders, the expenses of any special audit or accounting review (other than a review or audit of thoratec's year-end financial statements), out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the holders and underwriting discounts, commissions or fees attributable to the sale of the registrable securities. 9. indemnification. (a) indemnification by thoratec. thoratec shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, but without duplication, each holder of registrable securities, and each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the securities act), against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable legal fees and expenses) resulting from any untrue statement of a material fact in, or any omission of a material fact required to be stated in, any registration statement or prospectus or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to thoratec or to any underwriters by any 8 holder expressly for use therein. thoratec shall also indemnify underwriters participating in the distribution, their officers, directors, employees, partners and agents, and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act), to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities, if so requested. (b) indemnification by holders of registrable securities. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder will furnish to thoratec in writing such information and affidavits as thoratec reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, but without duplication, thoratec, its officers, directors, stockholders, employees, advisors and agents, and each person who controls thoratec (within the meaning of the securities act), against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable legal fees and expenses) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact in, or any omission of a material fact required to be stated in, any registration statement or prospectus or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such holder to thoratec specifically for inclusion therein. in no event will the liability of any holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel of such indemnifying party's choice, provided that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified person unless: (a) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person in a timely manner or (b) in the reasonable judgment of any such indemnified person, based upon the advice of outside securities counsel, a potential conflict of interest exists between such indemnified person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claim (in which case, if the indemnified person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such indemnified person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such indemnified person). the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its written consent. no indemnified person will be required to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term given by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified person of a release from all liability in respect of such claim. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of the claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all persons indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim. (d) contribution. if for any reason the indemnification provided for in section 8(a) or section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified person or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by section 8(a) and 8(b), then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified person as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party and the indemnified person, but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified person, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement or the omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand, or the indemnified person or persons on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentations. 9 10. participation in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such person: (i) agrees to sell such person's registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and signs all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and in form and substance approved by thoratec. nothing in this section 10 shall be construed to create any additional rights regarding the registration of registrable securities in any person otherwise than as set forth herein. 11. options. the parties acknowledge that tec has issued options to purchase 66,700 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of tca owned by tec. upon consummation of the merger, these options will become exercisable for shares of thoratec common stock. tec agrees not to issue any additional securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of tca common stock. thoratec acknowledges that if the options are exercised, the shares of thoratec common stock issuable upon exercise of the options will not be subject to this agreement. 12. amendments. this agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions may not be given, unless thoratec has obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding. 13. waivers. any failure of tec or another holder, on one hand, or thoratec, on the other hand, to comply with any provision of this agreement may be waived by thoratec or tec or that holder, respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party granting the waiver, but that waiver or the failure to insist upon strict compliance with that provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 14. notices. all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by overnight courier or similar means or sent by facsimile with written confirmation of receipt, to the parties at the addresses specified below or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice, provided that notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. any such notice shall be effective upon receipt, if personally delivered, or on the next business day following transmittal, if sent by confirmed facsimile. notices shall be delivered as follows: (a) if to a holder other than tec, at the most current address given by that holder to thoratec, in accordance with this section 14.

"voting power" for this purpose has the same meaning that it has in the shareholder agreement that was signed with the merger agreement. any such assignment shall not be effected unless and until the assignee assumes in writing all the obligations under this agreement that correspond to the rights being assigned to that assignee, as determined in good faith by thoratec. this agreement shall be binding upon any successor to thoratec (including any entity issuing securities in exchange for the registrable securities). 16. governing law. this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of california without reference to its principles of conflicts of law. 17. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 18. severability. if any provision of this agreement should be finally determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect against a party hereto, it shall be adjusted if possible to effect the intention of the parties. in any event, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall only apply as to such party in the specific jurisdiction where such final determination shall have been made. 19. headings. the section headings in this agreement are solely for the purpose of reference and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this agreement. the word "including" shall mean "including without limitation." 20. entire agreement. this agreement, the merger agreement and the shareholder agreement referenced previously embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this agreement. 21. additional actions. from time to time, at either party's request and without further consideration, the other party hereto (and any holder in addition to tec) shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to effectuate this agreement. 11 22. representation of counsel. each party to this agreement has been represented by counsel during the preparation and negotiation of this agreement, and therefore waives any rule of construction that would construe ambiguities against the party drafting this agreement. in witness whereof, the parties hereto have executed this agreement as of the date first written above. thoratec laboratories corporation by: /s/ d. keith grossman ------------------------------------ name: d. keith grossman title: president and chief executive officer thermo electron corporation by: /s/ theo melas-kyriazi -------------------------------------- name: theo melas-kyriazi title: chief financial officer 12 -----end privacy-enhanced message-----
