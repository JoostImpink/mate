its series f preferred stock and its warrant, occurred on january 22, cusip no. 648904200 page 8 of 17 pages 2001. under the terms of the purchase agreement, hd iii purchased (i) 20,000,000 shares of series f preferred stock (the "series f preferred stock") and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to 8,484,112 shares of common stock (the "warrant"). the form of the warrant is attached hereto as exhibit 99.3. pursuant to paragraph (f) of the warrant, the number of shares that hd iii may receive upon exercise of its warrant is subject to upward adjustment depending on certain future events affecting the capitalization of new world. the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant are entitled to registration rights under the terms of an amended and restated registration rights agreement among new world, hd iii, brookwood new world investors, llc ("brookwood") and bet associates, l.p.("bet"), attached hereto as exhibit 99.4. contemporaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement, new world entered into an exchange agreement (the "exchange agreement") with brookwood and bet. pursuant to the exchange agreement, contemporaneously with the closing of the purchase agreement, all of the shares of series d preferred stock held by brookwood and bet were exchanged for shares of series f preferred stock, and warrants held by brookwood and bet were exchanged for new warrants with substantially the same terms and conditions as the warrant held by hd iii. according to the certificate of designation, preferences and rights of the series f preferred stock (the "certificate of designation"), attached hereto as exhibit 99.5, holders of series f preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by new world's board of directors, and to the extent funds are legally available, cumulative dividends payable quarterly, commencing on march 31, 2001 at the rate of 16% per annum (the "dividend percentage rate") of the liquidation preference. the dividends are payable in kind as additional shares of series f preferred stock. the liquidation preference for each share of series f preferred stock is equal to $1,000 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. the dividend percentage rate will increase by an additional 2% per semi-annum on each january 18 and july 18, commencing on january 18, 2002, on each outstanding share of series f preferred stock until such share of series f preferred stock has been redeemed by new world as required by the certificate of designation. no dividends or other distributions of any kind may be declared or paid on, nor will new world redeem, purchase or cusip no. 648904200 page 9 of 17 pages acquire any shares of the common stock, any of the series a preferred stock, the series b preferred stock, the series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or any other junior class or series of stock other than stock dividends and distributions of the right to purchase common stock and repurchase any such rights in accordance with new world's rights agreement dated june 7, 1999 (the "rights plan"), unless all dividends on the series f preferred stock accrued for all past dividend periods have been paid. the certificate of designation provides that the series f preferred stock is redeemable at the election of new world, in whole or in part, at any time ("optional redemption date") on not less than 5 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, for an amount equal to 100% of the purchase price (as defined below), plus all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends, if any, to the date of redemption (the "redemption price"). the "purchase price" of each share of the series f preferred stock shall be $1,000 (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares). all outstanding shares of series f preferred stock must be redeemed (subject to the legal availability of funds therefor) in whole on the earlier of january 18, 2004 or the closing date of new world's acquisition of 70% or more of the outstanding stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of einstein/noah bagel corporation ("einstein"), or the acquisition by einstein of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of new world (the "mandatory redemption date"), at the redemption price. in the event that new world fails to pay the redemption price in cash on the mandatory redemption date, the redemption price will be paid on such date by the issuance of a senior subordinated note (the "note"), in the form attached hereto as exhibit 99.6. under the terms of the purchase agreement, if within one year of the closing, (i) new world fails to redeem the series f preferred stock in accordance with the terms set forth in the certificate of designation, (ii) new world redeems the series f preferred stock by the issuance of the note, but has not paid the note in full or (iii) a business combination with einstein has not occurred and the series f preferred stock has not been redeemed in full in accordance with the certificate of designation, new world will be required to cusip no. 648904200 page 10 of 17 pages issue to hd iii a warrant representing an additional 1.5% of the fully diluted common stock (taking into account all options, warrants and other convertible securities of new world, but not including any outstanding warrants or options with a strike price greater than $3.00 per share and not including the new warrants) outstanding on such first anniversary date and on each june 30 and december 31 thereafter. the percentage will be reduced pro rata to the extent that the series f preferred stock issued to hd iii has been redeemed or the note has been repaid. hd iii is entitled to receive additional warrants in certain circumstances. new world has amended its bylaws to provide that the authorization of at least 75% of the board of directors is required to authorize the filing of a petition under the united states bankruptcy code and increased the number of directors to nine. under a stockholders agreement among new world, hd iii, brookwood and bet, dated as of january 18, 2001 (the "stockholders agreement"), attached hereto as exhibit 99.7, new world must take all necessary actions to cause the election of two directors designated by hd iii; provided, however, that if the shares of series f preferred stock held by hd iii are redeemed for cash in accordance with the certificate of designation or the note to be issued in accordance with the certificate of designation is paid in full, hd iii will only have the right to designate one director. in addition, after such events have occurred, if hd iii owns less than 2% of the voting stock of new world, it will no longer have the right to designate any directors. the note also requires new world to take all necessary actions to casue the election of one director designated by hd iii. under the stockholders agreement, new world has granted to hd iii, brookwood and bet the right to purchase such stockholder's proportionate percentage in future offerings of securities of new world other than (i) issuances of certain options or warrants to employees, directors or consultants, (ii) issuances in connection with any merger or acquisition, (iii) issuances in an underwritten public offering or (iv) issuances to a bank or other institutional investor in connection with a debt financing. also pursuant to the stockholders agreement, new world granted hd iii, brookwood and bet a co-sale right in certain situations. cusip no. 648904200 page 11 of 17 pages furthermore, according to the certificate of designation, so long as any shares of series f preferred stock remain outstanding, new world may not, without the vote or written consent by the holders of at least 67% of the then outstanding shares of the series f preferred stock, voting together as a single class: (i) amend or repeal any provision of new world's certificate of incorporation or by-laws in a manner which materially and adversely affects the rights and preferences of the holders of series f preferred stock; (ii) authorize or issue shares of any class of stock having any preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to or on a parity with the series f preferred stock; (iii) pay or declare any dividend on any other type or class of securities, other than a dividend payable in common stock or rights under the rights plan; (iv) repurchase or redeem any shares of capital stock of new world other than the redemption of the series f preferred stock; (v) authorize (i) a sale of any material asset of a value in excess of $1,000,000 of new world or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of new world, (ii) a sale of any substantial portion of the assets of new world or any subsidiary or subsidiaries (other than sales of stores owned by new world or its subsidiaries) or (iii) a recapitalization or reorganization of new world or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the new world (other than stock splits, combinations and/or dividends); (vi) take any action that results in new world or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of new world incurring or assuming more than $1,000,000 of funded indebtedness (other than borrowings of up to $17,119,848 by new world for funded debt, either on an individual or accumulative basis except (a) that new world may obtain substitute financings for its existing line of credit on similar terms from a substitute lender up to the outstanding loan balance on the existing line of credit on the date of such substitution, and (b) as contemplated by the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement; cusip no. 648904200 page 12 of 17 pages (vii) effect any change of control event, except as contemplated by the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement; (viii) effect (i) an acquisition of another corporation or other entity, or a unit or business group of another corporation or entity, by merger or otherwise, except as contemplated by the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement or (ii) the purchase of all or substantially all of the capital stock, other equity interests or assets of any other entity or person, except as contemplated in the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement; (ix) increase the number of directors of the board of directors of new world except as contemplated in the purchase agreement and the exchange agreement; (x) effect or allow fundamental change in the nature of new world's business; (xi) otherwise materially affect the rights, privileges and preferences of the holders of new world's series f preferred stock; or (xii) effect any change of the executive officers of new world. under the certificate of designation, the holders of series f preferred stock, except as otherwise required under the laws of delaware or as set forth in the certificate of designation, are not to entitled or permitted to vote on any matter required or permitted to be voted upon by the stockholders of new world. under the certificate of designation and the note, the majority of the then outstanding series f preferred stock, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class, will be entitled to elect up to four directors (the "series f directors"), provided that two of the series f directors shall be designated by hd iii. if (i) dividends on the series f preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for any quarterly period, which failure to pay continues for a period of thirty (30) days; or (ii) new world fails to discharge any redemption obligation with respect to the series f preferred stock and such failure continues more cusip no. 648904200 page 13 of 17 pages than 90 days following a mandatory redemption date, then (a) the number of members comprising new world's board of directors will automatically increase by such number so that such additional directors (but including the board seats elected by the holders of series f preferred stock) constitutes not less than 50% of the board of directors of new world and (b) the holders of the majority of the then outstanding series f preferred stock, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class, will be entitled to elect directors to the board of directors to fill the vacancies created by such increase, provided that such directors are designated equally by (a) hd on the one hand, and (b) brookwood and bet on the other hand. such voting rights will continue until such time as, in the case of a dividend default, all dividends in arrears on the series f preferred stock are paid in full and, in the case of the failure to redeem, until payment of the redemption price in cash or until the note is delivered, at which time the term of the directors elected as described in this paragraph will terminate. new world may not modify, change, affect or amend the certificate of incorporation or the certificate of designation to increase the authorized series f preferred stock, without the affirmative vote or consent of holders of at least 67% of the shares of series f preferred stock then outstanding, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class. hd iii was paid a transaction fee of $500,000 upon consummation of the transaction. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

(2) if any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the company (other than as set forth in subsection (1) of this section (f)), or consolidation or merger of the company with another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation shall be effected, then, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holder of each warrant shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrant and in lieu of the shares of common stock of the company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights 4 represented by such warrant (the "purchasable shares"), such shares of stock, securities or assets issuable or payable with respect to or in exchange for the purchasable shares had they been purchased immediately before such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, and in any such case appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the holder to the end that the provisions of the warrant (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the exercise price and of the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants) shall thereafter be applicable as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any shares of stock, securities, or assets thereafter deliverable upon exercise of warrants. the company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof, the successor corporation (if other than the company) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume, by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to the holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder may be entitled to purchase. (3) upon the occurrence of each dilution event (as herein- after defined), the number of shares of common stock specified in this warrant shall be adjusted to that number of shares of common stock equal to the existing warrant shares plus the additional warrant shares (where x is the number of additional warrant shares derived from the following equation): the number of shares of common stock which could be purchased hereunder or have already been purchased hereunder immediately x + the existing warrant shares prior to such dilution event (the "existing warrant shares") = ------------------------------- ------------------------------- the fully-diluted common stock of the fully-diluted common stock the company immediately prior to of the company immediately after such dilution event such dilution event (including the additional warrant shares and any additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to adjustments in other warrants of the company due to such dilution event) provided, that in each case the number of shares of fully-diluted common stock shall not include shares of common stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities (including convertible debt) issued simultaneously with a dilution event but which itself is not a dilution event. for purposes of this subsection (3) the "fully-diluted common stock of the company" shall include all outstanding shares of common stock, and all shares of common stock issuable pursuant to all outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities (including convertible debt) of the company. in the event 5 that this warrant shall be exercised in full prior to a dilution event, a new warrant representing the amount of the adjustment pursuant to this subsection (3) shall be issued upon the occurrence of each dilution event and such warrant shall be substantially in the form of this warrant. the preceding provision shall survive the exercise of this warrant. the company hereby covenants that it shall not effect any such dilution event unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof, the successor corporation (if other than the company) resulting from such dilution event shall agree, by written instrument, to issue to the holder a warrant, in substantially the form of this warrant, to purchase the number of shares of common stock of such surviving corporation as provided in this subsection (3). for purposes hereof, a "dilution event" shall mean any issuance of common stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities (including convertible debt) of the company or any successor entity (including einstein) (i) to any shareholder or other stakeholder of einstein/noah bagel corporation ("einstein") as consideration for the company's acquisition of at least a majority of the stock or assets of einstein, whether by merger, consolidation, asset purchase, stock purchase or otherwise (an "einstein transaction") or to any shareholder or other stakeholder of the company as consideration for an einstein surviving transaction (as hereinafter defined), (ii) to any person or entity prior to an einstein transaction if the holders of 66-2/3% of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued by the company on the date hereof to halpern denny iii, l.p. ("halpern denny"), brookwood new world investors llc ("brookwood") and bet associates, l.p. ("bet") reasonably object to such issuance unless at least 90% of the net proceeds from such issuance are used to redeem shares of series f preferred stock, $.001 par value, of the company or the notes to be issued pursuant to the purchase agreement or the exchange agreement dated as of january 18, 2001 among the company and the several stockholders named therein, (iii) to any person or entity in connection with any equity or convertible debt financing transaction the proceeds of which are used to acquire equity or assets of einstein in an einstein transaction or equity or assets of the company in an einstein surviving transaction (as hereinafter defined) to the extent such proceeds exceed $25,000,000, or (iv) to any person or entity (x) in connection with a debt financing (other than convertible debt) in which the company or its subsidiaries is a debtor, or (y) in connection with a debt financing by einstein or its subsidiaries in which the proceeds of such financing are used to acquire equity or assets of the company in connection with an einstein surviving transaction, in each case to the extent such issuance represents in excess of 2% of the fully-diluted common stock of the company or fully-diluted common stock of einstein, as the case may be, determined by taking into account all options, warrants and other convertible securities. in the event that the company consummates a transaction with einstein (a "einstein surviving transaction") pursuant to which einstein purchases at least a majority of the outstanding stock or assets of the company, or in which einstein merges with the company and einstein is the surviving corporation, then as a condition to the company entering into any such transaction, einstein shall agree to issue to the holder a warrant in substantially the form of this warrant (the "replacement warrant") for the applicable warrant percentage of the fully-diluted common stock of einstein. the "fully-diluted common stock of einstein" shall mean (x) all outstanding shares of common stock, and all shares 6 of common stock issuable pursuant to all outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities (including convertible debt) of einstein as of the date on which the bankruptcy proceedings of einstein result in a distribution of the securities of einstein or a reorganization of einstein plus (y) any additional shares of common stock, options, warrants or other convertible securities issued pursuant to clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the definition of "dilution event" above plus (z) any additional shares of common stock of einstein issuable pursuant to adjustments in the replacement warrant and any similar replacement warrants issued to brookwood, bet, greenlight capital, l.p., greenlight capital qualified, lp, greenlight capital offshore, ltd. or halpern denny or any affiliate of the foregoing due to the dilution events listed in clause (y). for purposes hereof, the "applicable warrant percentage" shall mean the percentage which is equal to the quotient of (i) the number of shares of common stock which could be purchased hereunder or have already been purchased hereunder immediately prior to such einstein surviving transaction (including any adjustments that would be required to be made due to dilution events) divided by (ii) the number of shares of fully-diluted common stock of the company immediately prior to such einstein surviving transaction. the company shall not permit its subsidiaries, or shall not consummate an einstein surviving transaction if einstein has permitted its subsidiaries, to consummate a transaction that, if consummated by the company or einstein, as the case may be, would constitute a dilution event. (4) upon each adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to sub- section (1) of this section (f), the number of shares of common stock specified in each warrant shall thereupon evidence the right to purchase that number of shares of common stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth of a share of common stock) obtained by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of common stock purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment upon exercise of such warrant and dividing the product so obtained by the exercise price in effect after such adjustment. (5) irrespective of any adjustments of the number or kind of securities issuable upon exercise of warrants or the exercise price, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same number of shares of common stock and exercise price as are stated in similar warrants previously issued. (6) the company may, at its sole option, retain the independent public accounting firm regularly retained by the company, or another firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing selected by the company's board of directors, to make any computation required under this section (f) and a certificate signed by such firm shall be conclusive evidence of any computation made under this section (f). (7) whenever there is an adjustment in the exercise price or in the number or kind of securities issuable upon exercise of the warrants, or both, as provided in this section (f), the company shall (i) promptly file in the custody of its secretary or assistant secretary a certificate signed by the chairman of the board or the president or a vice president of the company and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the company, setting forth the facts requiring such adjustment and the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise of each warrant after such adjustment; and (ii) cause a notice stating that such adjustment has been effected and stating the exercise price then in effect and the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise of each warrant to be sent to each registered holder of a warrant. 7 (8) the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall not be adjusted except in the manner and only upon the occurrence of the events heretofore specifically referred to in this section (f). (9) the board of directors of the company may, in its sole dis- cretion, (a) reduce the exercise price of each warrant, (b) increase the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant and/or (c) provide for the issuance of other securities (in addition to the shares of common stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of the warrant) upon exercise of each warrant. (g) transfer to comply with the securities act of 1933 and other applic- able securities laws. this warrant or the warrant shares or any other security issued or issuable upon exercise of this warrant may not be sold or otherwise disposed of unless holder provides the company with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the company in form satisfactory to the company that this warrant or the warrant shares or such other security may be legally transferred without violating the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 act") and any other applicable securities law and then only against receipt of an agreement of the transferee to comply with the provisions of this section (g) with respect to any resale or other disposition of such securities. upon exercise of this warrant, the holder shall, if requested by the company, confirm in writing, that the warrant shares are being acquired solely for the holder's own account and that holder or holder's purchaser representative is an accredited investor, as defined in rule 501 under the 1933 act. (h) this warrant is subject to the rights and benefits of the amended and restated registration rights agreement dated as of january 18, 2001. 8 in witness whereof, the company has caused this warrant to be executed as of the issue date first set forth above by an authorized officer. new world coffee - manhattan bagel, inc. by: /s/ ramin kamfar ---------------------- ramin kamfar, chief executive officer attest: /s/ jerold novack, secretary ------------------ dated: january 22, 2001 purchase form dated: _______________, 2001 the undersigned hereby irrevocably elects to exercise the within warrant to the extent of purchasing shares of common stock and hereby makes payment of ________ in payment of the exercise price thereof. instructions for registration of stock name _____________________________________________ (please typewrite or print in block letters.) address __________________________________________ signature ________________________________________ assignment form for value received, hereby sells, assigns and transfers unto name _____________________________________________ (please typewrite or print in block letters.) address __________________________________________ the right to purchase common stock represented by this warrant to the extent of ______ shares as to which such right is exercisable and does hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint ______________, attorney, to transfer the on the books of the company with full power of substitution in the premises. date ____________, 2001 signature ____________________________________ ex-99.4 5 0005.txt registration rights agreement exhibit 99.4 amended and restated registration rights agreement this amended and restated registration rights agreement (this "agreement") dated as of january 18, 2001, by and between new world coffee - manhattan bagel, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company") and the holders of certain warrants listed on schedule i hereto (the "stockholders"), amending and restating the registration rights agreement dated as of august 11, 2000 (the "initial registration rights agreement"), by and between the company, bet associates, l.p., and brookwood new world investors, llc (the "initial stockholders"). background on august 11, 2000, the company and the initial stockholders entered into the series d preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement (the "series d purchase agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the initial stockholders agreed to purchase up to 16,216.216 shares of the company's series d preferred stock at a purchase price of $925.00 per share (the "series d shares") and the company delivered warrants in the form attached to the series d purchase agreement and agreed to issue in the future certain additional warrants in similar form (collectively, the "series d warrants"). on the date hereof, the company and certain purchasers of the series f preferred stock (the "new stockholders", and together with the initial stockholder, the "stockholders") entered into the series f preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement (the "series f purchase agreement", pursuant to which, among other things, the new stockholders agreed to purchase up to 20,000 shares of series f preferred stock (the "shares") at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share and the company delivered warrants in the form attached to the series f purchase agreement and has agreed to issue in the future certain warrants in similar form (collectively, the "series f warrants"). the initial stockholders have entered into an exchange agreement dated as of january 18, 2001 (the "exchange agreement") and pursuant to such exchange agreement, such initial stockholders have agreed to surrender the series d shares (plus all accrued and unpaid paid-in-kind dividends thereon) and the series d warrants in exchange for 16,398.33 shares of series f preferred stock (the "shares") and new warrants in the form attached to the exchange agreement (collectively, the "exchange warrants", and together with the series f warrants, the "warrants"). capitalized terms used in this agreement and not otherwise defined in this agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the series f purchase agreement. as a material term of the series f purchase agreement, the company has agreed to grant to the new stockholders certain registration rights with respect to the registrable securities and the initial stockholders have agreed to amend and restate the initial registration rights agreement as hereinafter provided. therefore, the parties agree as follows: 1. registration rights. the company covenants and agrees as follows: 1.1 definitions. for purposes of this section 1: (a) the term "1934 act" means the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. (b) the term "act" means the securities act of 1933, as amended. (c) the term "holder" means any person owning or having the right to acquire registrable securities or any assignee of registrable securities in accordance with section 1.9 of this agreement. (d) the term "register," "registered," and "registration" refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement in compliance with the act, and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement. (e) the term "registrable securities" means the shares of common stock issued or issuable (i) upon exercise of the warrants; and (ii) any securities of the company issued or issuable in exchange for, or in replacement of the common stock, excluding shares of common stock which may be immediately sold under rule 144. (f) the term "sec" means the securities and exchange commission. 1.2 demand registration. (a) if the company receives at any time, a written request from the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding (the "initiating holders") that the company file a registration statement under the act covering the registration of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the registrable securities then outstanding, then the company shall: (i) within 10 days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all holders; (ii) use all reasonable efforts to file as soon as practicable, and in any event within 60 days of the receipt of such request, a registration statement for registration under the act of all registrable securities which the holders request to be registered, subject to the limitations of subsection 1.2(b); and (iii) use all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective. (b) if the initiating holders intend to distribute registrable securities by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the company as a part of their request made pursuant to subsection 1.2(a), and the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in subsection 1.2(a). 2 the underwriter will be selected by the initiating holders and shall be an underwriter of regional or national standing reasonably acceptable to the company. in such event, the right of any holder to include registrable securities in the registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in the underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and such holder). all holders proposing to distribute their securities through the underwriting shall (together with the company as provided in subsection 1.4(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 1.2, if the underwriter advises the initiating holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the initiating holders shall so advise all holders of registrable securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant to this subsection, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all holders, including the initiating holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of registrable securities of the company owned by each holder; provided, however, that the number of shares of registrable securities to be included in the underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company furnishes to initiating holders a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the company stating that the company is engaged in an offering for itself or others or that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be detrimental to the company for a registration statement to be filed and it is therefore necessary to defer the filing of the registration statement, the company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to the filing for a period of not more than 120 days after receipt of the request of the initiating holders; provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve-month period. (d) in addition, the company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to this section 1.2 (i) after the company has effected two registrations pursuant to this section 1.2 and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective or (ii) if such demand registration would then be filed within six months of the initial filing of an earlier demand registration under this section 1.2 or a registration under section 1.9. 1.3 piggyback registration. if the company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the company for stockholder other than the holders) any of its stock under the act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a registration on form s-4 or form s-8 or successors thereto or on any other form which does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the registrable securities), the company shall, at such time, promptly give each holder written notice of such registration. upon the 3 written request of each holder given within 20 days after mailing of such notice by the company, the company shall, subject to the provisions of section 1.4,cause to be registered under the act all of the registrable securities that each such holder has requested registrable securities to be registered. in the event that the company decides, for any reason, not to complete the registration of shares of common stock other than the registrable securities, or in the event that inclusion of the registrable securities would in the opinion of the managing underwriter for the offering (or the company if there is no underwriter), impair an offering by the company or its stockholders for whom the registration statement is filed, the company shall have no obligation under this section 1.3 to register, or continue with the registration of, the registrable securities. 1.4 obligations of the company. whenever required under this section 1 to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to 120 days or until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been completed, whichever is earlier; provided, however, that the 120-day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the holder is prohibited from selling any securities included in such registration pursuant to section 1.10 hereof or the terms of any lockup agreement entered into at the request of the company or an underwriter. (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement. (c) furnish to the holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of registrable securities owned by them. (d) use reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by the registration statement under other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the holders; provided that the company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions. (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering. 4 (f) notify each holder of registrable securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the act or the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. (g) cause all registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed. (h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement and a cusip number for all such registrable securities, in each case not later than the effective date of the registration. (i) use reasonable efforts to furnish, at the request of any holder requesting registration of registrable securities pursuant to this agreement, on the date that the registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration pursuant to this section 1, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, or, if such securities are not being sold through underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the company, in form and substance as is customarily given by counsel to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, and (ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering. 1.5 expenses of registration. the company shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing or qualification of registrable securities with respect to the registrations pursuant to sections 1.2 or 1.3 for each holder, including (without limitation) all registration, filing, and qualification fees, printers and accounting fees relating or apportionable thereto and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the company and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling holders selected by them, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities. 1.6 underwriting requirements. in connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the company's capital stock, the company shall not be required under section 1.3 to include any of the holders' securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the company and the underwriters selected by it (or by other persons entitled to select the underwriters), and then only in such quantity as the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the company and such other persons for whom the registration statement was filed. if the total amount of securities, including registrable securities, to be included in such underwriting exceeds 5 the amount of securities, other than the securities to be sold by the company, that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then the company shall be required to include in the underwriting only that number of registrable securities, if any, which the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the registrable securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among the selling stockholders having piggyback registration rights according to the total amount of registrable securities entitled to be included therein owned by each selling stockholder of registrable securities or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by such selling stockholder of registrable securities). 1.7 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement: (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, any underwriter (as defined in the act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the act or the 1934 act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and the company will pay to each such holder, underwriter or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action, subject to the limitations of section 1.7(c) below; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by or for any such holder, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the act, any underwriter and its officers, and directors, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are 6 based upon written information furnished by or for such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this subsection exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, than an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 7 (e) the obligations of the company and holders under this section shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement under this agreement. 1.8 reports under securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144, the company agrees to use reasonable efforts to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144;

corporation law of the state of delaware new world coffee - manhattan bagel, inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of delaware (the "corporation"), does hereby certify: a. that pursuant to the authority contained in article 4 of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and in accordance with the provisions of section 242 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, its board of directors has adopted the following resolution creating a series of the preferred stock, $0.001 par value, designated as series f preferred stock (the "series f preferred stock"): resolved, that a series of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of the corporation be hereby created, and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are: designation and amount. there is hereby established a series of the preferred stock designated "series f preferred stock" (herein referred to as "series f preferred stock"), consisting of 65,000 shares and having the relative rights, designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, and restrictions applicable thereto as follows: 1. dividends. (a) the holders of shares of series f preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the corporation, and to the extent of funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends payable quarterly, on each march 31, june 30, september 30 and december 31, commencing on march 31, 2001, with dividends for partial quarters based on the dates of issuance and redemption accruing pro rata. such dividends shall be paid, for each quarterly period, at the rate of 16% per annum (the "dividend percentage rate") of the liquidation preference, payable each quarter as 4% as payment in kind series f preferred stock; provided, however, that the dividend percentage rate shall be increased by an additional 2% per semi-annum on each january 18 and july 18, commencing on january 18, 2002 on each outstanding share of series f preferred stock until such share of series f preferred stock has been redeemed by the corporation as required by section 3 hereof, and provided further that to the extent that the corporation has insufficient available surplus to declare the dividend, the board of directors of the corporation shall undertake to use its best efforts to increase the available surplus and thereafter shall immediately declare such dividend. dividends on the series f preferred stock shall be cumulative so that if, for any dividend accrual period, dividends at the rate hereinabove specified are not declared and paid or set aside for payment, the amount of accrued but unpaid dividends shall accumulate, and shall be added to the dividends payable for subsequent dividend accrual periods. if the funds legally available for the payment of such dividends are insufficient to pay in full the dividends payable on all outstanding shares of series f preferred stock, the total available funds may be paid in partial dividends to the holders of the outstanding shares of series f preferred stock ratably in proportion to the fully accrued dividends to which they are entitled. each issued and outstanding share of series f preferred stock shall entitle the holder of record thereof to receive an equal proportion of said dividends (adjusted for issuance dates). (b) no dividends or other distributions of any kind shall be declared or paid on, nor shall the corporation redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of the common stock, any of the series a preferred stock, the series b preferred stock, the series c preferred stock or series d preferred stock or any other junior class or series of stock other than stock dividends and distributions of the right to purchase common stock and repurchase any such rights in accordance with the rights agreement dated june 7, 1999, unless all dividends on the series f preferred stock accrued for all past dividend periods shall have been paid. 2. liquidation preference. (a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the series f preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, on a pro rata basis, such amount, paid prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the corporation to the holders of the common stock or any other junior class or series of stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount equal to $1,000 per share of series f preferred stock then outstanding ("liquidation preference") (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares), plus all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such share for each share of series f preferred stock then held by them. in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the series f preferred stock shall rank at least pari passu with any security hereinafter existing or created ("parity stock"). if upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the series f preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of the series f preferred stock and of any parity stock the full amounts to which they otherwise would be entitled, the holders of series f preferred stock and such parity stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the entire assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution pro rata in proportion to the respective liquidation preference amounts which would otherwise be payable upon liquidation with respect to the outstanding shares of the series f preferred stock and such parity stock if all liquidation preference dollar amounts with respect to such shares were paid in full. 2 (b) upon the completion of the distribution required by subparagraph (a) of this section 2, the remaining assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the common stock pro rata based on the number of shares of common stock held by each, and the holders of series f preferred stock shall not be entitled to participate in such distribution. (c) for purposes of this section 2, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this corporation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include (a) a change in 50% or more of the members of the board of directors, nominated and recommended by the board of directors for election at the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders except changes in investor appointed directors, (b) a consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into any other corporation (other than (i) a merger in which the corporation is the surviving corporation and which will not result in more than 50% of the capital stock of the corporation being owned of record or beneficially by persons other than the holders of such capital stock immediately prior to such merger or (ii) a transaction contemplated by the series f preferred stock and warrant purchase agreement dated january 18, 2001 (the "purchase agreement") and the exchange agreement dated january 18, 2001 (the "exchange agreement")), (c) a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the corporation as an entirety to any other person or persons in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (d) an acquisition of "beneficial ownership" by any "person" or "group" of voting stock of the company representing more than 50% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of such voting stock, whether by way of merger or consolidation or otherwise, other than pursuant to the exercise of the warrants contemplated by the exchange agreement, the purchase agreement and agreements with other investors disclosed in the schedules thereto and/or the transfer of the common stock purchased pursuant to such agreements with other investors (collectively, the "investor securities"), or (e) any other transaction which results in the disposition of 50% or more of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of the corporation on a combined basis, other than relating to the purchase of the investor securities (an event or series of events under subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) above shall be referred to as a "change of control event"). the holders of 67% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the series f preferred stock may execute a written waiver of any change of control event. 3. redemption. the shares of series f preferred stock shall be redeemable as follows: (a) optional redemption.

(b) mandatory redemption. (i) all outstanding shares of series f preferred stock shall be redeemed (subject to the legal availability of funds therefor) in whole on the earlier of january 18, 2004 or the closing date of the corporation's acquisition of 70% or more of the outstanding stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of einstein/noah bagel corporation, or the acquisition by einstein of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the company ("acquisition of einstein") (the "mandatory redemption date" and together with the "optional redemption date", the "redemption date"), at the redemption price. (ii) failure to redeem. in the event that the corporation fails to pay the redemption price on the mandatory redemption date, the redemption price will be paid by the issuance of senior subordinated notes (the "notes"), which notes will be substantially in the form of the note attached as exhibit d to the purchase agreement and exhibit b to the exchange agreement and all outstanding shares of series f preferred stock shall be deemed to be retired and no longer outstanding. (c) procedure for redemption. (i) not more than 60 and not less then 5 days prior to any optional redemption date, and as soon as practical prior to the mandatory redemption date, written notice (the "redemption notice") shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of shares of series f preferred stock to be redeemed on the record date fixed for such redemption of the shares of series f preferred stock at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock register of the company. the redemption notice shall state: (a) the redemption price; (b) whether all or less than all of the outstanding shares of series f preferred stock are to be redeemed and the total number of shares of series f preferred stock being redeemed; 4 (c) the number of shares of series f preferred stock held by the holder that the corporation intends to redeem; (d) the redemption date; (e) that the holder is to surrender to the corporation, at the place or places designated in such redemption notice, its certificates representing the shares of series f preferred stock to be redeemed; (f) that dividends on the shares of series f preferred stock to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on such redemption date unless the corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price; and (g) the name of any bank or trust company performing the duties referred to in subsection (c)(iv) below. (ii) on or before the redemption date, each holder of shares of series f preferred stock to be redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares of series f preferred stock to the corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the redemption notice, and on the redemption date the full redemption price for such shares of series f preferred stock shall be payable in cash to the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be returned to authorized but unissued shares of series f preferred stock. in the event that less than all of the shares of series f preferred stock represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares of series f preferred stock. (iii) unless the corporation defaults in the payment in full of the redemption price, dividends on the shares of series f preferred stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue on the redemption date, and the holders of such shares shall cease to have any further rights with respect thereto on the redemption date, other than the right to receive the redemption price, without interest. (iv) if a redemption notice shall have been duly given or if the corporation shall have given to the bank or trust company hereinafter referred to irrevocable authorization promptly to give such notice, and if on or before the redemption date specified therein the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been deposited by the corporation with such bank or trust company in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares of series f preferred stock called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of series f preferred stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after the time of such deposit, all shares so called, or to be so called pursuant to such irrevocable authorization, for redemption shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect of such shares of series f preferred stock shall forthwith cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders 5 thereof to receive from such bank or trust company at any time after the time of such deposit the funds so deposited, without interest. the aforesaid bank or trust company shall be organized and in good standing under the laws of the united states of america, and shall have capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $100,000,000 according to its last published statement of condition, and shall be identified in the redemption notice. any interest accrued on such funds shall be paid to the corporation from time to time. any funds so set aside or deposited, as the case may be, and unclaimed at the end of three years from such redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the corporation, after which repayment the holders of the shares of series f preferred stock so called for redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment hereof. (v) if the redemption price will be paid by the issuance of notes as required by section 3(b)(ii) above, the corporation will issue to each holder of shares of series f preferred stock that has surrendered the certificate or certificates representing such shares of series f preferred stock, a note in the principal amount of the aggregate redemption price payable to such holder, including the increases in the redemption price required by section 3(b)(ii) above, and payable to the holder as such holder's name appears on the stock register of the corporation. the corporation will, within 5 days following the 90th day following the mandatory redemption date, send notice to each holder that has not surrendered the certificate or certificates representing its shares of series f preferred stock stating that the redemption price is to be paid by the issuance of notes and confirming the location at which such certificates are to be surrendered. such notice shall be sent in the same manner as was required for the redemption notice. thereafter, not later than five days following any surrender by a holder of certificates representing shares of series f preferred stock, the corporation will issue to such holder a note in the amount specified above. 4. protective rights.
