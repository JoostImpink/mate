(the "company"). the address and principal executive office of the company is 1245 corporate boulevard, suite 401, aurora, illinois 60504. item 2. identity and background. - ------ ----------------------- this schedule 13d is filed pursuant to rule 13d-1(a) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), by united technologies corporation ("utc") and solar acquisition corp. ("solar" and, together with utc, the "reporting persons"). utc is a delaware corporation with its principal business and principal office located at one financial plaza, hartford, connecticut 06101. utc and its consolidated subsidiaries provide high technology products to aerospace and building systems customers throughout the world. solar acquisition corp., a delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of utc with its principal business and principal office located at one financial plaza, hartford, connecticut 06101. solar has, to date, engaged in no activities other than those incident to its formation and the commencement of the offer (as defined below) and the merger (as defined below). the names, addresses, occupations and citizenship of the executive officers and directors of each of utc and solar are set forth in schedule i hereto. none of the reporting persons nor, to the best of their knowledge, any of the directors or officers listed in schedule i has, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration - ------- ------------------------------------------------- on october 13, 2000, utc, solar and the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which solar will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares (the "offer") and, following the consummation of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, solar will be merged with and into the company, and the company will be the surviving corporation (the "merger"). concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on october 13, 2000, utc and solar entered into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement") with the malcolm i. glazer family limited partnership, kevin e. glazer and page 4 of 16 avram a. glazer (each a "stockholder" and collectively the "stockholders"), who own in the aggregate approximately 39.8 percent of the outstanding shares. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, each stockholder agreed, among other things, to validly tender (and not withdraw) all shares beneficially owned or subsequently acquired by such stockholders, to grant solar an option (the "option") to purchase all such shares at a price of $30.50 per share (or such other price as may be payable in the offer) upon the occurrence of certain events, and to vote all such shares in favor of the merger and the merger agreement and against any proposal or offer, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by any person or group (in each case, whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the stockholders of the company generally) relating to (a) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase which is structured to permit such person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries or of over 10% of any class of equity securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person, other than utc, solar, their affiliates or any group of which any of them is a member beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or (c) any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries (an "acquisition proposal"). the offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements. utc and solar estimate that the total amount of funds required to purchase all of the outstanding shares beneficially owned by the stockholders, in the offer or pursuant to the option, will be approximately $236,929,337. utc and solar estimate that the total amount of funds required to purchase all of the outstanding shares pursuant to the offer and the merger, including those shares beneficially owned by the stockholders, and to pay related fees and expenses will be approximately $614 million. solar will obtain such funds from utc. utc currently intends to obtain such funds from available cash on hand at the time of the completion of the offer. references to, and descriptions of, the offer, the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement in this schedule 13d are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the merger agreement and stockholder agreement, respectively, included as exhibits 1 and 2 to this schedule 13d, and incorporated in this schedule 13d in their entirety where such references and descriptions appear. item 4. purpose of transaction. - ------ ---------------------- the purpose of the offer and the merger is to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. the offer, as the first step in the acquisition of the company, is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all outstanding shares. the purpose of the merger is to acquire all of the capital stock of the company not purchased pursuant to the offer or otherwise. if solar owns a majority of the issued and outstanding shares following the consummation of the offer, it will have the ability under the dgcl to approve the merger without the approval of the holders of any other shares, although a stockholder vote may be necessary. if, however, after consummation of the offer, solar owns at least 90 percent of the shares then outstanding, solar will be able to cause the merger to occur without a vote of the company's stockholders. page 5 of 16 in connection with the offer, utc and solar have reviewed, and will continue to review, various possible business strategies that they might consider in the event that solar acquires control of the company, whether pursuant to the offer, the merger or otherwise. such strategies could include, among other things, changes in the company's business, corporate structure, capitalization or management. pursuant to the merger agreement, promptly after solar has purchased shares pursuant to the offer, solar will have the right to have persons designated by it become directors of the company so that the total number of such persons equals the number, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is the product of the total number of directors on the board of directors of the company and the percentage that the aggregate number of shares purchased bears to the total number of shares then outstanding. the merger agreement provides that the company will promptly take all actions necessary to cause such solar designees to be so elected, including, upon request by solar, using its best efforts to seek the resignations of one or more existing directors. at such time, the company will also cause, if requested by solar, (x) each committee of the board of directors, (y) the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries of the company and (z) each committee of such board to include persons designated by solar constituting up to the same percentage (provided up to the nearest whole number) of each such committee or board as solar's designees constitute on the board of directors. in addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, the company (a) has established october 18, 2000 as a record date for the written consent by the company's stockholders to such election and (b) has filed with the commission a schedule 14a (together with any supplements or amendments thereto the "schedule 14a") regarding the solicitation of written consents to the election of the solar designees which contains the information required by schedule 14a under the exchange act necessary to enable the solar designees to be elected to the board of directors. until the time the merger becomes effective (the "effective time"), the company, solar and utc will use all reasonable best efforts to retain as members of the board of directors at least two directors who were directors of the company on the date of the merger agreement and who are not representatives of utc (the "independent directors"). following the time solar designees constitute a majority of the board of directors of the company and prior to the effective time, any amendment or termination of the merger agreement which requires action by the company, any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations of utc under the merger agreement, any exercise or waiver of any of the provisions of the merger agreement providing rights or remedies to the company and any other action by the company that could adversely affect the interest of the stockholders (other than utc, solar and their affiliates) with respect to the merger agreement, the merger or the offer will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the independent directors. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, each stockholder has granted solar an irrevocable option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the shares beneficially owned by such stockholder (the "option shares") at the price per share payable in the offer, exercisable at any time in whole after (a) the occurrence of any event as a result of which utc is entitled to receive a termination fee under the merger agreement or (b) such stockholder shall have breached certain specified agreements contained in the stockholder agreement. each such option that becomes exercisable will remain exercisable until the later of (x) the date that is 60 days after the date such option became exercisable, and (y) the date that is ten days after the later of the date that all waiting periods under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act page 6 of 16 of 1976 (as amended) required for the purchase of the shares upon such exercise shall have expired or been terminated and the date on which all approvals required under any foreign antitrust and competition laws or regulations applicable to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer or the merger have been obtained; provided that if at the expiration of such period there is in effect any injunction or other order issued by any governmental entity prohibiting the exercise of such option, the exercise period will be extended until ten days after the date that no such injunction or order is in effect. each stockholder has also agreed that, unless the merger agreement has been terminated, at any meeting of the stockholders of the company, however called, or in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the company, such stockholder will vote (or cause to be voted) all shares held of record or beneficially owned by such stockholder (a) in favor of the merger, the execution and delivery by the company of the merger agreement and the approval of the terms thereof and each of the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement and any actions required in furtherance thereof and (b) against any proposal relating to an acquisition proposal and against any action or agreement that would impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the stockholder agreement, or result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the company under the merger agreement or which would result in any of the conditions described in the merger agreement not being fulfilled. each such stockholder irrevocably granted to and appointed solar as such stockholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution) to vote the shares beneficially owned by such stockholder, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such shares, in the manner specified above. each stockholder has agreed that, except as provided by the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement, such stockholder will not (a) offer to transfer, transfer or consent to any transfer of, any or all of the shares beneficially owned by such stockholder or any interest therein, (b) enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding with respect to any transfer of any or all of such shares or any interest therein, (c) grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization or consent in or with respect to such shares, (d) deposit such shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such shares or (e) take any other action that would make any representation or warranty of such stockholder contained in the stockholder agreement untrue or incorrect or in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of its obligations thereunder or the transactions contemplated thereby or by the merger agreement. each stockholder has agreed that neither such stockholder nor any of its affiliates, representatives or agents will (and, if such stockholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, such stockholder will cause its officers, directors, partners, and employees, representatives and agents, including its investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, not to), directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, or afford any access to the properties, books or records of the company or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise take any other action to assist or facilitate, any person or group (other than utc or solar or any affiliate or associate of utc or solar) concerning any acquisition proposal. each stockholder has agreed to immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of the stockholder agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal. each stockholder has agreed to page 7 of 16 immediately communicate to solar the terms of any acquisition proposal (or any discussion, negotiation or inquiry with respect thereto) and the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal or inquiry which it may receive. the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of company in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving corporation until amended as provided by law, such certificate of incorporation and, with respect to the by-laws, such by-laws. if the merger is consummated as planned, the shares will be deregistered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and cease to be listed on the new york stock exchange. except as set forth in this item 4, utc and solar have no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. - ------ ------------------------------------ (a) - (b) as a result of the stockholder agreement, utc and solar may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 7,768,175 shares, representing 39.8% of the outstanding shares of the company. the calculation of the foregoing percentage is based upon the number of shares disclosed by the company to utc and solar as outstanding as of october 12, 2000, which excludes any shares that may be issued upon the exercise of issued and outstanding company stock options. to the knowledge of utc and solar, no director or executive officer of utc or solar beneficially owns any shares of the issuer. (c) except as set forth herein, there have been no transactions by the reporting persons in securities of the company during the past 60 days. to the knowledge of the reporting persons, there have been no transactions by any director or executive officer of utc or solar in securities of the company during the past 60 days. (d) to the knowledge of the reporting persons, the stockholders have the right to receive dividends and other proceeds with respect to the shares except as determined in accordance with the stockholder agreement. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with ------------------------------------------------------------- respect to securities of the issuer. ----------------------------------- other than the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement, to the knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships among the persons named in item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the company, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts page 8 of 16 or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. -------------------------------- 1. agreement and plan of merger, dated as of october 13, 2000, among specialty equipment companies, united technologies corporation and solar acquisition corp.
