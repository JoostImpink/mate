(d) no further ownership rights in company common stock. all merger consideration issued or paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates in accordance with the terms of this article i (including any cash paid pursuant to this article i) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of company common stock theretofore represented by such certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares of company common stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. if, after the effective time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation or the exchange agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this article i, except as otherwise provided by law. (e) no fractional shares. (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of buyer common stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates, no dividend or distribution of buyer shall relate to such fractional share interests and such frac- 6 14 tional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of buyer. (ii) as promptly as practicable following the effective time, the exchange agent shall determine the excess of (a) the number of whole shares of buyer common stock delivered to the exchange agent by buyer pursuant to section 1.3(a) over (b) the aggregate number of whole shares of buyer common stock to be distributed to former holders of company common stock pursuant to section 1.3(b) (such excess being herein called the "excess shares"). following the effective time, the exchange agent shall, on behalf of former stockholders of the company, sell the excess shares at then-prevailing prices in the over-the-counter market through one or more member firms of the national association of securities dealers, inc. (the "nasd"), and in round lots to the extent practicable. the exchange agent shall use reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the excess shares as promptly following the effective time as, in the exchange agent's sole judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of certificates formerly representing company common stock, the exchange agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders (the "common shares trust"). the company shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the exchange agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the excess shares. the exchange agent shall determine the portion of the common shares trust to which each former holder of company common stock is entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the common shares trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former holder of company common stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of company common stock held at the effective time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all former holders of company common stock are entitled. (iii) notwithstanding the provisions of section 1.3(e)(ii), buyer may elect at its option, exercised prior to the effective time, in lieu of the issuance and 7 15 sale of excess shares and the making of the payments hereinabove contemplated, to pay each former holder of company common stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such former holder (after taking into account all shares of company common stock held at the effective time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the last reported sale price for a share of buyer common stock (as reported in the wall street journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the closing date, and, in such case, all references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale of the excess shares and similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to the payments calculated as set forth in this section 1.3(e)(iii). (iv) as soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of certificates formerly representing company common stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the exchange agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of certificates formerly representing company common stock subject to and in accordance with the terms of section 1.3(c). (f) termination of exchange fund. any portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates for six months after the effective time shall be delivered to buyer, upon demand, and any holders of the certificates who have not theretofore complied with this article i shall thereafter look only to buyer for payment of their claim for merger consideration, any dividends or distributions with respect to buyer common stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of buyer common stock. (g) no liability. none of buyer, the surviving corporation, the company or the exchange agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of buyer common stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of buyer common stock or any cash from the exchange fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. if any certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the effective time (or immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to 8 16 this article i would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity (as defined in section 3.3(b)), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (h) investment of exchange fund. the exchange agent shall invest any cash included in the exchange fund, as directed by buyer, on a daily basis. any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to buyer. (i) lost certificates. if any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by buyer, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as buyer may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable merger consideration with respect thereto and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of buyer common stock deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, in each case pursuant to this agreement. section 1.4 company options. (a) at the effective time, each of the then outstanding options (as defined below) shall be (i) assumed by buyer, in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock plan (as defined below) and option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the effective time, buyer and its board of directors or compensation committee, as the case may be, shall be substituted for the company and its subsidiaries and their respective boards of directors (including if applicable the entire board of directors) administering any such stock plan, and (ii) converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of buyer common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of company common stock subject to such option at the effective time by the exchange ratio, at an exercise price per share of buyer common stock equal to the exercise price per share of such option immediately prior to the effective time divided by the 9 17 exchange ratio; except that, in the case of an option to which section 421 of the code applies by reason of its qualification under section 422 of the code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if the company determines that such adjustment is necessary, to comply with section 424(a) of the code. if the foregoing calculation results in an assumed option being exercisable for a fraction of a share of buyer common stock, then the number of shares of buyer common stock subject to such option shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. except as otherwise set forth in this section 1.4 and except to the extent required under certain agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the company and certain of its employees, the term, status as an "incentive stock option" under section 422 of the code (if applicable), all applicable restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all other terms and conditions of options will (except as otherwise provided in the applicable stock plan or option) to the extent permitted by law and otherwise reasonably practicable, be unchanged. as soon as practicable following the date of this agreement, the board of directors of the company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the stock plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the provisions of this section 1.4(a).

(c) as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, buyer shall deliver to each holder of an assumed option an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant to such option. the company and buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions which are necessary in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this section 1.4 as of the effective time.
