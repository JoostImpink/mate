(iii) adjustment for failure to exercise option. in the event that the company or its designee fails to exercise its option as provided in section 3(d)(i), the threshold percentage shall be increased to a percentage equal to the percentage of the actual voting power held by the investor group upon the expiration of the right to exercise such option by the company or such designee. (iv) voting of incremental shares. until the incremental shares shall have been disposed as provided in section 3(d)(ii) and, if applicable, the option of the company or its designee provided in section 3(d)(i) shall have expired, the incremental shares shall be voted in a manner proportionate to shares voted by the shareholders of the company other than the investor group and the disqualified affiliates. 10 (v) no intentional circumvention. the investor shall not attempt to circumvent the provisions of this section 3(d) by taking any action that would have the effect of extending the periods for which section 16(b) liability would apply.

(ii) if the registration of which the company gives notice is for a public sale consisting of an underwritten public offering (in which event the underwriter shall be selected by the company, in its sole discretion), the company shall so advise the investor as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 6(c)(i)(a). in such event, the right of the investor to registration pursuant to this section 6(c) shall be conditioned upon the investor's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of the investor's registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. the investor, if its shares are to be included in such registration, shall (together with the company and the other shareholders distributing their common stock through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the representative. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6(c), if the representative advises the investor or the company in writing that (x) the inclusion of shares held by the officers and directors of the company in the offering could, in the representative's best judgment, materially reduce the offering price per share, or (y) that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then, in the case of the preceding clause (x), the common stock held by officers and directors of the company shall be excluded from such underwriting to the extent so advised by the representative and, in the case of the preceding clause (y), the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting by the investor and other shareholders requesting inclusion in such registration (but not the company) shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares requested by the investor and such other shareholders to be included in such registration), by such minimum number of shares as is necessary to comply with such limitation. if the investor disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the representative, given a reasonable period of time prior to the finalization of the underwriting arrangements. any registrable securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall not be included in such registration. if at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement, the company shall determine for any reason not to register such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the investor and, thereupon, shall be relieved of 17 its obligation under this section 6(c) to register any of the registrable securities in connection with such registration. (iii) number and duration. the investor shall be entitled to have its shares included in an unlimited number of registrations pursuant to this section 6(c). the rights of the investor to registration of its registrable securities under this section 6(c) shall continue until (x) all the registrable securities owned by it shall have been transferred to transferees who are not entitled to the registration rights of the investor hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof or, if earlier, (y) all its remaining registrable securities are already included in an effective resale registration statement on form s-3 or other appropriate form for continuous or delayed offerings or are eligible to be transferred in public sales to u.s. persons in the united states without registration under the securities act and without being subject to volume limitations under rule 144 under the securities act, provided, in the case of (y), that there is a public float of the common stock equal to at least 15% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. (d) expenses of registration. upon the exercise of registration rights set ------------------------ forth in this section 6, the company shall pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 6, provided, that such expenses shall not include selling expenses, which shall be borne by the investor pro rata on the basis of the number of its shares so registered. (e) registration procedures. in the case of each registration effected by ----------------------- the company pursuant to this section 6, the company will keep the investor advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as to the completion thereof. in connection with any offering of registrable securities registered pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this section 6, at its expense, the company shall: (i) prepare and file with the commission, as promptly as practical after receipt of a request for registration pursuant to this section 6, a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies, and which form shall be available for the sale of the registrable securities in accordance with the intended methods of distribution thereof, and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective as provided herein; provided, that before filing with the commission a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company will (a) furnish to the investor copies of all such documents proposed to be filed for review and comment and (b) notify the investor of any stop order issued or threatened by the commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered; (ii) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration effective (a) during the ten business day period immediately following the date on which such registration statement shall be declared effective, and (b) subject to any obligation of the investor to refrain from selling or offering to sell any registrable securities during a blackout period (as defined below), for 120 days after the date of effectiveness or (c) if earlier, until the 18 investor has completed the distribution described in the registration statement relating thereto (but not before the expiration of the time periods referred to in section 4(3) of the securities act and rule 174 promulgated thereunder, or any successor provisions, if applicable). the company shall be entitled to elect that a registration statement not be usable, for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days (a "blackout period"), if the company determines in good faith that the use of such registration statement or the related prospectus would interfere with any pending financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or any other material corporate development involving the company, or any of its subsidiaries or would require premature disclosure thereof, and the company promptly gives the investor written notice of such determination, containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement or restriction on use and an approximation of the anticipated delay; provided, however, that (x) the company shall not be entitled to initiate a blackout period unless it shall concurrently forbid purchases or sales in the open market by directors, senior executives and other affiliates of the company, (y) the aggregate number of days included in all blackout periods during any consecutive twelve (12) month period shall not exceed two hundred forty (240) days, and (z) the period that the company shall be required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement shall be increased by the aggregate number of days in the blackout periods. the company shall give written notice to each shareholder of record included in the registration statement of the commencement and the termination of any blackout period; (iii) furnish to each underwriter, if any, and the investor such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto), and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents incident thereto as the investor may reasonably request from time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by the investor; (iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities under the state securities or "blue sky" laws of such states as the investor or the representative reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the investor and the underwriters to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by the investor; provided, that the company will not be required as a result thereof to (a) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this clause (iv), (b) subject itself to taxation or regulation of its business in any such jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be so subject or (c) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be subject to general service of process; (v) use its best efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the company to enable the investor to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities; 19 (vi) immediately notify the investor at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event that comes to the company's attention, if as a result of such event the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and subject to the blackout period provisions in clause (ii) above, the company will promptly prepare and furnish to the investor a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (vii) use its best efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on a national securities exchange in the united states or quoted on the nasdaq national market system and listed or quoted on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the company may then be listed or quoted, and enter into such customary agreements including a listing application and indemnification agreement in customary form, and, subject to applicable law, to provide a transfer agent and registrar for such registrable securities covered by such registration statement no later than the effective date of such registration statement; (viii) enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement or qualified independent underwriting agreement, in each case, in customary form) and take all such other actions as the investor requesting registration of the registrable securities being covered by such registration statement or the underwriter reasonably requests in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities, including customary representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements; (ix) make available (after reasonable notice and execution of customary confidentiality agreements satisfactory to the company) for inspection, during business hours of the company, by the investor or its representatives (if it has requested registration of registrable securities) and any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement (to the extent provided in the applicable underwriting agreement), (collectively, the "inspectors"), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company and its subsidiaries, if any, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the company's officers, directors and employees, and those of the company's affiliates, to supply all information and respond to all inquiries reasonably requested by any such inspector in connection with such registration statement; (x) use its best efforts to obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the company's appointed auditors in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort" letters as the representative reasonably requests; and 20 (xi) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and all conditions imposed by relevant governmental authorities or under applicable law and make available to the investor, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement (as the term "effective date" is defined in rule 158(c) under the securities act), which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 thereunder. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of the company to take any action with respect to any registrable securities that the investor shall furnish to the company such information regarding the registrable securities and any other securities of the company held by the investor and the intended method of disposition of the registrable securities held by the investor and such other information regarding the investor as the company shall reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with the action taken by the company. the investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 6(e)(vi) hereof, the investor will forthwith discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to any prospectus or registration statement until the investor's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 6(e)(vi) hereof, and, if so directed by the company (at the company's expense), the investor will deliver to the company all copies (including, without limitation, any and all drafts), other than permanent file copies, then in the investor's possession, of the prospectus covering such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. (f) indemnification. --------------- (i) in the event of any registration of any shares of common stock under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, the company will indemnify and hold harmless the investor, its directors and officers, each person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls the investor or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, and expenses (including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the company's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) to which the investor, any such director or officer or any such underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act, united states state securities or "blue sky" laws, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (b) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (c) any violation (or alleged violation) by the company of any united states federal, state or common law rule or regulation 21 applicable to the company and relating to action required of or inaction by the company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. the company will reimburse the investor and each such director, officer, underwriter and controlling person for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) made in such registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto or in any such preliminary, final or summary prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the investor or any such director, officer, underwriter or controlling person specifically stating that it is for use therein; provided further, however, that the company shall not be liable to any of the foregoing indemnitees pursuant to this section 6(f) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus or the final prospectus or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented, as the case may be, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such indemnitee results from the fact that the investor or underwriter sold registrable securities (x) to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the final prospectus or of the final prospectus as then amended or supplemented, whichever is most recent, if the company has previously furnished copies thereof to the investor or underwriter and such final prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, had corrected any such misstatement or omission or (y) during a blackout period or after receipt of a notice pursuant to section 6(e)(vi) hereof (prior to the amendment or supplement thereunder having been furnished). the indemnity provided for herein shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the investor or any such director, officer, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the investor or such underwriter. (ii) the investor will, if registrable securities held by it are included in any registration statement filed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (x) indemnify the company, its directors, officers and controlling persons, all other prospective sellers, each person who participates as an underwriter, and their respective directors, officers and controlling persons against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) and expenses to which any such person may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act, united states state securities or "blue sky" laws, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) or expenses arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact with respect to the investor contained in any such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the investor specifically for use therein, or (b) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact with respect to the investor required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made by the investor therein not misleading and (y) reimburse the 22 company and its directors, officers, controlling persons and all other prospective sellers, each person who participates as an underwriter, and their respective directors, officers, and controlling persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in the case of both clause (x) and clause (y), to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by the investor with respect to the investor specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the obligations of the investor hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to be received by the investor from securities sold by the investor pursuant to such registration statement or prospectus. the indemnity provided for herein shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or the investor, the underwriters or any of their respective directors, officers, or controlling persons and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the investor and such underwriters. (iii) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 6(f) (an "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom (it being understood that the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in any single action or claim (or group of related actions or claims), unless the investor shall have reasonably concluded that it may have a conflict of interest with one or more other indemnified parties with respect to any actions or claims). counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed). the indemnified party may participate in such defense at the indemnified party's expense (unless the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in such action, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party and shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 6 except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced thereby. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as a term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. each indemnified party shall promptly furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. 23 (iv) in order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the foregoing indemnities provided for in this section 6(f) are for any reason held to be unenforceable although applicable in accordance with their terms, the company and the investor shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnities in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect (a) the relative benefits received by the company, on the one hand, and the investor, on the other hand, from the offering of the registrable securities and any other securities included in such offering, and (b) the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and the investor, on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to a contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or the investor, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the investor agree that it would not be just and equitable if a contribution pursuant to this section 6(f) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the company and the investor agree that any contribution required to be made by the investor pursuant to this section 6(f) shall not exceed the net proceeds from the offering of registrable securities (before deducting expenses) received by the investor with respect to such offering. (v) the foregoing indemnities of the company and the investor are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in a preliminary prospectus, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, which was eliminated or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the commission at the time the registration statement in question became effective or the amended prospectus filed with the commission pursuant to rule 424(b) under the securities act (the "final prospectus"), such indemnities shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter if a copy of the final prospectus was furnished to the underwriter and was not furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the time such action is required by the securities act. (g) information by the investor. the investor shall furnish to the company --------------------------- such information regarding the investor and the distribution proposed by the investor as the company may reasonably request in writing in connection with any registration of registrable securities of the investor and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this section 6. 24 (h) rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of ------------------ certain rules and regulations of the commission which may permit the sale of the restricted securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act, at all times from and after the effective date of the first registration statement under the securities act filed by the company for an offering of its securities to the general public; (b) use its best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements; and (c) so long as the investor owns any registrable securities, furnish to the investor upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the current information requirements of rule 144 under the securities act (at any time from and after the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the company for an offering of its securities to the general public), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents filed with the commission pursuant to the reporting requirements of the exchange act as the investor may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing the investor to sell any such securities without registration. (i) "market stand-off" agreement. ---------------------------- (i) if any registration of common stock (or other securities) of the company shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering, the investor agrees not to effect any sale or distribution of any registrable securities, including any private placement or any sale pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act (or any successor provision) or otherwise or any sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act (or any successor provision), other than by pro-rata distribution to its shareholders, partners or other beneficial holders, and not to effect any such sale or distribution of any other equity security of the company or of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the company (in each case, other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the anticipated ten calendar days prior to, and during the 90 calendar day period (or such other period as may be agreed upon between the investor and the representative) that begins on the effective date of such registration statement, without the consent of the representative; provided, however, that written notice of such registration has been delivered to the investor at least two business days prior to the anticipated beginning of the ten calendar day period referred to above. (ii) if requested by the representative the investor shall execute a separate agreement to the foregoing effect. the company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares (or securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said 90-day or other period. the provisions of this section 6(i) shall be 25 binding upon any transferee who acquires registrable securities, including, without limitation, any permitted affiliate transferee of the investor, the investor's shareholders, partners or other beneficial holders, if such transferee is entitled to the registration rights provided hereunder. the company agrees that any agreement entered into after the date hereof pursuant to which the company issues or agrees to issue any privately placed equity securities shall contain a provision under which the holders of such securities agree not to effect any sale or distribution of any such securities during the period and in the manner referred to in this section 6(i)(ii). (iii) if any registration of registrable securities shall be in connection with an underwritten public offering, the company agrees not to effect any public sale of any of its equity securities or of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity security of the company (other than any such sale or distribution of such securities as part of such public offering, in connection with any amalgamation, merger or consolidation by the company or any subsidiary of the company, the acquisition by the company or a subsidiary of the company of the shares or any assets of any other person, or in connection with a stock option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan) during the ten days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or such other period as may be agreed upon between the company and the representative) which begins on the effective date of such registration statement without the consent of the representative. (j) transfer. if the investor shall have made a transfer as permitted by -------- the terms of this agreement of an amount of common stock representing more than 10% of the actual voting power, and unless the investor shall have agreed otherwise with the transferee of such transfer (including for this purpose, such transferee's permitted affiliate transferees) (a "transferee"), both the investor and the transferee shall remain entitled, as to the shares of common stock owned respectively by each of them, to the demand and piggyback registration rights set forth in this section 6, which shall survive such transfer. unless agreed otherwise, all rights of the investor under this section 6 with respect to such shares of common stock transferred shall terminate upon transfer. 7. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) legends. in addition to any other legends required by applicable law, ------- the company's by-laws or any other agreement restricting the transfer of the common stock, each certificate evidencing the common stock acquired by the investor will bear a legend reflecting the restrictions on the transfer of such shares contained in this agreement and in the subscription agreement.
