(c) if the indemnifier declines or fails to assume the defence of the third party claim on the terms provided above within such thirty (30) day period, the indemnified party may, at its option, employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such third party claim and, if such third party claim is a matter with respect to which the indemnified party is entitled to receive payment from the indemnifier for the loss in question, the indemnifier will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; provided, however, that the indemnifier will not be -54- required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one (1) counsel for all indemnified parties in any jurisdiction in any single third party claim.

the prior written consent of the indemnifier, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifier shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of any third party claim which would lead to liability or create any financial or other material obligation on the part of the indemnified party. 10.5.2 failure to give timely notice of third party claim the failure to provide a claim notice of a third party claim to the indemnifier shall relieve the indemnifier from liability under this agreement with respect to such third party claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to provide a claim notice to the indemnifier results in (i) the forfeiture by the indemnifier of rights and defences otherwise available to the indemnifier with respect to such third party claim, (ii) material prejudice to the indemnifier with respect to such third party claim, or (iii) the loss of any right by the indemnifier to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage. 10.5.3 procedures for direct claims any direct claim shall be asserted by giving the indemnifier reasonably prompt written

working capital deficit or the belize liabilities; and (c) if any applicable law would give the buyer indemnified parties, or any of them, the right, notwithstanding the express terms of sections 10.2

parties, or any of them, the right, notwithstanding the express terms of sections 10.3 and 3.6 to the contrary, to make a claim in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty made or given by the seller in this agreement or in any closing document after the expiry of the survival period set forth in section 3.6 with respect to such representation and warranty, the parties agree that the aggregate loss suffered or incurred by all the buyer indemnified parties as a result of, or arising in connection with, any such claim shall be deemed to be limited to $1.00. 10.6.4 reasonable steps
