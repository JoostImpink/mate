if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash (for the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such common stock, option or convertible security, but not for the purpose of the calculation of the black scholes consideration value), the amount of such consideration received or receivable by the company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the vwaps of such security for each of the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of receipt.&#160;

the fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the company and the holder.&#160; if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the &#147; valuation event &#148;), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) trading days after the tenth (10th) day following such valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the company and the holder.&#160; the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. 9 (6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

the fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the company and the holder.&#160; if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the &#147; valuation event &#148;), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) trading days after the tenth (10th) day following such valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the company and the holder.&#160; the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the company. 9 (6) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
