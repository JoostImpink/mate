("battle mountain canada"). section 4.18 of the combination agreement provides, that to the extent that noranda desires to sell any exchangeable shares it acquires pursuant to the arrangement or shares of common stock issued pursuant to the retraction and exchange rights and other provisions in respect of such exchangeable shares (including any securities issuable as a stock dividend or other distribution on, or in subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the foregoing and any other securities into which such shares may be changed or for which such securities may be exchanged) (collectively, the "noranda securities") following the first publication of financial statements that include the combined financial results of the company and battle mountain canada for a period of at least 30 days (the "commencement date"), the company will provide noranda with certain registration rights under united states law and prospectus rights under canadian law with respect to the noranda securities. noranda has transferred its interest in common shares of hemlo to kerr addison and the company is willing to extend such registration and prospectus rights to kerr addison as provided herein. as hereinafter used, the term "noranda" refers to kerr addison, and the term "noranda securities" shall refer to such securities when owned or held by kerr addison. the parties wish to set out with greater particularity the provisions governing such registration rights. accordingly, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows: 1. registration rights. ------------------- (a) demand registration. subject to section 1(d), if noranda shall, at any time or from time to time after the commencement date and prior to the termination date (as defined in section 8), provide the company with a written request for the registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), of all or part of the noranda securities, the company shall (or, as applicable, shall cause battle mountain canada to) as expeditiously as reasonably possible (but in any event not later than 60 days after receipt of a request to file a demand registration) prepare and file, and use its best efforts to cause to become effective as soon as practicable, a registration statement under the act to effect the offering of the noranda securities specified in such request in (x) an underwritten public offering or (y) a "shelf" offering for sale from time to time, provided that the amount of noranda securities for which registration is requested in connection with any such "shelf" offering shall not, without the written approval of the company, exceed u.s. $50,000,000 in market value (valued at the time of the request) and that, notwithstanding section 2(h) hereof, the period during which the company shall be required to keep effective and maintain any registration, qualification or approval obtained in connection with any such "shelf" offering, and amend or supplement the registration statement or prospectus or other offering document used in connection therewith to the extent necessary in order to comply with applicable securities law shall be limited to a period of 60 days from the date such registration statement or other offering document becomes effective. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall be entitled to defer for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of 120 days, (or in the case of a postponement pursuant to clause (i)(c) of this sentence, as soon as practicable after public disclosure of the information that was the basis for such postponement), the filing by it or battle mountain canada of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it or battle mountain canada under this section 1(a) if (i) (a) the company or battle mountain canada is at such time conducting or about to conduct an underwritten public offering of its securities for its own account and the board of directors of the company determines in good faith that such offering by the company or battle mountain canada would be materially adversely affected by such registration requested by noranda, (b) the company or battle mountain canada is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the board of directors of the company determines in good faith that the ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by such registration requested by noranda, or (c) the company is in possession of material non-public information concerning it or its business and affairs (or corresponding information concerning battle mountain canada) and the board of directors of the company determines in good faith that the prompt public disclosure of such information in a registration statement would have a material adverse effect on the company; and (ii) the company so notifies noranda within five business days after noranda so requests. if any such offering is to be underwritten, noranda shall be entitled to select the manager or managers and other underwriters for such underwritten offering, subject to the approval of the company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. (b) piggyback registration. if at any time or from time to time after the commencement date and prior to the termination date, the company or battle mountain canada shall propose to register any common stock or exchangeable shares for public sale under the act, then the company shall give noranda prompt notice of the proposed registration and shall include in such registration on the same terms and conditions as the other securities included in such registration such number of noranda securities of the same class or classes proposed to be registered as noranda shall request within 5 business days after the giving of such notice; provided, however, that the company or battle mountain canada may at any time prior to the effectiveness of any such registration statement, in its sole discretion and without the consent of noranda, abandon the proposed offering in which noranda had requested to participate. notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the company or battle mountain canada shall not be obligated to include such noranda securities in such offering to the extent the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering advise the company or battle mountain canada that the inclusion thereof would materially and adversely affect the successful marketing of the offering or would materially and adversely affect the trading market for the common stock or the exchangeable shares, in which case the priority provisions of section 1(c) shall apply, and (ii) neither the company nor battle mountain canada shall be obligated to effect any registration of such noranda securities incidental to the registration by the company or battle mountain canada of any of its securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend reinvestment plans or stock option or other director or employee benefit plans. noranda shall be entitled to withdraw any or all of its noranda securities included in a registration subject to this section 1(b) at any time before its agreement to sell such securities. as a condition to pursuing its rights under this section 1(b), noranda agrees to enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement on customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of the noranda securities. if the registration by the company or battle mountain canada referred to in the first sentence of this section 1(b) is a "shelf" registration, the priority and proration provisions set forth in this section 1(b) shall apply with respect to each discrete offering made pursuant to such registration. (c) limitation on other securities to be registered; priority. in case of any registration, offering or sale contemplated by section 1(a), the company (or battle mountain canada, as applicable) may, without the consent of noranda, include in such registration, offering or sale any securities of the same class as the noranda securities proposed to be offered. if in connection with any underwritten offering under section 1(a) the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering advise the company or battle mountain canada that the inclusion of all securities (including noranda securities) proposed to be offered would materially and adversely affect the successful marketing of the offering or would materially and adversely affect the trading market for the common stock or the exchangeable shares, there shall be included in such registration to the extent the managing underwriter or underwriters advise the company or battle mountain canada that such inclusion would not have a material adverse effect (i) first, the securities proposed to be included by noranda and any security holder other than noranda requesting such registration, pro rata in accordance with the number of securities requested to be included by noranda and such other holders, and (ii) second, securities proposed to be included by the company and/or battle mountain canada for its or their own account. in case of any registration, offering or sale contemplated by section 1(b), the company may include in such registration, offering or sale securities other than those being offered by the company and noranda; provided that, if the amount of common stock or other securities to be sold by noranda is to be reduced pursuant to clause (i) of the second sentence of section 1(b), there shall be included in such registration to the extent the managing underwriter or underwriters advise the company or battle mountain canada such inclusion would not result in such material adverse effect (1) if the registration pursuant to section 1(b) is initiated by the company or battle mountain canada to register common stock or exchangeable shares for the account of either of them, (i) first, the securities proposed to be included by the company and/or battle mountain canada to be sold for its or their own account and (ii) second, the securities proposed to be included by noranda and any security holder other than noranda requesting such registration, pro rata in accordance with the number of securities proposed to be included by noranda and such other holders, and (2) if the registration pursuant to section 1(b) is being effected pursuant to the request of a security holder other than noranda, (i) first, the securities proposed to be included by noranda and any security holder other than noranda requesting such registration, pro rata in accordance with the number of securities proposed to be included by noranda and such other holders, and (ii) second, the securities proposed to be included by the company and/or battle mountain canada, as applicable, to be sold for its or their own account. (d) number of demand registrations; separation. the company shall be obligated to effect (or to cause battle mountain canada to effect) up to an aggregate of five registrations pursuant to section 1(a), provided that the company shall not be obligated to effect (or to cause battle mountain canada to effect) more than one such registration during any period of twelve consecutive months and provided, further, that a registration shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to section 1(a) only to the extent that such registration becomes effective or to the extent noranda withdraws or cancels its demand registration request. (e) canadian offerings. in lieu of or in addition to any registration under the act as provided in section 1(a) hereof, the company or battle mountain canada, as applicable, shall, upon and in the manner and to the extent requested in writing by noranda, file a prospectus with any canadian securities regulatory authority or otherwise qualify for distribution in any province of canada (a "canadian offering") shares of common stock or exchangeable shares for which registration has been or could have been requested under section 1(a) hereof, in which case such canadian offering shall count (together with the concurrent registration under the act, if any) as one registration for purposes of section 1(d). in the event that a noranda request pursuant to the preceding sentence imposes an obligation on the company to translate its prospectus or any or all other documents filed in connection therewith into the french language, the cost of such translation (including the cost of printing translated documents) shall be for the account of noranda. if at any time or from time to time after the commencement date and prior to the termination date, the company or battle mountain canada shall propose to qualify any common stock or exchangeable shares for a canadian offering, then noranda shall be entitled, subject to applicable canadian securities law, to participate in such canadian offering to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions as it would have been entitled to participate in a registration pursuant to section 1(b) hereof. with respect to noranda's participation in any canadian offering pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section 1(e), the provisions of section 1(a) and 1(b) hereof, as applicable, and the other terms of this agreement respectively applicable thereto shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such canadian offering (for example, and without limitation, the same relative priorities under section 1(c), if applicable, shall apply to the canadian offering as to the corresponding registration in the united states and noranda shall not participate to any greater proportionate extent in the canadian offering than its participation in the corresponding registration in the united states). 2. covenants of the company. in connection with any offering of noranda securities pursuant to this agreement, the company shall (or, as applicable, shall cause battle mountain canada to): (a) furnish to noranda and to each managing underwriter, if any, a reasonable time in advance of their filing with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") any registration statement, amendment or supplement thereto, and any prospectus used in connection therewith, which documents will be subject to the reasonable review of noranda and such underwriter;

(e) furnish to noranda and to each managing underwriter, if any, addressed to each of them, an opinion of counsel for the company, dated the date of the closing of the offering of noranda securities, and a "cold comfort" letter or letters signed by the company's independent public accountants, each in reasonable and customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters delivered to such parties;

in the event the company shall give such notice, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in section 2(h) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to the date when the company (or battle mountain canada, as applicable) shall make available to noranda such supplemented or amended prospectus;

and (m) enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of the noranda securities. 3. certain noranda obligations. noranda agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event described in section 2(j), it will forthwith discontinue disposition of noranda securities until it receives copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 2(j) or until it is advised by the company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed. 4. expenses. except as provided in the next sentence, noranda shall pay a pro rata portion (on the basis of the noranda securities then being registered on its behalf in relation to all securities being registered) of all expenses incurred by the company in complying with sections 1(a) or 1(b) hereof, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees (including all expenses incident to any filing with the national association of securities dealers, inc. or listing on any domestic or foreign securities exchange), fees and disbursements of counsel for the company and its independent public accountants, fees and expenses of complying with securities and blue sky laws and printing expenses (collectively, "registration expenses"). to the extent permitted by law, the company shall, however, pay (or, as applicable, cause battle mountain canada to pay) all registration expenses incurred in complying with the first registration effected pursuant to section 1(a). in all cases, noranda shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of the noranda securities and noranda shall pay the fees and expenses of its separate counsel. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, noranda shall not be obligated to pay any expenses incurred by the company in connection with a registration pursuant to section 1(b) that is abandoned by the company or battle mountain canada under circumstances not involving any withdrawal therefrom by noranda. 5. indemnification. --------------- (a) indemnification by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless noranda, its officers, directors and agents, each underwriter of noranda securities, and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing persons within the meaning of either section 15 of the act or section 20 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising from or caused by (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the noranda securities (as amended or supplemented if the company or battle mountain canada shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (y) any violation or alleged violation by the company or battle mountain canada of the act, any blue sky laws, securities laws or other applicable laws of any state or country in which the noranda securities are offered and relating to action or inaction required of the company or battle mountain canada in connection with such offering; and will reimburse each such person for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or any proceeding in respect thereof), subject to the provisions of section 5(c), except that the indemnification agreement contained in this section shall not apply to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities that are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company or battle mountain canada by or on behalf of noranda expressly for use therein. (b) indemnification by noranda. noranda agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, battle mountain canada, their respective officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the indemnity made pursuant to clause (x) of section 5(a) above from the company to noranda, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of noranda expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the noranda securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. in no event shall the liability of noranda hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by noranda upon the sale of noranda securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 5(a) or 5(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, provided that the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability it may have under this agreement or otherwise except to the extent of any loss, damage, liability or expense arising from such omission. the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with its obligations under the preceding sentence or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party actual or potential differing interests exist between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the indemnifying party shall not agree to any settlement (i) which involves an admission of any violation of law or (ii) as the result of which any remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall be fully responsible, shall be applied to or against an indemnified party without, in either case, the prior written consent of such indemnified party. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 5 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 5(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 6. available information. the company shall take such measures and file such information, documents and reports as shall be required by the sec as a condition to the availability of rule 144, or any successor provisions. 7. termination date. the "termination date" for purposes of section 1(a) and 1(b) shall be the first date on which noranda shall no longer own noranda securities entitling noranda to "beneficial ownership" within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act of more than 5% of the outstanding exchangeable shares and shares of common stock, considered as one class. 8. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) provision of information. noranda shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees and agents to, complete and execute all such questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents as the company shall reasonably request in connection with any registration pursuant to this agreement. (b) severability. if any term or provision of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term or provision. (c) further assurances. subject to the specific terms of this agreement, each of noranda and the company shall make, execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments and documents, and take all such other actions, as may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement.

(i) parties in interest. except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing in this agreement expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer any right or benefit from any person, firm or corporation other than noranda and the company. in witness whereof, noranda, kerr addison and the company have caused this agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above written. noranda inc. by: /s/alan r. thomas ------------------------------- title: chief financial officer by: /s/kevin n. thompson ------------------------------ title: vice president, secretary and general counsel kerr addison mines limited by: /s/alex g. balogh ------------------------------ title: director battle mountain gold company by: /s/robert j. quinn ------------------------------ title: vice president ex-3 4 exhibit 3 --------- tax cooperation agreement ------------------------- tax cooperation agreement this tax cooperation agreement is entered into as of july 19, 1996, between noranda inc. ("holder") and battle mountain gold company ("bmg"). whereas hemlo gold mines inc. ("hemlo") and bmg have entered into a combination agreement, dated as of march 11, 1996 (the "combination agreement"), pursuant to which holder will acquire exchangeable shares (as defined in the combination agreement), which shares are exchangeable into shares of bmg common stock (as defined in the combination agreement); whereas bmg is a united states corporation, a portion of the assets of which constitute united states real property interests within the meaning of section 897 of internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); whereas holder desires to be informed of circumstances that could result in bmg becoming a "united states real property holding corporation" within the meaning of section 897 of the code (a "usrphc") and bmg desires to accommodate such desire and both parties desire to cooperate with respect to certain filings which are required or may be permitted under the code with respect to usrphcs; now, therefore in consideration of the premises and other good and sufficient consideration the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. cooperation. subject to section 5 below, bmg shall cooperate fully with holder in providing holder with data and information requested by holder from time to time to enable holder to determine whether bmg is or may become a usrphc. 2. prior notice of certain transactions or events. subject to section 5 below, bmg shall promptly inform holder of any anticipated transaction, event, or any other information of which bmg is aware which in bmg's good faith judgment could reasonably be expected to cause bmg to be treated as or become a usrphc. 3. consultation. if a tax cooperation agreement is entered into with only one holder, bmg shall consult with that holder before choosing any method of determining determination dates (as defined in the treasury regulations under section 897 of the code) and shall agree to utilize whichever of the methods provided in such regulations as that holder may request. if tax cooperation agreements are entered into with more than one person, bmg shall choose the method which minimizes the chance of its becoming a usrphc, after consultation with all such persons. 4. certain calculations. at any time that holder wishes to dispose of exchangeable shares or bmg common stock, bmg shall, upon holder's request, provide to holder the statement described in treasury regulation section 1.897- 2(h)(1)(i) and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of treasury regulation section 1.897-2(h) as if treasury regulation section 1.897-2(h)(3) were not contained therein. for this purpose, the parties confirm their view that, under present law, bmg will, after the effective time (as defined in the combination agreement), own a controlling interest in hemlo, within the meaning of code section 897(c)(5) and treasury regulation section 1.897-2(e)(3), by virtue of code section 318(a)(4), without regard to the number of exchangeable shares which, from time to time, have been exchanged for bmg common stock. 5. obligations limited by securities laws. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 1 or 2 hereof, bmg shall have no obligation to disclose any information to holder pursuant to this agreement if and to the extent that bmg determines, in its reasonable good faith judgment after consultation with legal counsel, that such disclosure would constitute a violation of any federal, state or provincial securities law. holder hereby acknowledges that it is aware that if holder receives material non-public information pursuant to this agreement, then federal, state or provincial securities laws may restrict holder from purchasing or selling securities of bmg or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance on such information. 6. notices. any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by either party hereto to the other party shall be in writing and delivered personally, by telecopy (with confirmation sent within three business days by overnight courier or certified mail, postage prepaid), overnight courier, or certified mail, postage prepaid to: if to holder: noranda inc. 181

manner provided above shall be deemed to have been given upon actual receipt by the party to whom it is directed (evidenced, in the case of telecopy, by the receipt of the correct answerback). 7. further assurances. the parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further information, and (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents, in each case, as the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this agreement. 8. information concerning ownership by holder. holder agrees to furnish to bmg at any time and from time to time such information concerning the ownership by holder of exchangeable shares and shares of bmg common stock as bmg may request in writing, including information necessary to calculate the ownership by holder of exchangeable shares and bmg common stock for purposes of section 9 hereof and for any purpose relevant under the plan of arrangement (including the exchangeable share provisions set forth therein) and the voting, support and exchange trust agreement. such information shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such request. if holder fails to provide any such information within thirty days after such a written request by bmg, bmg may assume for all purposes, including those just described, that such holder no longer owns any exchangeable shares or shares of bmg common stock, other than that number of exchangeable shares or shares of bmg common stock, as the case may be, reported as owned by such holder in any filing pursuant to applicable united states or canadian provincial securities laws. holder agrees to notify bmg if holder ceases to own a number of the exchangeable shares which the holder acquired in the arrangement in excess of, or equal to, the minimum number (as defined in the combination agreement). for all purposes of this agreement (1) ownership shall mean beneficial ownership within the contemplation of section 897 of the code and (2) the constructive ownership rules of section 897(c)(6)(c) of the code shall apply, except that the holder shall not be deemed to own exchangeable shares by virtue of owning bmg common stock. 9. termination. this agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect one year following the date on which the number of (1) the exchangeable shares acquired by holder in the arrangement (as defined in the combination agreement) plus (2) the shares of bmg common stock which holder has received in exchange for exchangeable shares acquired by holder in the arrangement which, in each case, holder continues to have ownership of, does not exceed the minimum number. 10. exercise of retraction right. no later than seven (7) days prior to the date on which holder intends to deliver a retraction request (as defined in the exchangeable share provisions attached as exhibit a to the plan of arrangement entered into pursuant to the combination agreement), holder shall provide bmg with written notice (a "holder notice") of its intention to deliver such retraction request, together with a statement updating to the date of such notice the most recent information provided by holder to bmg pursuant to section 8 hereof. within seven (7) days from the date of the holder notice, bmg shall notify holder in writing as to whether or not it intends to exercise its retraction call right (as defined in the exchangeable share provisions) (a "bmg notice"). if the bmg notice indicates that bmg intends to exercise its retraction call right, the bmg notice shall be accompanied by the officer's certificate (and, if applicable, the opinion of counsel) provided for in the exchangeable share provisions. notwithstanding the foregoing in this section 10, holder shall be entitled to deliver a retraction request without first providing bmg with a holder notice if at the time that holder delivers the retraction request, holder provides bmg with a written waiver of the limitation on bmg's right to exercise its retraction call right set forth in section 6.3 of the exchangeable share provisions. 11. entire agreement and modification. this agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. this agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment. 12. severability. if any provision of this agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this agreement will remain in full force and effect. any provision of this agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. 13. section headings; construction. the headings of sections in this agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. 14. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. 15. governing law. this agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of new york without regard to its principles pertaining to conflict of laws. in witness whereof, the parties have hereunto set their hands as of the date first above written: noranda inc. by: /s/george m. penna
