amended and restated investment agreement dated as of february 7, 1997, amended as of march 20, 1997 and amended and restated as of may 15, 1997 (the "investment agreement") which is included as exhibit 1 to this statement and is incorporated herein by reference. on page 7 of 27 pages june 24, 1997 (the "closing date"), at the initial closing under the investment agreement (the "closing"), ap-agc acquired 553,475 shares of a new series of preferred stock of the issuer designated 20% cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock, series a ("series a preferred shares") and 1,106,950 warrants to acquire common stock ("warrants") for an aggregate purchase price equal to $5,534,752. on june 30, 1997 (the "subsequent issuance") ap-agc acquired an additional 334,000 series a preferred shares and 668,000 warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $3,340,000. ap-agc obtained the funds required to consummate the closing and the subsequent issuance from apollo fund ii, which obtained such funds from capital contributions from its partners. on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the investment agreement, ap-agc has agreed to purchase from the issuer, and the issuer has agreed to issue to ap-agc, up to 2,500,000 series a preferred shares and, on a pro rata basis, up to 5,000,000 warrants (including those series a preferred shares and warrants acquired at the closing and the subsequent issuance) for an aggregate purchase price of up to $25,000,000. under the investment agreement, the additional series a pre- ferred shares and warrants are to be acquired by ap-agc (on a pro rata basis) as and when appropriate real estate investment opportunities are identified and approved by ap-agc and the board of directors of the issuer (the "issuer's board"). if, page 8 of 27 pages however, the issuer has not presented ap-agc with real estate development projects pursuant to which ap-agc has invested $25,000,000 on the terms and conditions set forth in the investment agreement, ap-agc has the option to acquire such securities at any time. the investment agreement further provides that, if the full $25,000,000 has not been invested by june 30, 1998, the company may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the investment agreement, require ap- agc to invest the remaining amount not yet invested. the funds for making additional acquisitions of series a preferred shares and warrants pursuant to the invest- ment agreement will be contributed to ap-agc by apollo fund ii, which will obtain such funds from its partners. as of the date of this statement, the reporting persons beneficially own an aggregate of 9,347,826 common shares (including 1,543,435 common shares which may be acquired upon the conversion of the 887,475 series a preferred shares currently owned and 1,774,950 common shares which may be acquired upon the exercise of warrants currently owned, as well as common shares which may be acquired upon the conversion of series a preferred shares or the exercise of warrants which are not currently outstanding, but which ap-agc has the right to acquire under the investment agreement.) page 9 of 27 pages item 4. purpose of transaction. the investment ap-agc is making its investment in the issuer because it believes that the acquisition of the series a preferred shares and the warrants is an attractive investment opportu- nity. in accordance with the terms of the investment agree- ment, ap-agc has three nominees on the issuer's seven member board, and ap-agc expects to be involved in and to influence the management and direction of the issuer. the series a preferred shares rank senior to common shares with respect to dividends and distributions. holders of the series a preferred shares are entitled to cash dividends on a quarterly basis at a rate of 20% per annum. in the event cash dividends are not paid, the dividends will accumulate. as described below under certain circumstances, a holder of series a preferred shares may require the issuer to repurchase such shares for a repurchase price equal to their liquidation preference (including accumulated dividends). the holders' rights to receive such repurchase price are secured by a first lien over the issuer's stock in, and the assets of, a newly formed special purpose subsidiary ("sp subsidiary") formed for the purpose of holding and investing the amounts page 10 of 27 pages received from ap-agc and the proceeds thereof, and by a second lien over substantially all the remaining assets of the issuer. as described in item 3 above, on the agreement date, ap-agc and the issuer entered into the investment agreement which is included as an exhibit to this statement and is incor- porated herein by reference. the statement of preferences and rights of the series a preferred shares (the "series a certificate") and the form of warrant are also included as exhibits to this statement and incorporated by reference herein. this description of the investment agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the "transaction") sum- marizes certain material provisions of the investment agreement, the series a certificate, the form of warrant and the transaction and is not intended to be complete, but is qualified throughout by reference to such documents. unless otherwise noted, section references in this statement refer to sections of the investment agreement. in addition, the transaction (including the terms of the series a preferred shares and the warrants) is described in the proxy statement of the issuer dated may 21, 1997 relating to its annual meeting of stockholders for 1997 (the "proxy statement"), which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission. page 11 of 27 pages acquisition of additional securities of the issuer pursuant to the investment agreement, ap-agc has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein set forth, to acquire from the issuer up to an aggregate of 2,500,000 series a preferred shares at a price of $9.88 per share and, on a pro rata basis with the series a preferred shares, up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants at a price of $.06 per warrant (including the series a preferred shares and warrants acquired in the closing), for an aggregate purchase price of up to $25,000,000. the warrants to be acquired by ap-agc are to be divided as nearly as possible into equal numbers of class a, class b and class c warrants which are identical except that they have different minimum exercise prices after the one-time adjustment that may be made to the exercise price. under the investment agreement, the series a preferred shares and war- rants are to be acquired by ap-agc (on a pro rata basis) as and when appropriate real estate investment opportunities are iden- tified and approved by ap-agc and the issuer's board, although, if the issuer has not presented ap-agc with real estate development prospects pursuant to which ap-agc has invested $25,000,000, ap-agc has the option to acquire such securities at any time. the investment agreement further provides that, if the full $25,000,000 has not been invested by june 30, 1998, the company may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the investment agreement, require ap-agc to invest the page 12 of 27 pages remaining amount not yet invested. the investment agreement provides the ap-agc will not be obligated to acquire additional series a preferred shares and warrants if an event of default (as defined, to include certain uncured breaches, material adverse changes, and bankruptcy-related events) shall have occurred and (except in the case of bankruptcy events) be continuing. (sections 2.5(c) and 3.4). at the closing on june 24, 1997, ap-agc acquired 553,475 series a preferred shares and 1,106,950 warrants for an aggregate price of $5,534,752. on june 30, 1997, ap-agc acquired an additional 334,000 series a preferred shares and 668,000 warrants for an aggregate price of $3,340,000. based on the exchange price of $5.75 (which is subject to certain antidilution adjustments), the 2,500,000 series a preferred shares to be issued under the investment agreement are currently convertible into 4,347,826 common shares. based on the warrant exercise price of $5.75 (which is subject to certain antidilution and other adjustments) the 5,000,000 warrants are exercisable for 5,000,000 common shares. if dividends on the series a preferred shares are not paid in cash, but are accrued and added to the liquidation preference, the number of common shares into which the series a preferred shares are convertible shall increase accordingly. page 13 of 27 pages the reporting persons do not intend to amend or sup- plement this statement to reflect additional issuances of series a preferred shares and warrants under the investment agreement up to the amount disclosed as beneficially owned on this statement. disposition of issuer securities under the investment agreement, ap-agc is not permit- ted to transfer its series a preferred shares or warrants (or common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof, respectively) for a period of two years from the agreement date, although these restrictions lapse in certain events, including certain events of default under the investment agree- ment or certain change in control events. (section 6.1.) the issuer may redeem the series a preferred shares at any time or on after june 24, 2000, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to their liquidation preference ( which includes the compounded value of accumulated dividends). (see section 5 of the series a certificate, which is attached hereto as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference). except as described in the following sentence, the series a preferred shares are not redeemable at the option of any holder thereof prior to june 24, 2001; provided that after that date a holder may require the issuer to repurchase from it page 14 of 27 pages (i) prior to june 23, 2002 up to one-third of the total number of series a preferred shares issued, (ii) prior to june 24, 2003 up to two-thirds of the total number of series a preferred shares issued and (iii) after june 24, 2003, all of its series a preferred shares. a holder's right to require the issuer to repurchase its series a preferred shares will be accelerated and immediately exercisable in the case of certain events of default by the issuer, including certain payment defaults, cer- tain change of control events, certain bankruptcy-related events and certain material breaches of the investment agree- ment (in particular of covenants relating to the issuer's obli- gation to obtain ap-agc's consent to engage in certain major transactions, as described below). (see section 8 of the series a certificate.) the investment agreement grants certain registration rights to the holders of series a preferred shares and common shares issuable upon the conversion of series a preferred shares or upon the exercise of warrants, including demand registration rights, "piggyback" registration rights and the right to require the issuer to register such securities on a "shelf" registration statement for continuous resale (article viii). page 15 of 27 pages ap-agc may decide to dispose of some or all of its securities of the issuer to the extent permitted by the invest- ment agrement. changes in issuer's board in accordance with the investment agreement and the series a certificate, the issuer's board has been reduced to seven directors. the series a certificate provides that designees of the series a preferred shares are entitled to elect three of the seven directors. pursuant to the investment agreement as originally executed on february 7, 1997, one designee of ap-agc was elected to the issuer's board in february 1997. contemporaneously with the closing, nine of the eleven incumbent members of the issuer's board (including the original ap-agc designee) resigned, the size of the board was reduced to seven directors and three designees of the holders of the series a preferred shares and two new independent directors were appointed. information regarding the ap-agc-nominated directors and the other changes made to the issuer's board in connection with the transactions contemplated by the investment agreement, see the proxy statement. ap-agc may at any time cause any of its nominees to the issuer's board to resign or be removed, and may replace such resigning or removed director with a designee of its election. page 16 of 27 pages in accordance with the series a certificate, the three directors to be nominated by the holders of the series a preferred shares shall have terms of office of one year, al- though the other four directors of the company shall be classi- fied into three classes and have terms of office of three years each. if ap-agc holds fewer than 500,000 series a preferred shares, the number of directors elected by the holders of series a preferred shares may be reduced if the number of out- standing series a preferred shares is reduced. the issuer's charter and bylaws were amended to implement the changes to the issuer's board described above. designees of the holders of series a preferred shares currently serve on all of the committees of the issuer's board and form a majority of certain of such committees. major transactions the investment agreement provides that so long as ap-agc holds at least 500,000 series a preferred shares, the issuer shall not, except with the prior written approval of ap-agc, engage in, or enter into any agreement with respect to, or resolve to engage in or to enter into any agreement with respect to, any major transaction, including "any material transaction which is not described in an approved business plan, including any (i) recapitalization, redemption or page 17 of 27 pages reclassification of, or distribution or dividend on, the com- pany's capital stock, (ii) amendment of its certificate of in- corporation or by-laws, (iii) liquidation, winding-up or dis- solution of the company or any significant subsidiary (as de- fined in sec regulation s-x) of the company, (iv) consolidation of the company with, or merger of the company with or into, any other person, except a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company into the company, with the company surviving such merger, (v) sale, transfer, lease or encumbrance by the company or any subsidiary of a significant amount of assets of the com- pany other than in respect of sales of predecessor assets (as referred to in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 1995), (vi) special dividend or distribution with respect to, or repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of, equity securities of the company or any rights, warrants or options in respect of such equity secu- rities, (vii) capital expenditure or investment by the company or any subsidiary in excess of $500,000, (viii) entering into or materially amending (including by waiver) any material con- tract, (ix) significant new financing or refinancing, (x) issuance of securities (other than employee and director stock options to acquire up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock and the issuance of the common stock thereunder), (xi) transactions which would result in a change of control, (xii) material transaction the nature of which prevents specificity in the page 18 of 27 pages approved business plan or (xiii) commencement, undertaking or acquisition of a real estate development project by sp subsid- iary (whether independently, by joint venture or otherwise) and related financing or joint venture arrangements. . ." by virtue of its representation on the issuer's board, its power to veto major transactions and its right to require the issuer to repurchase its series a preferred shares, in the case of certain material breaches of the investment agreement, ap-agc expects to be able to influence the management and direction of the issuer. because ap-agc's consent would be required for any transaction which would result in a change in control of the issuer and certain changes in control would permit the holders of series a preferred shares and series b preferred shares (as defined below) to require the issuer to repurchase such securities at their liquidation preference (including accumulated dividends), the transactions effected and to be effected pursuant to the investment agreement are likely to impede the acquisition of control of the issuer and to discourage third parties from attempting to acquire control of the issuer. on the closing date, the issuer also sold to certain investors in a private placement 1,776,199 common shares, 1,000,000 shares of a new series of preferred stock designated page 19 of 27 pages its 20% cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock, series b ("series b preferred shares") and 2,000,000 warrants to purchase common shares. the series b preferred shares are substantially similar to the series a preferred shares, except that the holders of series b preferred shares will not be entitled to elect any directors of the issuer and will not have consent rights with respect to major transactions, and that the repurchase obligations of the company will not be secured. further information regarding the terms of the series b pre- ferred shares is contained in the proxy statement. the investment agreement contemplates that the issuer will offer up to 1,000,000 series b preferred shares and 2,000,000 warrants to purchase common shares to its shareholders in a rights offering. the warrants to purchase common shares issued in the private placement and to be issued in the rights offering will be substantially similar to the warrants, except for certain differences necessitated by the broader holding of such war- rants. amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the transaction, the issuer's share- holders approved at their annual meeting held on june 23, 1997, an amended and restated certificate of incorporation (which included the series a certificate, the statement of preferences and rights of the series b preferred shares and certain other page 20 of 27 pages changes) and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective on june 24, 1997 when it was filed with the secretary of state of delaware. these changes were necessary to facilitate the transaction and included the elimination of certain dividend preferences out of available cash-flow in favor of the common shares, the elimination of a prohibition on non-voting stock and an increase in the autho- rized amount of common shares. for further details concerning the amended and restated certificate of incorporation see the proxy statement. other plans or proposals the investment agreement also provides that ap-agc will have certain "first look" rights to participate with issuer in new joint venture community development projects pro- posed to be entered into by the issuer, until ap-agc has in- vested $60,000,000 in such projects (section 6.12). except as set forth in this statement (including the exhibits incorporated by reference herein), the reporting per- sons have no present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions described in item 4(a) through (j) of schedule 13d under rule 13d-1(a). depending upon prevailing economic and investment considerations and other factors that the reporting persons may deem relevant, the reporting persons may purchase or sell common shares or other page 21 of 27 pages securities of the issuer in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, or engage in any other transaction they deem appropriate. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) as of the date of this statement, the reporting persons beneficially own an aggregate of 9,347,826 common shares (including 1,543,435 common shares which may be acquired upon the conversion of the 887,475 series a preferred shares currently owned and 1,774,950 common shares which may be acquired upon the exercise of warrants currently owned, as well as common shares which may be acquired upon the conversion of series a preferred shares or the exercise of warrants which ap-agc has the right to acquire at any time under the investment agreement.) (b) for purposes of section 13 of the act, apollo fund ii may be deemed to control ap-agc, area ii may be deemed to control apollo fund ii and capital advisers ii may be deemed to control area ii. each of the reporting persons may thus be considered to beneficially own and to have sole voting and dis- positive power with respect to all the common shares held of record by ap-agc. (c) except as set forth above, there have been no purchases or sales by any of the reporting persons of common page 22 of 27 pages shares during the last 60 days. to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, no person identified on annex a has effected any transactions in common shares during the past 60 days. (d) no other person is known by the reporting per- sons to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the common shares beneficially owned by the reporting persons. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relation- ships with respect to securities of the issuer. aside from the investment agreement and the related documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, as de- scribed in item 3 and item 4 above, the reporting persons know of no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships required to be described herein. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1: amended and restated investment agreement dated as of february 7, 1997, amended as of march 20, 1997 and amended and restated as of may 15,

reimbursed by the company and without limiting the obligation -81- of the company to do so) from and against any and all liabili- ties, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judg- ments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time follow- ing the payment of the secured instrument) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against collateral agent in any way relating to or arising out of this agreement, any of the other transaction documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by collateral agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that the obligee shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from collateral agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. the agreements in this section shall survive the payment of the secured instrument and all other amounts payable hereunder. 9.10 [intentionally omitted] 9.11 [intentionally omitted] 9.12 successor collateral agent. collateral agent may resign as collateral agent, upon 30 days' notice to the obligee. if collateral agent shall resign as collateral agent under this agreement and the other transaction documents, then the obligee shall appoint a successor collateral agent for the obligee, which successor collateral agent, except if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be approved by the company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), whereupon, effective upon acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of collateral agent and the term "collateral agent" shall mean such successor collateral agent, and the former collateral agent's rights, powers and duties as collateral agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former collateral agent or any of the parties to this agreement or any holder of the secured instrument. if the obligee fails to appoint a successor collateral agent for the obligee as provided above within 30 days after the resignation of collateral agent, then collateral agent may appoint a successor collateral agent for the obligee, which successor collateral agent, except if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be approved by the company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), whereupon, effective upon acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of collateral agent and the -82- term "collateral agent" shall mean such successor collateral agent and the former collateral agent's rights, powers and duties as collateral agent, as the case may be, shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former collateral agent or any of the parties to this agreement or any holder of the secured instrument. after any retiring collateral agent's resignation as collateral agent, the provisions of this section 9 shall inure and survive to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken (or any matter related thereto) by it while it was collateral agent under this agreement and the other transaction documents. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the resignation of collateral agent shall not be effective unless and until a successor collateral agent has been appointed and has accepted such appointment. section 10.

except with the prior written consent of the obligee. no such amendment, supplement or modification shall amend, modify or waive any provision of section 9 without the written consent of then collateral agent affected thereby. any such waiver of a default or event of default in accordance with the terms hereof and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall be binding upon the company, the obligee, collateral agent and all future holders of the secured instrument. in the case of any waiver, the company, the obligee, and collateral agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding secured instrument and any other transaction documents, and any default or event of default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 10.2 notices. all notices, requests and demands to or upon

contribution among subsidiaries. (a) anything contained in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each subsidiary hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under section 548 of title 11 of the united states code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the "fraudulent transfer laws"), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such subsidiary, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the fraudulent transfer laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such subsidiary (i) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to company or other affiliates of company to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such subsidiary hereunder and (ii) under any guaranty of subordinated indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this subsection 11.3(a), pursuant to which the liability of such subsidiary hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the ap- plicable provisions of the fraudulent transfer laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or con- tribution of such subsidiary pursuant to applicable law or pur- suant to any agreement. (b) the co-makers under this agreement and each guarantor under any subsidiary guaranty together desire to allocate among themselves (collectively, the "contributing parties"), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this agreement and the subsidiary guaranties. accordingly, if any payment or distribution is made on any date by any co-maker under this agreement or a guarantor under a subsidiary guaranty (a "funding party") that exceeds its fair share (as defined below) as of such date, that funding party shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other contributing parties in the amount of such contributing party's fair share shortfall (as defined below) as of such date, with the result that all such contributions will cause each contributing party's aggregate payments (as defined below) to equal its fair share as of such date. "fair share" means, with respect to a contributing party as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the adjusted maximum amount (as defined below) with respect to such contributing party to (y) the aggregate of the adjusted maximum amounts with respect to all contributing parties, multiplied by -95- (ii) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all funding parties under this agreement and the subsidiary guaranties in respect of the secured obligations. "fair share shortfall" means, with respect to a contributing party as of any date of determination, the excess, if any, of the fair share of such contributing party over the aggregate payments of such contributing party. "adjusted maximum amount" means, with respect to a contributing party as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such contributing party under this agreement and the subsidiary guaranties, determined as of such date in accordance with subsection 11.3(a) or, if applicable, a similar provision in the subsidiary guaranties; provided that, solely for purposes of calculating the adjusted maximum amount with respect to any contributing party for purposes of this subsection 11.3(b), any assets or liabilities of such contributing party arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification or any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder or under any similar provision in a subsidiary guaranty shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of such contributing party. "aggregate payments" means, with respect to a contributing party as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (i) the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or before such date by such contributing party in respect of this agreement and the subsidiary guaranties (including, without limitation, in respect of this subsection 11.3(b) or any similar provision contained in a subsidiary guaranty) minus (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments received on or before such date by such contributing party from the other contributing parties as contributions under this subsection 11.3(b) or any similar provision contained in any subsidiary guaranty. the amounts payable as contributions hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the applicable funding party. the allocation among contributing parties of their obligations as set forth in this subsection 11.3(b) or any similar provision contained in a subsidiary guaranty shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any contributing party hereunder or under a subsidiary guaranty or to entitle any funding party or contributing party to fail or refuse to make a payment to obligee otherwise required hereunder or under a subsidiary guaranty. without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the failure of any funding party to receive a contribution from contributing parties in the amount of their respective fair share shortfalls shall not excuse payment by it of obligations to obligee hereunder or under a subsidiary guarantee or constitute a defense or offset to payment of such obligations and no party shall pay its fair share shortfall to a funding party before obligee has received payment of all sums -96- due to it from such party. each contributing party under a subsidiary guaranty is a third-party beneficiary to the contribution agreement set forth in this subsection 11.3(b). the obligations of any party under a subsidiary guaranty are not secured by any mortgages made by the co-makers and recorded in florida, which mortgages secure the direct obligations of the co-makers rather than guaranties of the obligations of others. 11.4 liability of co-makers absolute. each co-maker agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, abso- lute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable dis- charge of a co-maker other than indefeasible payment in full of the secured obligations. in furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each co-maker agrees as follows: (a) the obligation of each co-maker is independent, primary and original, and not dependent upon failure of obligee to collect from any other co-maker. (b) obligee may enforce this agreement against the subsidiaries notwithstanding the existence of any dispute be- tween obligee and company or any subsidiary with respect to the existence of an event of default. (c) the obligations of each subsidiary hereunder are independent of the obligations of company under the trans- action documents and the obligations of any other co-maker or any guarantor, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such subsidiary whether or not any ac- tion is brought against company or any of such other co-makers or guarantor and whether or not company is joined in any such action or actions. (d) payment by any co-maker of a portion, but not all, of the secured obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any other co-maker's liability for any por- tion of the secured obligations which has not been paid. with- out limiting the generality of the foregoing, if obligee is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any co- maker's covenant to pay a portion of the secured obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such co-maker from its covenant to pay the portion of the secured obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such co-maker, limit, affect, modify or abridge any other co-maker's liability hereunder in respect of the secured obligations. -97- (e) obligee, upon such terms as it deems appropri- ate, without notice or demand and without affecting the valid- ity or enforceability of this agreement or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any co-maker's liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the secured obligations, (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the secured obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) re- quest and accept guaranties of the secured obligations and take and hold security for the payment of this agreement or the se- cured obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substi- tute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the secured obligations, any guaranties of the secured obli- gations, or any other obligation of any person (including any other co-maker) with respect to the secured obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of obligee in respect of this agreement or the se- cured obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that obligee may have against any such security, as obligee in its discretion may determine consistent with this agreement and any applicable security agreement or mortgage, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commer- cially reasonable, and even though such action operates to im- pair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any co-maker against any other co- maker or any security for the secured obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the transaction documents. (f) this agreement and the obligations of the co- makers hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than indefeasible payment in full of the secured obligations), including the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any co-maker shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce, or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforce- ment of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the transaction documents, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the secured obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any guaranty -98- of or security for the payment of the secured obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (in- cluding provisions relating to events of default) of this agreement, any of the other transaction documents or any agree- ment or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any guar- anty or security for the secured obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms of the agreement or such transaction document or any agreement relating to such guaranty or security; (iii) the secured obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be il- legal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the ap- plication of payments received from any source (other than pay- ments received pursuant to the other transaction documents or from the proceeds of any security for the secured obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the secured obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the secured obligations, even though obligee might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the secured obligations; (v) obligee's con- sent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corpo- rate structure or existence of company or any of its subsidiar- ies and to any corresponding restructuring of the secured obli- gations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any collateral which secures any of the secured obligations; (vii) any defenses, setoffs or counter- claims which any co-maker may allege or assert against obligee in respect of the secured obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any co-maker as an obligor in respect of the secured obligations. 11.5 waivers by co-maker. each co-maker hereby waives, for the benefit of obligee: (a) any right to require obligee, as a condition of payment or performance by such co-maker, to (i) proceed against company, any subsidiary or any guarantor of the secured obligations or any other person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from company, any other subsidiary or any guarantor of the secured obligations or any other person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of obligee in favor of company or any other person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of obligee whatsoever; -99- (b) any defense arising by reason of the incapac- ity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of any co-maker including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the secured obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of any co-maker from any cause other than indefeasible payment in full of the secured obligations; (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a co-maker must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of any other obligor; (d) any defense based upon obligee's errors or omissions in the administration of the secured obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statu- tory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this agreement or which result or might result in any legal or equitable discharge of such co-maker's obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations af- fecting such co-maker's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to setoffs, recoupments and counter- claims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that obligee protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, no- tices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this agreement, notices of default under this agreement or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modifica- tion of the secured obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any other co- maker and notices of any of the matters referred to in subsec- tion 11.4 and any right to consent to any thereof; and (g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exoner- ate co-makers, guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this agreement. 11.6 payment by subsidiaries; application of payments. subject to the provisions of subsection 11.3(a), the subsidiar- ies hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which obligee or any other person may have at law or in equity against any subsidiary by virtue hereof, that upon the failure -100- of company to pay any of the secured obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under section 362(a) of the bankruptcy code, 11 u.s.c. section 362(a)), the subsidiaries will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to obligee, an amount equal to all secured obligations then due as aforesaid, including accrued and unpaid interest on such secured obligations (including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to company, would have accrued on such secured obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against company for such interest in any such bankruptcy proceeding) and all other secured obligations then owed to obligee as aforesaid. all such payments shall be applied promptly from time to time by obligee in accordance with this agreement. 11.7 co-makers' rights of subrogation, contribution, etc. each co-maker hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such co-maker now has or may hereafter have against any other co-maker or any of its assets in connection with this agreement or the performance by such co-maker of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including without limitation (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such co-maker now has or may hereafter have against company, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that obligee now has or may hereafter have against any other co-maker, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by obligee. in addition, until the secured obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full, each co- maker shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such co-maker may have against any guarantor of the secured obliga- tions (including any such right of contribution under any guar- anty). each co-maker further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subroga- tion, reimbursement or indemnification such co-maker may have against any other co-maker or against any collateral or secu- rity, and any rights of contribution such co-maker may have against any such guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights obligee may have against company and the other co- makers, to all right, title and interest obligee may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right obligee may have against such guarantor. if any amount shall be paid to -101- any co-maker on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all secured obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for obligee and shall forthwith be paid over to obligee to be credited and applied against the secured obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof. 11.8 subordination of other obligations. any indebted- ness of any co-maker now or hereafter held by any other co-- maker is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the obliga- tions of such indebted co-maker in respect of the secured obli- gations, and any such indebtedness of a co-maker to another co- maker collected or received by such other co-maker after an event of default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for obligee and shall forthwith be paid over to obligee to be credited and applied against the secured obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of any co-maker under any other provision of this agreement. 11.9 expenses. co-makers jointly and severally agree to pay, or cause to be paid, on demand, and to save obligee harm- less against liability for, any and all costs and expenses (in- cluding reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and al- located costs of internal counsel) incurred or expended by obligee in connection with the enforcement of, or preservation of any rights under, this agreement. 11.10 continuing agreement. this agreement shall remain in effect as against each co-maker until all of the secured obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full. each co-maker hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this agreement as to future transactions giving rise to any secured obligations. 11.11 authority of the co-makers. it is not necessary for obligee to inquire into the capacity or powers of any co- maker or the officers, directors or any agents acting or pur- porting to act on behalf of any of them. 11.12 financial condition of the company. any secured obligations may be incurred by company or continued from time to time without notice to or authorization from any subsidiary regardless of the financial or other condition of company at the time of any such grant or continuation. the obligee shall have no obligation to disclose or discuss with any subsidiary its assessment, or any subsidiary's assessment, of the finan- cial condition of company. each subsidiary has adequate means -102- to obtain information from company on a continuing basis con- cerning the financial condition of company and its ability to perform its obligations under the transaction documents, and each subsidiary assumes the responsibility for being and keep- ing informed of the financial condition of company and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the se- cured obligations. each subsidiary hereby waives and relin- quishes any duty on the part of obligee to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or condi- tions of company now known or hereafter known by lender. 11.13 rights cumulative. the rights, powers and remedies given to obligee by this agreement are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all rights, powers and rem- edies given to obligee by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the other transaction documents or any agreement between any subsidiary and obligee or between company and obligee. any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay by obligee in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be con- strued to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the fur- ther exercise of any such right, power or remedy. 11.14 bankruptcy; post-petition interest; reinstatement of agreement. (a) so long as any secured obligations remain out- standing, no co-maker shall, without the prior written consent of obligee in accordance with the agreement, commence or join with any other person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganiza- tion or insolvency proceedings of or against any other co- maker. the obligations of the co-makers under this agreement shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or invol- untary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any other or by any defense which any other co-maker may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding. (b) each co-maker acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the secured obligations which ac- crues after the commencement of any proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the secured obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the secured obligations if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be included in the secured obligations because it is the intention of co-makers and obligee that the secured obligations of each co-maker -103- pursuant to this agreement should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve any other co- maker of any portion of such secured obligations. the co- makers will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay obligee, or allow the claim of obligee in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such proceeding is commenced. (c) if all or any portion of the secured obliga- tions is paid by any co-maker, the obligations of the other co- makers hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from obligee as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so re- scinded or recovered shall constitute secured obligations for all purposes under this agreement. 11.15 setoff. in addition to any other rights obligee may have under law or in equity, if any amount shall at any time be due and owing by any co-maker to obligee under this agreement, obligee is authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice (any such notice being hereby expressly waived), to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (gen- eral or special, including but not limited to indebtedness evi- denced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unma- tured) and any other indebtedness of obligee owing to such co- maker and any other property of such co-maker held by obligee to or for the credit or the account of such co-maker against and on account of the secured obligations and liabilities of such co-maker to obligee under this agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to excluded property and the restricted bank accounts identified in schedule 7.17 of this agreement. section 12. miscellaneous 12.1 acknowledgment regarding certain environmental obli- gations. each subsidiary hereby acknowledges and agrees that the secured obligations includes company's obligation under this agreement to comply with the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 and all other environmental laws and to indemnify and hold harmless obligee and collateral agent from and against any and all liability arising out of, or in connection with the presence of hazardous materials at any property of company or any subsidiary given as security for the secured obligations, and each subsidiary hereby expressly undertakes as co-maker the payment, -104- performance and discharge of such obligations and liabilities of company. remainder of page left intentionally blank -105- in witness whereof, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to be duly executed and
