(a) pursuant to the stockholders agreement, triarc has the contractual right to require the stockholders to vote their shares of subject stock in the manner set forth in the stockholders agreement. in the event that a stockholder fails to vote his shares of subject stock in such manner, each stockholder has appointed triarc as his or page 5 of 7 pages her attorney and proxy to vote his or her shares of subject stock in the manner set forth in the stockholders agreement. in addition, each stockholder has granted to triarc an exclusive and irrevocable option (collectively, the "options") to purchase his subject stock if the company shall have taken certain specified actions with respect to an acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), at a purchase price per share in cash equal to (i) 0.1722 times (ii) the average (without rounding) of the closing prices per share of triarc common stock on the new york stock exchange for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the closing of the exercise of the option, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the stockholders agreement. the options granted under the stockholders agreement must be exercised by triarc simultaneously in whole and not in part. as of the date of this schedule 13d, there are 1,763,609 shares of subject common stock, or approximately 19.7% of the common stock outstanding.(1) in addition, the stockholders hold vested options to purchase 185,000 shares of common stock (collectively, the "stockholder options"). assuming that all such the stockholder options are exercised, the shares of common stock so acquired would be subject stock under the stockholders agreement with respect to which triarc would have the right to direct the vote with respect to the merger, be appointed proxy and hold an option to acquire as described in the previous paragraph. triarc believes that it may be deemed to have shared voting power and shared dispositive power with respect to an aggregate of 1,948,609 shares of common stock, or approximate 21.3% of the outstanding common stock.(2) triarc is reporting this 21.3% figure solely for the purpose of establishing how many shares of common stock with respect to which triarc may be deemed to have shared voting power and shared dispositive power under the stockholders agreement, and such figure should not be relied upon for any other purposes. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this schedule 13d, and in accordance with rule 13d-4 promulgated under the act, the filing of this schedule 13d shall not be construed as an admission that triarc is the beneficial owner of such shares. (b) pursuant to the stockholders agreement triarc has shared power with the stockholders to vote or to direct the vote, and to dispose of or direct the disposition of, the subject stock as set forth in the stockholders agreement. (c) except as described herein, in the merger agreement or in the stockholders agreement, triarc has not engaged in any transaction involving common stock within the sixty (60) day period immediately preceding the date of this schedule 13d and, except for the shares of subject stock described above which are subject to the stockholders agreement, triarc does not beneficially own any common stock. paragraphs (d) and (e) of item 5 of schedule 13d are not applicable to this filing. - -------------- (1) such percentage is based on 8,948,324 shares of common stock outstanding as of june 24, 1997 as represented by the company in the merger agreement. (2) such percentage is based on 8,948,324 shares of common stock outstanding, plus an additional 185,000 shares issued upon exercise of the stockholder options. page 6 of 7 pages item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except as described in items 3 and 4 above, triarc is not a party to any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with respect to any securities of the company. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. sequentially exhibit schedule numbered page a. agreement and plan of

upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware (the "dgcl"). the parent and mergerco are unwilling to enter into this agreement unless certain stockholders of the company enter into a stockholders agreement (the "stockholders agreement") among the parent, mergerco and such stockholders providing for, among other things, the granting to the parent and mergerco of the right to vote shares of company common stock owned by such stockholders under the circumstances set forth in such agreement and the granting to parent and mergerco of an option to purchase such shares of company common stock owned by such stockholders under the circumstances and at the price set forth in such agreement, and the board of directors of the company has approved the parent and mergerco entering into the stockholders agreement. the board of directors of the company, having received advice from montgomery securities, its investment advisor, and an opinion from such firm to the effect 1 that the consideration to be received by the stockholders of the company pursuant to the merger is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view (the "company fairness opinion"), has approved the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the stockholders agreement (the "contemplated transactions") in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl ("section 203") and has resolved to recommend the approval of the merger by the holders of shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the company (the "company common stock"). for united states federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger provided for herein shall qualify as a reorganization

covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows (capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in section 8.1): article i the merger section 1.1 the

surviving 2 corporation in the merger (the "surviving corporation"), shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the state of delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent. the merger shall have the effects set forth in section 259 of the dgcl. section 1.2 closing. the closing of the merger (the "closing") shall take place at the offices of paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton &

in article vi hereof shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with this agreement and applicable law or at such other time, date and/or place as the company, the parent and mergerco may agree (the "closing date"). subject to the provisions of article vii hereof, failure to consummate the merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this section 1.2 shall not result in the termination of this agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligations hereunder. section 1.3 certificate of incorporation. the certificate of incorporation of the company as in effect immediately prior to the effective time (the "certificate of incorporation") shall be amended in its entirety as set forth in exhibit a hereto, and such certificate of incorporation, as so amended at

car beverage corporation." section 1.5 board of directors and officers.
