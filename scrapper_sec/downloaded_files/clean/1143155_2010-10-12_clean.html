provided , that if more than one subsection of this section 13 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this section 13 so as to result in duplication: (a) stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations . if the company shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its common stock in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the warrantholder after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of common stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of common stock subject to this warrant after such date had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date. in such event, the exercise price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment and (2) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. (b) certain issuances of common shares or convertible securities . if the company shall issue shares of common stock (or rights or warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) (collectively, &#147; convertible securities &#148;, and, such transaction, a &#147; common stock issuance &#148;), other than in permitted transactions (as defined below) or a transaction to which subsection (a) of this section 13 is applicable, without consideration or at a consideration per share of common stock (or having a conversion price per share of common stock) that is less than the then applicable exercise price, then: -9- (1) the exercise price shall be adjusted to equal the consideration per share of common stock received by the company in connection with the common stock issuance; and (2) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant immediately prior to the common stock issuance (the &#147; initial number &#148;) shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the initial number by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the common stock issuance and (b) the denominator of which shall be the consideration per share of common stock received by the company in connection with the common stock issuance. for purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by the company in connection with a common stock issuance shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the net offering price (including the fair market value of any non-cash consideration and before deduction of any related expenses payable to third parties) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such convertible securities into shares of common stock; and &#147; permitted transactions &#148; shall mean issuances (i) as consideration for or to fund the acquisition of businesses and/or related assets at fair market value, (ii) in connection with employee benefit plans and compensation related arrangements in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice approved by the board of directors, (iii) in connection with a public or broadly marketed offering and sale of common stock or convertible securities for cash conducted by the company or its affiliates pursuant to registration under the securities act or rule 144a thereunder on a basis consistent with capital raising transactions by comparable financial institutions and (iv) in connection with the exercise of preemptive rights on terms existing as of the issue date. any adjustment made pursuant to this section 13(b) shall become effective immediately upon the date of such issuance. (c) other distributions . in case the company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its common stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding ordinary cash dividends, dividends of its common stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in section 13(a)), in each such case, the exercise price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the market price of the common stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the common stock trades regular way on the principal national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of common stock (such amount and/or fair market value, the &#147; per share fair market value &#148;) divided by (y) such market price on such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. in such event, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. in the case of adjustment for a cash -10- dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the per share fair market value would be reduced by the per share amount of the portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an ordinary cash dividend. in the event that such distribution is not so made, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board of directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the exercise price that would then be in effect and the number of shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this warrant if such record date had not been fixed. (d) certain repurchases of common stock . in case the company effects a pro rata repurchase of common stock, then the exercise price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the effective date of such pro rata repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such pro rata repurchase and (y) the market price of a share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the company or any of its affiliates of the intent to effect such pro rata repurchase, minus (ii) the aggregate purchase price of the pro rata repurchase, and of which the denominator shall be the product of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such pro rata repurchase minus the number of shares of common stock so repurchased and (b) the market price per share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the company or any of its affiliates of the intent to effect such pro rata repurchase. in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the pro rata repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. for the avoidance of doubt, no increase to the exercise price or decrease in the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be made pursuant to this section 13(d). (e) business combinations . in case of any business combination or reclassification of common stock (other than a reclassification of common stock referred to in section 13(a)), the warrantholder&#146;s right to receive shares upon exercise of this warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) which the common stock issuable (at the time of such business combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such business combination or reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such business combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to the warrantholder&#146;s right to exercise this warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property pursuant to this paragraph. in determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise of this warrant following the consummation of such business combination, if the holders of common stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such business combination, then the consideration that the warrantholder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority -11- of all holders of the shares of common stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). (f) rounding of calculations; minimum adjustments . all calculations under this section 13 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. any provision of this section 13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of common stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of common stock, or more. (g) timing of issuance of additional common stock upon certain adjustments . in any case in which the provisions of this section 13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the warrantholder of this warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock; provided , however , that the company upon request shall deliver to such warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such warrantholder&#146;s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (h) other events . for so long as the warrantholder holds this warrant or any portion thereof, if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this section 13 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the board of directors shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the board of directors, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable shall not be adjusted in the event of a change in the par value of the common stock or a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the company. (i) statement regarding adjustments . whenever the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in section 13, the company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the exercise price that shall be in effect and the number of shares into which this warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each warrantholder at the address appearing in the company&#146;s records. -12- (j) notice of adjustment event . in the event that the company shall propose to take any action of the type described in this section 13 (but only if the action of the type described in this section 13 would result in an adjustment in the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this warrant), the company shall give notice to the warrantholder, in the manner set forth in section 13(i), which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take place. such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the exercise price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this warrant. in the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action. (k) proceedings prior to any action requiring adjustment . as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this section 13, the company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, new york stock exchange, nasdaq stock market or other applicable national securities exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of common stock that the warrantholder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this warrant pursuant to this section 13. (l) adjustment rules . any adjustments pursuant to this section 13 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur. (m) other transactions . notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of doubt, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall not be subject to adjustment pursuant to this section 13 as a result of the consummation of the investment, the other private placements, the tarp exchange, the exchange offers and the rights offering (all as defined in the investment agreements), in each case, at a stated price per share of common stock equal to the purchase price (as defined in the investment agreements). 14. exchange . at any time following the date on which the shares of common stock of the company are no longer listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange (other than in connection with any business combination), the warrantholder may cause the company to exchange all or a portion of this warrant for an economic interest or security (to be determined by the warrantholder after consultation with the company) of the company classified as permanent equity under u.s. gaap having a value equal to the fair market value of the portion of the warrant so exchanged. the warrantholder shall calculate any fair market value required to be calculated pursuant to this section 14, which shall not be subject to the appraisal procedure. 15. &#091;reserved.&#093;
