(b) during the preparation of the preliminary closing date balance sheet by scanning and the period of any dispute referred to below, buyer shall provide seller and seller's independent accountants full access to the books, records, facilities and employees of the business; provided, however, that any such access shall be allowed only in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business. neither seller nor buyer will engage in any substantive discussions with scanning or its employees regarding preparation of the preliminary closing balance sheet unless the other party is also represented in such discussions. (c) either buyer or seller may dispute the amounts set forth on the preliminary closing date balance sheet, but only on the basis that such amounts were not determined in accordance with the accounting principles or with regard to computational errors; provided, however, that no dispute shall be considered properly raised unless buyer or seller, as the case may be, shall have notified scanning and the other party in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 days of such party's receipt of the preliminary closing date balance sheet. any items not properly disputed by either party within such 30-day period shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. if neither buyer nor seller fails properly to notify scanning and the other party of any such dispute within such 30-day period the preliminary closing date balance sheet shall be deemed to be the "closing date balance sheet." (d) in the event of a dispute with respect to the preliminary closing date balance sheet, buyer and seller shall attempt to resolve their differences and any such resolution shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. if buyer and seller fail to reach a resolution with respect to any disputed item within 10 business days of a party's written notice of dispute to scanning and the other party, buyer and seller - 10 - 18 shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the portland, oregon office of kpmg peat marwick llp or, if such firm is unable to so act, by another internationally recognized accounting firm selected by the portland, oregon office of kpmg peat marwick llp (the "neutral auditors"). the neutral auditors shall be instructed to determine and report to the parties hereto upon such remaining disputed items within 30 days after submission, and such report and determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. the neutral auditors' determination shall be based solely on whether the item in dispute has been accounted for on the preliminary closing date balance sheet in accordance with the accounting principles. the fees and disbursements of the neutral auditors shall be allocated between buyer and seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the neutral auditors that is unsuccessfully disputed by each (as finally determined by the neutral auditors) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. the preliminary closing date balance sheet, as modified by resolution by seller and buyer or by the neutral auditors, shall be the "closing date balance sheet." if disagreements arise with respect to individual items of inclusion and/or exclusion on the preliminary closing balance sheet, the parties agree that the governing principle will be that the purchase price adjustment contemplated by this section is intended to analyze the economic effects of a change in shareholders' equity from december 31, 1995 to the closing date and that such change can only be appropriately measured when the closing balance sheet and audited balance sheet are prepared on a consistent basis. (e) upon determination of the closing date balance sheet, the cash portion of the purchase price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amount equal to the amount by which the shareholder's equity on the closing date balance sheet, as adjusted to exclude accounts receivable represented by discounted notes, deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and indebtedness relating to the industrial revenues bonds (such adjustments being the "pro forma adjustments") is greater or less than the shareholder's equity on the audited balance sheet, as adjusted for the pro-forma adjustments and the removal of cash and cash equivalents and the note receivable, provided that such amount is greater than us $500,000. in the event such amount is not greater than us $500,000, no adjustment shall be made to the cash portion of the purchase price pursuant to this section 1.6. for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the closing date balance sheet shall not include any excluded international liabilities, excluded international assets or any federal, state, foreign or local income taxes against which seller has agreed to indemnify buyer pursuant to section 8.1 hereof. if the cash portion of the purchase price, as adjusted in accordance with this section (the "adjusted cash portion"), is in excess of the - 11 - 19 closing cash payment, buyer shall pay seller such excess, or if the closing cash payment is in excess of the adjusted cash portion, seller shall pay buyer such excess. in either case, such amount shall be payable to buyer or seller, as the case may be, in cash within five business days after the final determination of such amount, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by corestates bank, n.a. as its prime or base rate (calculated on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days elapsed from the closing date until the date of payment). the buyer group and the seller group shall treat any such interest as interest in their respective tax returns. such payment shall be made by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the seller or the buyer, as the case may be, or by wire transfer to a bank account or accounts designated by the seller or buyer, as the case may be. if (a) there is a dispute with respect to the preliminary closing date balance sheet and (b) even if all disputed items were resolved in favor of a party, that party would still be required to make a payment (the "undisputed amount") to the other party under this section 1.6(e), then pending resolution of the disputed items, such party will pay the undisputed amount to the other party. 1.7 allocation of purchase price. the purchase price shall be allocated among the non-compete covenant described in section 6.1(f), the shares, the txcom shares and the txcom rights, the us assets and the international assets (by country) as set forth in exhibit f. for purposes of all taxes (as defined below), buyer and seller agree to report the transactions contemplated in this agreement in a manner consistent with the final allocation under this section 1.7, and agree that neither of them will take any position inconsistent therewith for any tax (as defined below) purposes, unless required to do so pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of section 1313 of the code (as defined below) or an analogous provision under state or local law. 1.8 closing. the closing under this agreement (the "closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the later of (i) july 1, 1996 or (ii) three business days after all conditions contained in this agreement have been satisfied or waived, at the offices of boylan, brown, code, fowler, vigdor & wilson, llp, 2400 chase square, rochester, new york 14604, or at such other time, location or date as the parties shall mutually agree. the date on which the closing occurs is sometimes referred to herein as the "closing date." all transactions at the closing shall be deemed to take place simultaneously at the close of business on the closing date, and no transaction shall be deemed to have been completed and no document or certificate shall be deemed to have been delivered until all transactions are completed and all documents are delivered. - 12 - 20 1.9 deliveries and proceedings at closing. at the closing: (a) deliveries by seller. seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to buyer: (i) a certificate or certificates representing the shares, which certificate shall be properly endorsed for transfer by duly executed stock powers, executed in blank or in favor of buyer and otherwise in a form acceptable for transfer on the books of scanning;

the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements (amounts in thousands) 1. organization and basis of presentation: organization: the accompanying combined financial statements of the data capture group of spectra-physics ab (the company) include the assets and liabilities at historical cost and operating results and cash flows of the data capture group of spectra-physics ab, a swedish manufacturing company. the company consists of the operations, assets and liabilities of the company's sales and manufacturing facilities located in eugene, oregon; its various foreign sales and technical support offices located in the united kingdom, france, germany, italy, australia and japan; and a 60% investment in t.x.c.o.m. sa (txcom). the company designs, manufactures and markets bar code scanners, wireless radio frequency systems and retail automation systems for the use in the worldwide automatic identification and data collection industry. in july 1990, spectra-physics, inc. and its subsidiaries (sp) were acquired by pharos usa, inc., which is indirectly owned by pharos ab (now known as spectra-physics ab). in 1990, sp managed four distinct operating divisions, one of which was the scanning system division. the transaction was recorded using the purchase method of accounting. accordingly, a new basis of accounting was established for the company in 1990 based on an allocation of the purchase price among sp divisions, based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of certain assets, resulting in a purchase price in excess of tangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed of $145,900 (see note 6). basis of presentation: the combined financial statements have been prepared as if the company had operated as an independent stand-alone entity for all periods presented. the company has not had significant borrowings, and there was no allocation of spectra-physics ab consolidated borrowings and related interest expense. the company had engaged in various transactions with spectra-physics ab and its affiliates that are characteristic of a group of companies under common control. throughout the period covered by these combined financial statements, the company participated in spectra-physics ab's centralized cash management system. the company's operational transactions resulted in amounts receivable from and payable to spectra-physics ab which fluctuated over time and such net withdrawals have been presented net in the balance sheet as spectra-physics ab's investment in the company. significant intercompany balances and transactions within the company have been eliminated. the company was charged by spectra-physics ab for direct costs and expenses associated with its operations which were included in cost of goods sold or selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate. spectra-physics ab's administrative costs which are indirectly attributable to the company, have not been historically charged to the company. however, these costs have been allocated to the company in the accompanying financial statements based on the estimated level of effort expended on behalf of the company. management believes that such method of allocation is reasonable and reflects a reasonable estimate of the level of expenses that would have been incurred had the company operated on a stand-alone basis. as shown on the combined statements of operations, "corporate overhead allocation" consisted of $281, $285 and $327 of such indirect costs for 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. continued 7 86 the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements, continued (amounts in thousands) 1. organization and basis of presentation, continued: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. estimates and industry factors: estimates- the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. technology - the market for the company's products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. the company believes that its future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its current products, to develop new products and systems on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to respond to changing customer needs and technological developments. to date, the company's revenues have been concentrated in the sale of fixed and handheld scanners. the company expects that increasing portions of its operations will be devoted to, and revenues will result from, the manufacture and sale of automated data collection systems and product-related services. patents- the company's success is dependent in part on its ability to continue to have patent protection for its products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. major customers - the company sells to various customers. a major customer represented 10% or more of net sales. one customer represents 24%, 12% and 14% of net sales in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. 8 87 the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements, continued (amounts in thousands) 2. summary of significant accounting policies: revenue recognition: revenue for sales of the company's products is recognized upon shipment. in conjunction with these sales, field service maintenance agreements are entered into for certain products. maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which is typically one to three years. cash and cash equivalents: the company participates in spectra-physics ab's centralized cash management system that invests excess cash in marketable securities, with maturities of three months or less. the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these investments. accounts receivable: accounts receivable are stated at face value, less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. property,plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements 10 to 45 years machinery and equipment 3 to 8 years leasehold improvements (limited to terms of the leases) 5 to 10 years intangible assets: in 1995, the company elected adoption of the accounting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of". this standard requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. no adjustments were necessary to implement this standard. intangibles resulting from business acquisitions represent goodwill, covenants not to compete and purchased technologies, and are being amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. when factors indicate that these intangibles should be evaluated for possible impairment, the company uses an estimate of the acquired business' undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangibles and its eventual disposition in measuring whether the intangibles are recoverable. other intangibles, which consist of patents, licenses and trademarks, including costs incurred in connection with the protection of patents, are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 10 years, using the straight-line method. continued 9 88 the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements, continued (amounts in thousands) 2. summary of significant accounting policies, continued. investment in minority-owned company: the company owns 11% of the equity of catalina electronic clearing systems, inc. (cecs) and accounts for it on the cost method. cecs has been a development stage company incurring recurring losses. when factors indicate that the company's investment in cecs should be evaluated for possible impairment, the company uses an estimate of cecs's expected undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition in measuring whether the investment in cecs is recoverable. in each year through 1995, the company has written down its investment to zero as the company believes its value has been impaired. software development costs: the company capitalizes costs incurred for internally developed product software where economic and technological feasibility has been established and for qualifying purchased product software. generally, software development costs incurred subsequent to achieving economic and technological feasibility using a working model have not been material. accordingly, no software development costs were capitalized. research and development expenses: the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. income taxes: the company uses the liability method to record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. the company has historically been included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of spectra-physics, inc. the income tax benefit reflected in the accompanying combined financial statements represents the company's share of spectra-physics, inc.'s income tax provision which is intended to approximate the benefit which would have been recognized had the company filed separate income tax returns. domestic income taxes have been treated as if settled immediately through an adjustment to spectra-physics ab's investment in the company. the current deferred income tax asset and the deferred income tax liability have been determined on a stand-alone basis. provision is made for u.s. income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign entities, unless such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. forward foreign exchange contracts: the company may occasionally enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against currency fluctuations relating to net foreign transactions and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. gains and losses on forward contracts are deferred and offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying hedged items. continued 10 89 the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements, continued (amounts in thousands) 2. summary of significant accounting policies, continued: foreign currency translation: the company's foreign subsidiaries' accounts are measured using local currency as the functional currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at year end. revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period are included in the cumulative adjustment account in spectra-physics ab's investment, net of related deferred income taxes. product warranty: the company's products typically have a warranty period of 12 months. estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale of the warranted products. the company maintains an accrual for warranty claims and adjusts this accrual periodically based on historical experience and known warranty claims. spectra-physics ab's investment: spectra-physics ab's investment reflects the historical activity between the company and spectra- physics ab and the company's cumulative results of operations. transactions with spectra-physics ab are reflected as though they were settled immediately as an addition to or reduction of spectra-physics ab's investment, and there are no significant amounts due to or from spectra-physics ab at the end of any period, except as described in notes 3 and 8. accounting standards pronouncements: in october 1995, the financial accounting standards board adopted statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 123, "accounting for stock-based compensation", which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 1995. the standard requires the company either to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for compensation cost related to stock options in the income statement or to continue using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion 25, "accounting for stock issued to employees". if the company opts not to use the fair value based method of accounting, pro forma disclosures will need to be reported in the notes to the financial statements. the company currently does not plan to adopt the fair value based method provisions of sfas no. 123. 11 90 the data capture group of spectra-physics ab notes to combined financial statements, continued (amounts in thousands) 3. acquisition of txcom: effective july 1, 1995, the company entered into an agreement to purchase all of the outstanding shares of txcom over a four-year period and purchased 60% of the outstanding shares as of that date. txcom manufactures and sells wireless radio frequency systems for material movement and inventory control applications. the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method. accordingly, the purchase price, net of cash acquired of $2,367, was allocated to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair values. the results of operations of txcom are included in the 1995 combined statement of operations since the date of acquisition. the total cost in excess of net assets acquired was allocated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of certain assets to purchased technology of $1,273, in-process technology of $963 and goodwill of $760. purchased technology and goodwill are being amortized over the estimated useful life of five years. in the third quarter of 1995, the company incurred a one-time noncash charge to operations of $863 for the write-off of in-process technology, because the technological feasibility of the in-process technology acquired had not been established and there was no alternative future use. an additional 12% of the shares of txcom were acquired on february 9, 1996 for approximately $1.8 million. the remaining 28% of the shares will be acquired in increments of 10%, 10% and 8% in january 1997, 1999 and 1999, respectively, at purchase prices based, in general, on txcom's operating earnings during certain measuring periods. the following unaudited pro forma summary presents information as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each fiscal year. the pro forma information is provided for information purposes only. it is based on historical information and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies. year ended december

there was no alternative future use. accumulated amortization related to the 1990 acquisition was approximately $102,270 and $120,318 at december 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. as of september 1995, the total purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was fully amortized. the deferred tax liability of $11,465 arose as a result of the difference between the bases of the purchased technology for financial reporting and tax purposes at the date of acquisition. 7. accounts payable and accrued liabilities: 1994 1995 accounts payable $ 6,822 $ 6,697 accrued payroll and related

royalty agreements to obtain licenses of certain patents. royalty expense under these agreements was $701, $1,107, and $855 in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. in 1994, the company entered into an agreement settling patent litigation brought by another manufacturer, which gives the company future rights to use certain manufacturing technology. the minimum royalty liability was $500, which was paid and included in other expense in 1994. under the agreement, the company will pay royalties not to exceed an additional $1 million. royalties due are first credited against the $500 payment. in 1995, the company applied approximately $80 in royalty costs against the prepayment. patent litigation: the company is currently a defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit filed against it by psc, inc. (psc) alleging that the company is infringing a psc patent for an optical scanning device for detecting bar codes. the company maintains that psc's patent is invalid, that the company has not infringed the patent, or both. in addition, the company is currently involved in other matters of litigation arising from the normal course of business. management is of the opinion that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company's combined financial position or results of operations. 12. benefit plans: savings plus plan: the company sponsors a savings plus plan (the 401(k) plan) for all u.s. employees meeting certain service requirements. the company may make contributions to the 401(k) plan each year that match in whole or in part the pre-tax contributions that employees make to the 401(k) plan. the company's contributions for 1993, 1994 and 1995 were $336, $300 and $328, respectively. incentive compensation: the company has two incentive plans. the first plan allows for payment of cash awards to management and key employees based upon achievement of annual financial performance goals or other by the company. the company recognized expenses relating to this plan of $49, $112 and $611 in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. the second plan allows for payments of cash awards to substantially all employees based upon improvement in the company's earnings over a three-year period. the company recognized expenses related to this plan of approximately $-0-, $178 and $489 in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. 18 97 the data capture

contracts: the company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. periodically, the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. the effect of this practice is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company's operating results. as of december 31, 1995, the company had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed 12 months and require the company to exchange foreign currencies for u.s. dollars at maturity, at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts. the company controls the credit risks associated with foreign currency transactions through approvals and centralized monitoring procedures but does not normally require collateral or other security from the parties to the financial instruments. fair value of financial instruments: in december 1991, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 107 ("sfas 107") "disclosures about fair value of financial instruments". sfas 107 requires disclosures of the estimated fair value of all financial instruments other than specified items such as lease contracts, subsidiary and affiliate investments and employers' pension and benefit obligations. the following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value. the resulting estimates of fair value require subjective judgments and are approximate. changes in the following methodologies and assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. o cash and cash equivalents: the carrying amounts reflected in the combined financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value. o note receivable: the fair value of note receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which a similar note receivable would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same maturities. o long-term debt and current portion of long-term debt: the estimated fair values of these financial instruments set forth below were determined by estimating future cash flows on a borrowing-by-borrowing basis and discounting these future cash flows using the company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 1995 -------------------- carrying estimated amount fair value cash and

("symbol") for violation of the antitrust laws, unfair trade practices and for declaration of noninfringement and/or invalidity of about 32 symbol patents. on or about the same effective date, symbol sued psc for patent infringement in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in manhattan, alleging infringement of about 19 patents, as well as suing psc's customer, data general. symbol has also alleged breaches of the symbol-psc license agreements of 1991 and 1995 and violation of a 1991 consent judgment. symbol has also moved for a preliminary injunction in that proceeding on four patents. presently before the southern district court is a motion by psc to transfer the southern district action to rochester. there is no date set for a pre-motion conference as required under the court's rules, as to symbol's request to perfect filing of its preliminary injunction motion.

spectra-physics scanning systems, inc., t.x.c.o.m., s.a. and certain related assets and liabilities to psc inc. gentlemen: we have acted as counsel to spectra-physics, inc., a delaware corporation ("seller"), in connection with the asset and stock purchase agreement (the "agreement"), dated may [ ], 1996, by and among you, seller and spectra-physics holdings, s.a., a french corporation. this opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to section 6.1(c) of the agreement. capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the agreement. we have participated in the negotiation and preparation of the agreement and have examined (i) corporate proceedings relating to seller's authorization, execution and delivery of the agreement and the other documents to be executed by seller in connection therewith and (ii) such governmental and corporate certificates and records, matters of law and other documents as we have deemed appropriate to enable us to render this opinion. in making such examination and rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. as to questions of fact material to our opinions, we have relied upon representations of the seller in the agreement and on certificates of officers of the seller and of public officials. 206 based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth above and below, we are of the opinion that: 1. each of seller and scanning is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. 2. the authorized capital stock of scanning consists of 100 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, all of which are issued and presently outstanding and none of which are held in its treasury. all such outstanding shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. to our knowledge, based upon our review of scanning's minutes of meetings of the company's board of directors and stockholders, there are no options, warrants, convertible instruments, or other rights, agreements or commitments obligating scanning to issue or sell shares of its capital stock. based upon our review of scanning's stock records, seller is the record owner of the shares. 3. seller has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform the agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. the agreement has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate, and, if necessary, shareholder, action on the part of seller. the agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by seller and, assuming due execution and delivery by buyer, constitutes the valid and binding obligations of seller, enforceable against seller in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). 4. except for a filing under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvement act of 1976, as amended, no consent, approval or authorization of, or registration or filing with any federal or state governmental authority or other regulatory agency of the united states, is required for the valid execution and delivery by the seller of the agreement or the consummation by seller of the transactions contemplated thereby. the opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the united states of america, the state of new york and the general corporation law of the state of delaware, and we express no opinion concerning the laws of any other jurisdiction. 207 our opinions expressed herein are solely for your benefit and, without our express written consent, neither our opinion nor this opinion letter may be assigned, quoted, circulated or be furnished to or relied upon by any other person. very truly yours, 208 exhibit h non-compete agreement agreement made this

liabilities to psc inc. gentlemen: we have acted as counsel to psc inc., a new york corporation ("buyer"), in connection with the asset and stock purchase agreement (the "agreement"), dated may [ ], 1996, by and among each of you and buyer. this opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to section 6.2(c) of the agreement. capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the agreement. we have participated in the negotiation and preparation of the agreement and have examined (i) corporate proceedings relating to buyer's authorization, execution and delivery of the agreement and the other documents to be executed by buyer in connection therewith and (ii) such governmental and corporate certificates and records, matters of law and other documents as we have deemed appropriate to enable us to render this opinion. in making such examination and rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. as to questions of fact material to our opinions, we have relied upon representations of the buyer in the agreement and on certificates of officers of the buyer and of public officials. 225 based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth above and below, we are of the opinion that: 1. buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of new york. 2. the authorized capital stock of buyer consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of which 9,969,185 shares of common stock are issued and presently outstanding, 38,500 shares of common stock are held in treasury and 4,016,149 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share, of which none are currently issued and outstanding. no shares of preferred stock are held in buyer's treasury. all such outstanding shares of common stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. options to purchase 2,440,203 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding. to our knowledge, based upon our review of buyer's minutes of meetings of the company's board of directors and stockholders, there are no other options, warrants, convertible instruments, or other rights, agreements or commitments obligating buyer to issue or sell shares of its capital stock except for warrants to purchase 975,000 shares of common stock of buyer [issued pursuant to the subordinated debt commitment letters referred to in section 3.1(q) of the agreement]. 3. buyer has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform the agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. the execution, delivery and performance of the agreement has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate, and, if necessary, shareholder, action on the part of buyer. the agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by buyer and, assuming due execution and delivery by seller, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of buyer, enforceable against buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). the note constitutes the valid and binding obligation of buyer, enforceable against buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). 4. the issuance by buyer of 977,135 shares of buyer's common stock, $.01 par value per share, to seller pursuant to the agreement has been validly authorized and such shares are validly 226 issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. such shares have been authorized for inclusion on the nasdaq national market upon official notice of issuance. 5. except for a filing under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvement act of 1976, as amended, no consent, approval or authorization of, or registration or filing with any federal or state governmental authority or other regulatory agency of the united states, is required for the valid execution and delivery by the buyer of the agreement or the consummation by buyer of the transactions contemplated thereby. the opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the united states of america and the state of new york, and we express no opinion concerning the laws of any other jurisdiction. our opinions expressed herein are solely for your benefit and, without our express written consent, neither our opinion nor this opinion letter may be assigned, quoted, circulated or be furnished to or relied upon by any other person. very truly yours, 227 exhibit k registration rights and holdback

"piggyback registration statement" means a registration statement of psc filed with the sec on a form for which psc then qualifies and which includes the registrable securities to be registered for sale thereunder pursuant to section 3 hereof, including post-effective amendments, in each case including the prospectus contained therein, all exhibits thereto and all material incorporated by reference therein.

(a) on or before 90 days after the date hereof, psc shall file with the sec a shelf registration statement relating to the offer and sale of the registrable securities by spi from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by spi and set forth in such shelf registration statement and, thereafter, shall use its best efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to be declared effective under the securities act as promptly as is practicable after the date of filing of such registration statement. (b) psc shall use its best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus forming a part thereof to be useable by spi for a period of three years from the date the shelf registration statement is declared effective or such shorter period that will terminate when all covered shares have been sold pursuant to a registration statement or otherwise cease to be registrable securities; provided that psc's obligation to keep the shelf registration statement effective shall cease three months after such time as spi owns less than 10% of the registrable securities it owns on the date hereof unless the reason spi's ownership of registrable securities fell below the 10% level was due to the "cut-back" provision contained in the last sentence of section 3(b) hereof. psc shall be deemed not to have used its best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective during the requisite period if psc voluntarily takes any action that would result in spi not being legally permitted to offer and sell any registrable securities during that period unless (i) such action is required by applicable law, (ii) upon the occurrence of any event that requires a supplement or amendment to the shelf registration statement as described in section 5(f) and such action is taken by psc in good faith and for valid business - 3 - 230 reasons or (iii) the continued effectiveness of the shelf registration statement would require psc to disclose a material financing, acquisition or other corporate transaction and the board of directors of psc shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is not in the best interests of psc and its stockholders, and, in the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, psc thereafter promptly complies with the requirement of paragraph 5(f) below. 3. piggy-back registration. (a) subject to the provisions of this section 3, if psc at any time proposes to register any of its equity securities (as defined in the exchange act) under the securities act, whether or not for sale for its own account (other than pursuant to section 2 hereof), and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, psc each such time will give written notice of such proposed filing to spi as soon as practicable (but in no event less than twenty days before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer spi the opportunity to include such number of registrable securities in the registration as spi may request (the "piggyback registration"); provided that spi notify psc of the amount of registrable securities to be registered not less than ten days before the anticipated filing date. (b) psc shall use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement for such offering on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of psc included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter of such registration advises psc in writing (with a copy to spi) that, in its opinion, inclusion of the number of registrable securities requested to be included in the registration would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by psc in such offering, then psc will include in such registration only the number of registrable securities recommended by the managing underwriter that may be included without adversely affecting the marketing of the securities to be sold by psc in such offering. 4. lock-up and holdback agreements. (a) spi lock-up.

(d) use its best efforts to register or qualify the covered shares under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as spi reasonably (in light of spi's intended plan of distribution) requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable spi to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of its covered shares; provided that psc will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(i) in the event an offering of registrable securities is pursuant to an underwritten offering, use its best efforts to obtain a comfort letter or comfort letters from psc's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by comfort letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests; (j) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and covering a period of twelve months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement; (k) use its best efforts to cause all covered shares to be listed on the nasdaq national market or listed on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is then listed; and (l) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all of the covered shares not later than the effective date of such registration statement. - 7 - 234 6. indemnification. (a) indemnification by psc. psc agrees to indemnify and hold harmless spi, its officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls spi within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the covered shares, in any amendment or supplement thereto, in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or any alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of, or are based upon, any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information furnished in writing to psc by spi or on spi's behalf expressly for use therein. (b) indemnification by spi. spi agrees to indemnify and hold harmless psc, its directors and officers and each party, if any, who controls psc within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from psc to spi, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by spi or on spi's behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the covered shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is brought or asserted against any party entitled to indemnification under clauses (a) or (b) above (an "indemnified party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought from any party who has agreed to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying party"), the indemnifying party will assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and will assume the payment of all expenses. such indemnified party will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party has been advised by counsel that there is a - 8 - 235 conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying party to represent such indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties). the indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party will indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. 7. contribution. if for any reason the indemnification provided for in the preceding sections 6(a) and 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party as contemplated by those sections, then the indemnifying party will contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, provided that spi will not be required to contribute in an amount greater than the difference between the net proceeds received by spi with respect to the sale of any registrable securities and all amounts already contributed by spi with respect to such claims. 8. participation in underwritten registrations. with regard to a piggyback registration, spi may not participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless spi (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the parties entitled to approve such arrangements;

(b) psc shall use its best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus forming a part thereof to be useable by spi for a period of three years from the date the shelf registration statement is declared effective or such shorter period that will terminate when all covered shares have been sold pursuant to a registration statement or otherwise cease to be registrable securities; provided that psc's obligation to keep the shelf registration statement effective shall cease three months after such time as spi owns less than 10% of the registrable securities -3- 5 it owns on the date hereof unless the reason spi's ownership of registrable securities fell below the 10% level was due to the "cut-back" provision contained in the last sentence of section 3(b) hereof. psc shall be deemed not to have used its best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective during the requisite period if psc voluntarily takes any action that would result in spi not being legally permitted to offer and sell any registrable securities during that period unless (i) such action is required by applicable law, (ii) upon the occurrence of any event that requires a supplement or amendment to the shelf registration statement as described in section 5(f) and such action is taken by psc in good faith and for valid business reasons or (iii) the continued effectiveness of the shelf registration statement would require psc to disclose a material financing, acquisition or other corporate transaction and the board of directors of psc shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is not in the best interests of psc and its stockholders, and, in the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, psc thereafter promptly complies with the requirement of paragraph 5(f) below. 3. piggy-back registration. ----------------------- (a) subject to the provisions of this section 3, if psc at any time proposes to register any of its equity securities (as defined in the exchange act) under the securities act, whether or not for sale for its own account (other than pursuant to section 2 hereof or other than pursuant to section 11.1 of the securities purchase agreements), and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, psc each such time will give written notice of such proposed filing to spi as soon as practicable (but in no event less than twenty days before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer spi the opportunity to include such number of registrable securities in the registration as spi may request (the "piggyback registration"); provided that spi notify psc of the amount of registrable securities to be registered not less than ten days before the anticipated filing date. (b) psc shall use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement for such offering on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of psc included therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter of such registration advises psc in writing (with a copy to spi) that, in its opinion, inclusion of the number of registrable securities requested to be included in the -4- 6 registration would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by psc in such offering, then psc will include in such registration only the number of registrable securities recommended by the managing underwriter that may be included without adversely affecting the marketing of the securities to be sold by psc in such offering provided that, if any securities are being offered for the account of any person other than psc and the holders of the registrable securities, the reduction in the number of registrable securities included in such registration shall not represent a greater percentage of the amount of registrable securities originally requested to be registered and sold in such registration than the lowest such percentage reduction imposed upon any other person. 4. lock-up and holdback agreements. ------------------------------- (a) spi lock-up. (i) during the lock-up period, without psc's prior written consent, spi agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of the registrable securities except pursuant to an available piggyback registration.

(c) furnish to spi, before filing the registration statement, if requested, copies of the registration statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter furnish to spi such number of copies of the registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto), the prospectus included in the registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other document as spi may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the covered shares owned by spi; (d) use its best efforts to register or qualify the covered shares under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the united states as spi reasonably (in -6- 8 light of spi's intended plan of distribution) requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable spi to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of its covered shares; provided that psc will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (e) use its best efforts to cause the covered shares to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of psc to enable spi to consummate the disposition of the covered shares; (f) notify spi of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to a registration statement or a prospectus contained therein so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such covered shares, a registration statement or such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and promptly make available to spi any such supplement or amendment; (g) enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form if the distribution of the covered shares is otherwise to be made in an underwritten offering) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such covered shares;

(i) in the event an offering of registrable securities is pursuant to an underwritten offering, use its best efforts to obtain a comfort letter or comfort letters from psc's independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of -7- 9 the type customarily covered by comfort letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests; (j) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and covering a period of twelve months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement; (k) use its best efforts to cause all covered shares to be listed on the nasdaq national market or listed on each national securities exchange on which the common stock is then listed; and (l) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all of the covered shares not later than the effective date of such registration statement. 6. indemnification. --------------- (a) indemnification by psc. psc agrees to indemnify and hold harmless spi, its officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls spi within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the covered shares, in any amendment or supplement thereto, in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or any alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of, or are based upon, any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information furnished in writing to psc by spi or on spi's behalf expressly for use therein. (b) indemnification by spi. spi agrees to indemnify and hold harmless psc, its directors and officers and each party, if any, who controls psc within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from psc to spi, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by spi or on spi's behalf expressly for use in any registration statement or -8- 10 prospectus relating to the covered shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is brought or asserted against any party entitled to indemnification under clauses (a) or (b) above (an "indemnified party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought from any party who has agreed to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying party"), the indemnifying party will assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and will assume the payment of all expenses. such indemnified party will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party has been advised by counsel that there is a conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying party to represent such indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties). the indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party will indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. 7. contribution. ------------ if for any reason the indemnification provided for in the preceding sections 6(a) and 6(b) is unavailable to an -9- 11 indemnified party as contemplated by those sections, then the indemnifying party will contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, provided that spi will not be required to contribute in an amount greater than the difference between the net proceeds received by spi with respect to the sale of any registrable securities and all amounts already contributed by spi with respect to such claims. 8. participation in underwritten registrations. ------------------------------------------- with regard to a piggyback registration, spi may not participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless spi (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the parties entitled to approve such arrangements;
