(b). requested registration. if, at any time prior to the third anniversary date of this agreement, michael shall receive a written request from one or more shareholders that michael effect the registration under the securities act of all or a part of such shareholders' registrable securities, then michael will, within ten (10) days after receipt thereof, give notice to all other shareholders of the receipt of such request and each such holder may elect by written notice received by michael within ten (10) days from the date of the notice by michael to have all or part of his registrable securities included in such registration. upon receipt of such notice, michael will, as soon as practicable, use reasonable efforts to effect the registration on form s-3 and pursuant to rule 415 (the "resale registration statement") under the securities act of all registrable securities which it has been so requested to register covering resales from time to time of such registrable securities and michael shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the resale registration statement to be declared effective by the sec as soon as practicable thereafter; and (ii) maintain the effectiveness of the resale registration statement -15- 16 continuously until the earliest of: (a) the date on which the shareholders no longer hold registrable securities registered under the resale registration statement or (b) the third anniversary of this agreement or such lesser time as may be permitted under rule 144 under the securities act to enable the shareholders to sell the registrable securities under the securities act without such registration. michael: (i) shall not be obligated to cause any special audit to be undertaken in connection with any such registration; (ii) shall be entitled to postpone for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of ninety (90) days, the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared pursuant to this section if michael is, at such time, conducting or about to conduct an underwritten public offering of equity securities (or securities convertible into equity securities) and is advised in writing by its managing underwriter that such underwritten public offer would, in its opinion, be adversely effected by the registration so requested; and (iii) shall be entitled to postpone such requested registration for up to 90 days if michael determines, in view of the advisability of deferring public disclosure of material corporate developments or other information, that such registration and the disclosure required to be made pursuant thereto would not be in the best interest of michael at such time. (c) effective registration. a registration pursuant to this section 9 will not be deemed to have been effected unless the registration statement has been declared effective by the sec; provided, however, that if after such registration statement has been declared effective, the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the sec or any other governmental authority or court, such registration statement will be deemed not to have -16- 17 been effected during the period of such interference until the offering of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement may legally resume. (d) registration expenses. michael shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the registration of the registrable securities pursuant to this section 9. such expenses shall include, without limitation, all printing, legal and accounting expenses incurred by michael and all registration and filing fees imposed by the sec, any state securities commission or the nasdaq-nms. each shareholder shall be responsible for any brokerage fees or commissions and any taxes of any kind (including, without limitation, transfer taxes) with respect to any disposition, sale or transfer of registrable securities and for any legal, accounting and other expenses incurred by such shareholder. (e) selection of underwriter and investment manager. if a requested registration pursuant to this section 9 involves an underwritten offering, michael shall have the exclusive right to select an investment banker or bankers and managers to administer the offering. (f) registration procedures. if and whenever michael is required to use its reasonable efforts to cause the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act as provided in this agreement, michael will, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (i) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such resale registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith and shall timely file with the sec all required filings under the exchange act as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all registrable securities covered by such resale registration statement and to keep the resale registration statement effective, but only while it shall be required under the provisions of this agreement to cause the registration statement -17- 18 to remain current; (ii) furnish to each shareholder seeking registration hereunder such number of copies of the prospectus included in such resale registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and summary prospectus), and such other documents as each such shareholder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities by such shareholder but only while it shall be required under the provisions hereof to cause the registration statement to remain current; (iii) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities covered by such resale registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the shareholders shall reasonably request, except that michael shall not, for any purpose, be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where, but for the requirements of this clause, it would not be obligated to be so qualified, to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (iv) use its reasonable efforts to list the registrable securities on the nasdaq-nms, if such registrable securities are not already so listed. (g) post-registration notices. michael shall promptly notify the shareholders: (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment (including any required filings under the exchange act) has been filed and, with respect to the resale registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any request by the sec or any state securities authority for amendments or supplements to the resale registration statement and prospectus or for additional information after the resale registration statement has become effective; (iii) of the issuance by the sec of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the resale registration statement; (iv) of the issuance by any -18- 19 state securities commission or other regulatory authority of any order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the registrable securities under such state's securities or "blue sky" laws; and (v) of the happening of any event which makes any statement made in the resale registration statement or related prospectus untrue or which requires the making of changes in such resale registration statement or prospectus so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. as soon as practicable, following the expiration of the suspension period (as defined below), michael shall prepare and file with the sec and furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. upon receipt of any notice (a "suspension notice") by the shareholders from michael of the happening of any event of the kind described in this section 9(g), the shareholders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the registrable securities pursuant to the resale registration statement until the shareholders' receipt of the copies of the supplemental or amended prospectus contemplated by this section 9(g) or until the shareholders have been advised in writing (the "advice") by michael that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by michael, will, or will request any broker or dealer acting as the shareholders' agent(s) to deliver to michael (at michael's expense) all copies, other -19- 20 than permanent file copies then in the shareholders' or their brokers' or dealers' possession of the prospectus covering such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice; provided, however, that in no event shall the period from the date on which the shareholders receive a suspension notice to the date which the shareholders receive either the advice or copies of the supplemental or amended prospectus contemplated in this section 9(g) (the "suspension period") exceed 60 calendar days. (h) information. michael may require each selling shareholder to furnish it with such information regarding such selling shareholder and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of such securities as michael may from time to time reasonably request in writing. (i) underwriting agreement. the selling shareholders shall execute and deliver an underwriting agreement in customary form in connection with any underwritten offering made pursuant to a registration hereunder. section 9 indemnification and contribution (a) indemnification by michael. michael agrees to indemnify and hold harmless to the full extent permitted by law, each shareholder from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by shareholders (collectively, the "damages") to which the shareholders may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such damages (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the resale registration statement (or any supplement or amendment thereto, including filings under the exchange act) pursuant to which registrable securities were -20- 21 registered under the securities act, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (as amended or supplemented if michael shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such damages arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the shareholders furnished in writing to michael by the shareholders specifically for use therein; provided, however, that michael shall not be liable to the shareholders under this section 10(a) to the extent that any such damages were caused by the fact that the shareholders sold registrable securities to a person as to who it shall be established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the prospectus as then amended or supplemented if, but only if: (i) michael has previously furnished copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus to the shareholders; and (ii) such damages were caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission contained in the prospectus so delivered which was corrected in such amended or supplemented prospectus. (b) indemnification by shareholders. the shareholders agree to indemnify, jointly and severally, and hold harmless michael, its stockholders, directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls michael within the meaning of either section 15 of the securities act or section 20 of the exchange act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from michael to -21- 22 the shareholders in section 10(a) of this agreement but only with reference to information relating to the shareholders furnished in writing to michael by the shareholders specifically for use in the resale registration statement (or any amendment thereto) or any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, however, that the shareholders shall not be obligated to provide such indemnity to the extent that such damages result from a failure of michael to promptly amend or take action to correct or supplement any such resale registration statement or prospectus on the basis of corrected or supplemental information provided in writing by the shareholders to michael expressly for such purpose. in no event shall the liability of the shareholders hereunder be greater in amount than the amount of the proceeds received by the shareholders upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) contribution. to the extent that the indemnification provided for in section 10(a) or (b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any damages, then each indemnifying party under such section, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such damages in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of michael, on the one hand, and the shareholders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such damages, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of michael, on the one hand, and the shareholders, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by michael or by the shareholders and the parties' relative intent, -22- 23 knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. if indemnification is available under section 10(a) or (b), the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in such sections without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or the indemnified party or any other equitable considerations provided for in this section 10(c). michael and the shareholders agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 10(c) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in this section. section 10. general provisions (a) governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions. (b) remedies. michael, on the one hand, and the shareholders and sellers, on the other, acknowledge and agree that the other would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages in the event that any of the covenants or agreements in this agreement of such party were not performed in accordance with its terms, and it is therefore agreed that in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right such party may have, any party will have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief (including specific performance) in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof. all rights, powers and remedies provided under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative. -23- 24 (c) notices. all notices, demands and other communications which may or are required to be given hereunder or with respect hereto shall be given by the representative on behalf of the shareholders and sellers and by michael on behalf of itself. all such notices, demands and other communications shall be in writing, shall be given either by personal delivery or by nationally recognized overnight courier or by telecopier, and shall be deemed to have been given or made when personally delivered, one business day after delivered to a nationally recognized overnight courier, postage prepaid, and receipt requested, or one business day after transmission by facsimile, receipt confirmed, addressed as follows: (i) if to michael: jeffrey m. shapiro executive vice president michael foods, inc. 5353 wayzata boulevard 324 park national bank building minneapolis, minnesota 55416 telephone: 612-546-1500 facsimile no.: 612-546-3711 with a copy to: albert a. woodward maun & simon, plc 2000 midwest plaza building west 801 nicollet mall minneapolis, minnesota 55402 telephone: 612-338-1113 facsimile no.: 612-338-2271 -24- 25 (ii) if to the shareholders or sellers: arthur n. papetti c/o papetti's hygrade egg products, inc. 100 trumbull street elizabeth, new jersey 07206 telephone: 908-351-0477 facsimile no.: 908-354-0136 as representative with a copy to: martin b. o'connor, ii robert m. larose o'connor, morss & o'connor thompson coburn liberty hall center one mercantile center 1085 morris avenue suite 3400 union, new jersey 07083 st. louis, missouri 63101 telephone: 908-354-5660 telephone: 314-552-6000 facsimile no.: 908-354-5786 facsimile no.: 314-552-7000 or to such other address as any such person or entity may from time to time designate by notice to the others.
