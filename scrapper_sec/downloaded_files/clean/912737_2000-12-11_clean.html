reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i the merger; effect of merger section 1.1 the merger. upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law, as amended, and any rules and regulations thereunder (the "delaware corporation law"), sub shall be

virtue of the merger be changed to such name as parent, in its sole discretion, may choose. section 1.2 effective time of the merger. the merger shall become effective at such time as a properly executed certificate of merger or other appropriate document is duly filed with the secretary of state of delaware, which filing shall be made as soon as practicable following fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in articles vii, viii and ix hereof or such later time as is specified in such filing (the "effective time"). section 1.3 effects of merger. the merger shall have the effects set forth in section 259 of the delaware corporation law. a-1 6 article ii the surviving corporation section 2.1 certificate of incorporation. the certificate of incorporation of the company as in

amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by the delaware corporation law. section 2.3 officers and directors. the officers of the company immediately prior to the effective time shall be the officers of the surviving corporation after the effective time and the directors of sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the directors of the surviving corporation after the

(a) at the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of any company stockholder: (1) conversion of company common stock. each share of company common stock outstanding after giving effect to the company recapitalization shall be converted into 0.180 fully paid and nonassessable shares of parent common stock (the "exchange ratio"). (2) each share of company class b stock outstanding upon consummation of the company recapitalization shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of company common stock. (3) cancellation of company treasury stock. all shares of company common stock which are held in the treasury of the company upon consummation of the company recapitalization shall be canceled and shall cease to exist. (b) if at any time prior to the effective time, the outstanding shares of parent common stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, the exchange ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted. the issuance of shares of parent common stock pursuant to parent's dividend reinvestment plan consistent with past practices shall not constitute a stock dividend for this purpose. (c) each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of sub shall be converted into that number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of company common stock as shall result in (i) the sum of the aggregate number of shares of company common stock issued to parent upon such conversion plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares of company common stock issued to futuronics pursuant to section 3.1(a)(2) being equal to 94.9 percent of the total number of shares of company common stock issued pursuant to section 3.1(a)(2) and this section 3.1(c). a-2 7 (d) all company common stock outstanding immediately after the company recapitalization and immediately prior to the effective time (the "canceled company stock") shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing such canceled company stock shall (subject to section 3.3) thereafter represent for all corporate purposes the shares of parent common stock into which such shares of canceled company stock have been converted pursuant to the merger. certificates previously representing such shares of canceled company stock shall be exchanged for a confirmation of ownership of parent common stock issued in consideration therefor upon surrender in accordance with section 3.2, without interest. (e) the parent shall issue shares of parent common stock to be issued in the merger in uncertificated form, and in accordance with section 3.2 shall send to each person entitled to receive such shares the information required under section 2-210(c) of the maryland general corporation law with respect to such shares (a "confirmation"). section 3.2 surrender. (a) prior to the closing, parent shall select a person or persons to act as exchange agent for the merger (the "exchange agent"), which person or persons shall be reasonably acceptable to the company, for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing canceled company stock for confirmations as to the share consideration. on the closing date, the surviving corporation shall deliver to the exchange agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of canceled company stock immediately prior to the effective time (the "converting stockholders"), the share consideration and related information. as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time but in no event more than five business days after the effective time, the surviving corporation shall cause the exchange agent to send a notice and a letter of transmittal to each converting stockholder advising such holder of the effectiveness of the merger and the procedure for surrendering to the exchange agent for cancellation such holder's certificates representing canceled company stock ("certificates"), in exchange for the share consideration. each converting stockholder will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the exchange agent for cancellation of one or more certificates, a confirmation representing the number of shares of parent common stock into which such shares are converted in the merger. parent common stock into which canceled company stock shall be converted in the merger shall be deemed to have been issued at the effective time (the "share consideration"). in the event that any converting stockholder's certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, such converting stockholder will be entitled to receive the share consideration only after providing an affidavit of loss and indemnity bond, in form satisfactory to the exchange agent. (b) converting stockholders shall be entitled, at and after the effective time, to vote the number of shares of parent common stock into which their shares of canceled company stock shall have been converted so long as they remain record holders of such shares of parent common stock, regardless of whether the certificates formerly representing the canceled company stock shall have been surrendered in accordance with this section 3.2 or a confirmation with respect to such shares of parent common stock shall have been issued. (c) any converting stockholder who has not exchanged his certificates for parent common stock in accordance with subsection (a) within six months after the effective time shall have no further claim upon the exchange agent, and shall thereafter look only to parent and the surviving corporation for payment in respect of his shares of canceled company stock. until so surrendered, certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the share consideration. if any certificates entitled to payment pursuant to section 3.1 shall not have been surrendered for such payment prior to such date on which any a-3 8 payment in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, the shares of canceled company stock represented thereby shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to be canceled and no money or other property will be due to the holder thereof. section 3.3 dividends; transfer taxes. no dividends that are declared or made with respect to parent common stock will be paid to persons entitled to receive confirmations representing parent common stock pursuant to this agreement until such persons surrender their
