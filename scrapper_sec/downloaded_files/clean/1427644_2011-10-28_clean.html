(b) cash or common stock. subject to the terms hereof, the company shall have the right to satisfy payment of the interest amount in full on each payment date either in cash or in shares of common stock (but not both) at the company's option. the company shall deliver to the holders a written irrevocable notice in the form of exhibit b attached hereto electing to pay such interest amount in full on such payment date in either cash or common stock ("payment election notice"). such payment election notice shall be delivered at least ten (10) trading days prior to the applicable payment date (the date of such notice being hereinafter referred to as the "notice date"). if such payment election notice is not delivered within the prescribed period set forth in the preceding sentence, then the payment shall be made in either cash or shares of common stock on the same terms hereunder at the holder's sole option. if the company elects or is required to pay any interest amount in cash on a payment date, then on such payment date the company shall pay to the holder an amount equal to such interest amount in satisfaction of such obligation. if the company elects or is required to pay any interest amount in shares of common stock, the number of such shares to be issued for such payment date shall be the number determined by dividing (x) the interest amount, by (y) the conversion price as of such payment date. such shares shall be issued and delivered within three (3) trading days following such payment date and shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully 4 paid, non-assessable and free and clear of all encumbrances, restrictions and legends. if the holder does not receive the requisite number of shares of common stock in the form required above within such three trading day period, the holder shall have the option of either (a) requiring the company to issue and deliver all or a portion of such shares or (b) canceling such election (whether by the company or holder) to pay such interest amount in common stock (in whole or in part), in which case the company shall immediately pay in cash the full such interest amount due hereunder or such portion as the holder specifies is to be paid in cash instead of common stock. except as otherwise provided in this section 1, all holders of notes must be treated the same with respect to such payment of the interest amount in shares of common stock. (c) no equity conditions. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the company shall be prohibited from exercising its right to pay the interest amount in shares of common stock (and must deliver cash in respect thereof) on the applicable payment date if at any time from the notice date until the time at which the holders receive such shares any of the equity conditions fail to be satisfied, unless otherwise waived in writing by the holder in whole or in part at the holder's option. (d) ownership/issuance limitations. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the company shall be prohibited from exercising its right to pay the interest amount in shares of common stock (and must deliver cash in respect thereof) on the applicable payment date to the extent, and only to the extent, that such payment in shares of common stock would result in the holder hereof exceeding the limitations contained in section 3(i) below. in such event, then (i) the company on the payment date shall pay such portion of the interest amount in shares of common stock as may be effected without exceeding such limitations, and (ii) the company shall pay the balance of such interest amount in cash. section 2. conversion. (a) conversion right. subject to the terms hereof and restrictions and limitations contained herein, the holder shall have the right, at such holder's option, at any time and from time to time to convert the outstanding current principal amount under this restated note in whole or in part by delivering to the company a fully executed notice of conversion in the form of conversion notice attached hereto as exhibit a (the "conversion notice"), which may be transmitted by facsimile or email. notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this note and the outstanding principal amount hereunder shall not be convertible into common stock to the extent that such conversion would result in the holder hereof exceeding the limitations contained in, or otherwise violating the provisions of, section 2(i) below. (b) common stock issuance upon conversion. (i) conversion date procedures. upon conversion of this note pursuant to section 2(a) above, the outstanding current principal amount of the restated note elected to be converted hereunder shall be converted into such number of fully paid, validly issued and non-assessable shares of common stock, free of any liens, claims and encumbrances and without any restrictions or legends, as is determined by dividing the amount of the current outstanding principal amount of this restated note being converted by the then applicable conversion price: 5 for example, a $100,000 conversion amount with a conversion price of $0.16 would be entitled to 625,000 conversion shares ($100,000/$0.16). obligor shall pay holder liquidated damages in the event and to the extent that holder receives net sales proceeds equal to less than the principal and accrued interest due to holder hereunder upon sale by holder of all common shares received by holder upon conversion of this amended and restated debenture number mammoth note number 001. in the event that holder does not realize net proceeds from the sale of common shares equal to $143,000 (sales net of all expenses), then as liquidated damages, holder shall be entitled to the continue to submit conversion notices, until the net proceeds realized yields $143,000. thus, for example and avoidance of doubt, in the event that holder receives sales proceeds of $140,000 upon sale of all common shares received by holder upon the full conversion hereof, then obligor shall pay holder liquidated damages of $3,000. the liquidated damages to be paid pursuant to the terms hereunder shall be convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with the of this restated note; provided, however, that holder shall provide obligor with reasonable evidence (in the form of brokerage statements or the like) to support the amount of liquidated damages that may be due. (ii) delivery. the company will deliver to the holder not later than three (3) trading days after the conversion date, shares (which certificate(s) shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions) representing the number of shares of common stock being acquired upon the conversion of this note via deposits and withdrawal at custodian (dwac). if in the case of any conversion hereunder, such shares are not delivered to the holder by the thrid trading day after the conversion date, the holder shall be entitled by written notice to the company at any time on or before its receipt of such shares, to rescind such conversion, in which event the company shall immediately return this note tendered for conversion. if the company fails to deliver to the holder such shares pursuant to this section 2 of this agreement (free of any restrictions on transfer or legends) in accordance herewith, prior to the fifth trading day after the conversion date, the company shall pay to the holder as liquidated damages, in cash, an amount equal to 2% of the principal amount per month until the free trading shares are delivered. (iii) surrender of note not required. the date of any conversion notice hereunder and any payment date shall be referred to herein as the "conversion date". if the holder is converting less than all of the outstanding principal amount hereunder pursuant to a conversion notice, the company shall promptly deliver to the holder (but no later than five trading days after the conversion date) a note for such outstanding principal amount as has not been converted if this note has been surrendered to the company for partial conversion. the holder shall not be required to physically surrender this note to the company upon any conversion hereunder unless the full outstanding principal amount represented by this note is being converted or repaid. the holder and the company shall maintain records showing the outstanding principal amount so converted and repaid and the dates of such conversions or repayments or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the holder and the company, so as not to require physical surrender of this note upon each such conversion or repayment. 6 (c) conversion price adjustments. (i) stock dividends, splits and combinations. if the company or any of its subsidiaries, at any time while the notes are outstanding (a) shall pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on any equity securities (including instruments or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such equity securities) in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide outstanding common stock into a larger number of shares, or (c) combine outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then each affected conversion price (as defined below) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding before such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding after such event. any adjustment made pursuant to this section 3(c)(i) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. as used herein, the affected conversion prices (each an "affected conversion price") shall refer to: (i) the conversion price, and (ii) each reported lowest closing bid price occurring on any trading day included in the period used for determining the conversion price, which trading day occurred before the record date in the case of events referred to in clause (a) of this subparagraph 3(c)(i) and before the effective date in the case of the events referred to in clauses (b) and (c) of this subparagraph 3(c)(i). (ii) distributions. if the company or any of its subsidiaries, at any time while the notes are outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets or cash or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security of the company or any of its subsidiaries (excluding those referred to in section 3(c)(i) above), then concurrently with such distributions to holders of common stock, the company shall distribute to holders of the notes the amount of such indebtedness, assets, cash or rights or warrants which the holders of notes would have received had all their notes been converted into common stock at the conversion price immediately prior to the record date for such distribution. (iii) rounding of adjustments. all calculations under this section 3 or section 1 shall be made to 4 decimal places for dollar amounts or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. (iv) notice of adjustments. whenever any affected conversion price is adjusted pursuant to section 3(c)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, the company shall promptly deliver to each holder of the notes, a notice setting forth the affected conversion price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, provided that any failure to so provide such notice shall not affect the automatic adjustment hereunder. (v) change in control transactions. in case of any change in control transaction, the holder shall have the right thereafter to, at its option, convert this note, in whole or in part, at the conversion price into the shares of stock and other securities, cash and/or property receivable upon or deemed to be held by holders of common stock following such change in control transaction, 7 and the holder shall be entitled upon such event to receive such amount of securities, cash or property as the shares of the common stock of the company into which this note could have been converted immediately prior to such change in control transaction would have been entitled if such conversion were permitted, subject to such further applicable adjustments set forth in this section 3. the terms of any such change in control transaction shall include such terms so as to continue to give to the holders the right to receive the amount of securities, cash and/or property upon any conversion or redemption following such change in control transaction to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon such conversion would have been entitled in such change in control transaction, and interest payable hereunder shall be in cash or such new securities and/or property, at the holder's option. this provision shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. (vi) notice of certain events. if: a. the company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its common stock; or b. the company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of its common stock; or c. the company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the common stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights; or d. the approval of any stockholders of the company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the common stock of the company, any consolidation or merger to which the company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company, of any compulsory share of exchange whereby the common stock is converted into other securities, cash or property; or e. the company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the company; then the company shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this note, and shall cause to be mailed to the holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the books of the company, on or prior to the date notice to the company's stockholders generally is given, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. 8 (d) reservation and issuance of underlying securities. the company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued common stock solely for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of this note (including repayments in stock), free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of persons other than the holders of the notes, not less than such number of shares of common stock as shall (subject to any additional requirements of the company as to reservation of such shares set forth in the exchange agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments under this section 3 but without regard to any ownership limitations contained herein) upon the conversion of this note hereunder in common stock (including repayments in stock). the company covenants that all shares of common stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and freely tradeable. (e) no fractions. upon a conversion hereunder the company shall not be required to issue stock certificates representing fractions of shares of common stock, but may if otherwise permitted, make a cash payment in respect of any final fraction of a share based on the closing price of a share of common stock at such time. if the company elects not, or is unable, to make such a cash payment, the holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the final fraction of a share, one whole share of common stock, rounded to the nearest whole share of common stock. (f) charges, taxes and expenses. issuance of certificates for shares of common stock upon the conversion of this note (including repayment in stock) shall be made without charge to the holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the holder; provided, however, that in the event certificates for shares of common stock are to be issued in a name other than the name of the holder, this note when surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by an assignment form; and provided further, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any such transfer.
