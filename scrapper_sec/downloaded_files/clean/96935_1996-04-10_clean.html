(c) if any certificate evidencing shares of newco common stock is to be delivered to a person other than the person in whose name the certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of such certificate evidencing shares of newco common stock that the certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be proper and that the person requesting such transfer pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the exchange agent that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(e) approval and adoption of this agreement by the shareholders of alc and the stockholders ti shall constitute, as an integral part of the combination, ratification of the appointment of, and the reappointment of, said exchange agent. 6 section 2.3 no further transfers. after the effective time, there shall be no registration of transfers of shares on the respective stock transfer books of alc

share of newco common stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of newco common stock that would otherwise be received by such holder) will be entitled hereunder to receive a cash payment. the amount of such cash payment shall equal, in the case of each fractional share, an amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, calculated as the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the high and low per share sales prices for the newco common stock on the new york stock exchange for each of the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective time as quoted in the wall street journal or other reliable financial newspaper or publication, or, if the newco common stock does not trade prior to the effective time on a "when issued" basis, the average of the high and low per share sales prices for the newco common stock on the trading day that includes the effective time (or, if the effective time does not occur on a trading day, on the first trading day thereafter). for the purposes of the preceding sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which trading generally takes place on the new york stock exchange. no such fractional share interest shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of newco. section 2.5 withholding. newco or the exchange agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or issuable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of alc common stock or ti common stock such amounts as newco or the exchange agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or issuance under the code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. to the extent that amounts are so withheld by newco or the exchange agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of alc common stock or ti common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by newco or the exchange agent. 7 article iii representations and warranties section 3.1 representations and warranties of alc and ti. when used in connection

(c) prior to the effective time, ti shall take such actions as may be necessary such that at the effective time each right to purchase shares of ti common stock pursuant to the ti espp ("ti rights"), whether or not then issuable or exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to shares of newco common stock. at the effective time, (i) each ti right assumed by newco shall relate solely to shares of newco common stock, (ii) the number of shares of newco common stock subject to each ti right shall be equal to the number of shares of newco common stock into which shares of ti common stock subject to such ti right would have been converted by virtue of the ti merger in accordance with article ii had such share of ti common stock been outstanding at the effective time, and (iii) the per share price for each share of newco common stock subject to an ti right shall be equal to (y) the price for the share of newco common stock that could otherwise be acquired pursuant to such ti right divided by (z) the ti exchange ratio, rounded up to the 31 nearest cent. at or prior to the effective time, ti shall make all necessary arrangements with respect to the ti espp to permit the assumption of the ti rights by newco pursuant to this section 4.11; provided, however, that such arrangements shall not include any change in the terms of the ti espp if such change would, in the opinion of ti's independent public accountants, have an adverse effect on newco's ability to account for the combination as a pooling of interests for financial accounting purposes. (d) prior to the effective time, ti shall take such actions as may be necessary such that at the effective time each option (an "ti option") to purchase a share of ti common stock outstanding pursuant to the ti stock plans, whether or not then exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights to purchase shares of newco common stock. at the effective time, (i) each ti option assumed by newco may be exercised solely for shares of newco common stock, (ii) the number of shares of newco common stock subject to each ti option shall be equal to the number of shares of newco common stock into which shares of ti common stock subject to such ti option would have been converted by virtue of the ti merger in accordance with article ii, had such share of ti common stock been outstanding at the effective time, and (iii) the per share exercise price for each such ti option shall be equal to (y) the exercise price for the share of ti common stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such ti option divided by (z) the ti exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. at or prior to the effective time, ti shall make all necessary arrangements with respect to the applicable ti stock plans to permit the assumption of the unexercised ti options by newco pursuant to this section 4.11; provided, however, that such arrangements shall not include any change in the terms of the applicable ti stock plans if such change would, in the opinion of ti's independent public accountants, have an adverse effect on ti's ability to account for the combination as a pooling of interests for financial accounting purposes. (e) effective at the effective time, newco shall assume each alc option, alc right, alc award, ti option and ti right (collectively, the "derivative securities") in accordance with the terms under which it was issued and any applicable agreement by which it is evidenced. at or prior to the effective time, newco shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of newco common stock for delivery upon exercise of derivative securities assumed by it in accordance with this section 4.11. as soon as practicable after the effective time, newco shall file a registration statement on form s-3 or form s-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of newco common stock subject to such derivative securities, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or 32 prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such derivative securities remain outstanding. (f) as soon as practicable after the effective time, newco shall deliver to each holder of derivative securities an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto and such derivative security shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including further anti-dilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this section 4.11 after giving effect to the combination). newco shall comply with the terms of all such derivative securities and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, any applicable alc stock plan or ti stock plan that derivative securities which qualified for special tax treatment prior to the effective time continue to so qualify after the effective time.

who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the delaware general corporation law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in section c of this article eight with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. b. right to advancement of expenses. the right to indemnification conferred in section a of this article eight shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the delaware general corporation law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section b or otherwise. the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in sections a and b of this article eight shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. -3- c. right of indemnitee to bring suit. if a claim under section a or b of this article eight is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. in (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the delaware general corporation law. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the delaware general corporation law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. in any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement or expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this article eight or otherwise shall be on the corporation. d. non-exclusivity of rights. the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this article eight shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the corporation's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. e. insurance. the corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the delaware general corporation law. f. indemnification of employees and agents of the corporation. the corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this -4- article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation. g. amendment.

modification. nine: the following provisions are inserted for the definition, limitation and regulation of actions of the stockholders of the corporation: a. action to be taken at stockholder meetings

(g) the bylaws of the corporation may contain additional provisions not inconsistent with this article nine, clause (c) regarding nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders. without limiting the category of such provisions which would not be inconsistent with this article nine, clause (c), a provision in the bylaws of the corporation which sets forth additional information which must be provided by a stockholder in the notice required by this article nine, clause (c) shall not be deemed to be so inconsistent. d. voting. the stockholders shall not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. ten: (a) except as otherwise fixed pursuant to the provisions of article four hereof relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time by or pursuant to the bylaws. the directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes: class i, class ii and class iii. each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the whole number of the board of directors. the terms of office of the initial classes of directors shall be as follows: the class i directors shall be elected to hold office for a term to expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal; the class ii directors shall be elected to hold office for a -7- term to expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal; and the class iii directors shall be elected to hold office for a term to expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal, and in the case of each class, until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. at each annual meeting of stockholders the directors elected to succeed those whose terms have expired shall be identified as being of the same class as the directors they succeed and shall be elected to hold office for a term to expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders after their election, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal, and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

voting together as a single class, or (y) a majority of the board of directors. eleven: in addition to any other considerations which the board of directors, any committee thereof or any individual director lawfully may take into account in determining whether to take or refrain from taking corporate action on any matter, including making or declining to make any recommendations to the stockholders of the corporation, the board of directors, any committee thereof or any individual director may in its, his or her discretion consider the long term as well as the short term best interests of the corporation (including the possibility that these interests may best be served by the continued independence of the corporation), taking into account and weighing as deemed appropriate the effects of such action on employees, suppliers, -8- distributors and customers of the corporation and its subsidiaries and the effect upon communities in which the offices or facilities of the corporation and its subsidiaries are located and any other factors considered pertinent. this article eleven shall be deemed to grant discretionary authority to the board of directors, any committee thereof and each individual director, and shall not be deemed to provide to any specific constituency any right to be considered. twelve: in addition to the requirements of (i) law, and (ii) the other provisions of this restated certificate of incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of the

other disposition to the corporation or to a direct or indirect subsidiary of the corporation of any common stock of the corporation held by a significant shareholder or any other assets of a significant shareholder which, if included with all other dispositions consummated during the same fiscal year of the corporation by the same significant shareholder, would result in dispositions of assets having an aggregate fair value in excess of five percent of the total consolidated assets of the corporation as shown on its certified balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year preceding the proposed disposition, (5) any reclassification of common stock of the corporation, or any recapitalization involving common stock of the corporation, consummated within five years after a

securities, (6) any dissolution and (7) any agreement, contract or other arrangement providing for any of the transactions described in this definition of fundamental change but, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, fundamental change shall not include any merger pursuant to the delaware general corporation law, as amended from time to time, which does not require a vote of the corporation's stockholders for approval. as used in this article twelve, "significant shareholder" shall mean any person who or which beneficially owns a number of shares of common stock of the corporation, whether or not such number includes shares not then outstanding or entitled to vote, which exceeds a number equal to fifteen percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the

single class, shall be required to alter, amend, supplement or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with the purpose or intent of, articles nine, ten, eleven, twelve or thirteen; provided,

corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the delaware general corporation law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in section 4 of this article viii with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. section 3. right to advancement of expenses. the right to indemnification conferred in section 2 of this article viii shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the delaware general corporation law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section 3 or otherwise. the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in sections 2 and 3 of this article viii shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. section 4. right of indemnitee to bring suit. if a claim under section 2 or 3 of this article viii is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover 12 the unpaid amount of the claim. if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. in (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the delaware general corporation law. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the delaware general corporation law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.
