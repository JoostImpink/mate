shareholder agreements, but is not an affirmation by fcb of the existence of a group for purposes of section 13(d)(3) or section 13(g)(3) of the securities exchange act of 1934 or rule 13d-5(b)(1) thereunder. pursuant to rule 13d-4 of the act, fcb disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares. as an inducement for fcb to enter into the merger agreement and in consideration thereof, each of the shareholders entered into the shareholder agreements with fcb. pursuant to the shareholder agreements, each of the shareholders has agreed, among other things, to vote or to cause to be voted all of the shares of such shareholder that are subject thereto (i) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any 4 covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the company under the merger agreement; and (iii) except with the prior written consent of fcb, against the following actions (other than the merger): (a) any extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the company; (b) any sale, lease, transfer or disposition of a material amount of the assets of the company; (c) any change in the majority of the board of directors of the company; (d) any material change in the present capitalization of the company; (e) any amendment of the company&#146;s articles of incorporation or bylaws; (f) any other change in the corporate structure, business, assets or ownership of the company; or (g) any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to

the termination date (as defined in the shareholder agreement) to vote or give instructions, whether before or after the termination date, in any manner inconsistent with clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence. under the shareholder agreements, each of the shareholders also has agreed not to (i) sell, transfer, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his or her shares without the prior written consent of fcb, other than shares sold or surrendered to pay the exercise price of any company options or to satisfy the company&#146;s withholding obligations with respect to any taxes resulting from such exercise, or (ii) pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber such shares. in addition, each shareholder has agreed not to (directly or indirectly) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) from any person. the shareholder agreements will terminate upon the consummation of the merger, except that if the merger is not consummated, the obligations of the shareholder thereunder will terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are summarized as follows: under the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, which has been approved by the board of directors of each of fcb and the company, at the effective time of the merger, fcb will acquire all of the outstanding common stock and options of the company for approximately $277 million in consideration (based on the closing price of fcb common stock on may 12, 2006, the last trading day prior to the execution of the definitive agreement) consisting of fcb common stock for the outstanding common stock of the company and cash for the company stock options. the transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction under section 368(a) of the internal revenue code, as amended. 5 the merger agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio of 0.735 of a share of fcb common stock for each company share, provided that the average closing price of fcb&#146;s common stock remains within a collar over a 15 trading day measurement period prior to the closing of the transaction. if such average price is outside the collar, and if the change in such price is disproportionate to an agreed upon banking index, the merger agreement may be terminated, in the case of a significant increase, by fcb unless the exchange ratio is adjusted by the company, and may be terminated, in the case of a significant decline, by the company unless the exchange ratio is adjusted by fcb. consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including among other things (i) approval of the merger by the company&#146;s shareholders and, if necessary, fcb&#146;s shareholders, (ii) approval of an amendment to fcb&#146;s bylaws to increase the size of the board of directors to accommodate the appointment to fcb&#146;s board of directors of gary deems, chairman of the company, and mark baker, a director of the company and (iii) approval of regulatory authorities. in addition, the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both the company and fcb and provides that, in the event the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as more fully described therein, the company will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $9.1 million. furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the directors of the surviving corporation (fcb) shall be the directors of fcb immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and two directors from the company, gary deems and mark baker, each to hold office until such time as their successors are duly elected and qualified. the officers of the surviving corporation shall be the officers of fcb. michael perdue, president and chief executive officer of the company, will become president and chief executive officer of first national bank,
