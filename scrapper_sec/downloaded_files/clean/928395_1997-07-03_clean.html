("jp") expressly disclaims any beneficial ownership of such shares of rykoff common stock which are ob- tainable by jp upon exercise of the option because the option is exercisable only in the circumstances set forth in item 4, none of which has occurred as of the date hereof. (2) gives effect to the issuance of rykoff common stock subject to the option. -3- item 1. security and issuer this statement relates to shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share (the "rykoff common stock"), of rykoff- sexton, inc. ("rykoff"). the address of rykoff's principal executive offices is 613 baltimore drive, wilkes-barre, pennsylvania 18702. item 2. identity and background (a) - (c) and (f). this schedule 13d is being filed by jp foodservice, inc., a corporation organized and existing un- der the laws of the state of delaware ("jp"). jp is a broad- line distributor of food and related products to restaurants and other institutional foodservice establishments primarily in the mid-atlantic, midwestern and northeastern regions of the united states. jp's principal business and offices are located at 9830 patuxent woods drive, columbia, maryland 21046. each executive officer and each director of jp is a citi- zen of the united states. the name, business address, and present principal occupation of each executive officer and di- rector is set forth in annex a to this schedule 13d and spe- cifically incorporated herein by reference. other than executive officers and directors, there are no persons or corporations controlling or ultimately in control of jp. (d) - (e). during the last five years, neither jp nor, to the best knowledge of jp, any executive officer or director of jp, has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of com- petent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding has been or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration pursuant to the rykoff stock option agreement described in item 4 (the "rykoff stock option agreement"), rykoff has granted to jp the option to purchase up to 5,564,140 shares of rykoff common stock at a price of $25.305 per share, exercis- able only upon the occurrence of certain events. the exercise of the option to purchase the full number of shares of rykoff common stock currently covered thereby would require aggregate funds of approximately $140,800,563. if jp were to purchase -4- shares of rykoff common stock pursuant to the rykoff stock op- tion agreement, jp currently anticipates that such funds would be provided from jp's working capital and from borrowings from other sources yet to be determined. item 4. purpose of transaction on june 30, 1997, jp, hudson acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of jp ("acquisition corp."), and rykoff entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which rykoff will be merged with and into acquisition corp. (the "merger"). as a result of the merger, each outstanding share of rykoff common stock (excluding treasury and certain other shares) will be converted into 0.84 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of jp ("jp common stock"). consummation of the merger would result in the rykoff common stock ceasing to be listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and the termination of registration of such securities pursuant to the act. the merger will be a tax-free reorganization and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. the merger is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the merger agreement. the merger agreement is included as exhibit 1 hereto and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. as a condition and inducement to jp's entering into the merger agreement (and a reciprocal stock option agreement), rykoff entered into the rykoff stock option agreement with jp. pursuant to the rykoff stock option agreement, rykoff has granted to jp the option to purchase up to 5,564,140 shares (the "option shares") of rykoff common stock at a price of $25.305 per share, exercisable only upon the occurrence of cer- tain events. the number of option shares is subject to adjust- ment by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapital- ization, merger, rights offering, share exchange or other change in the corporate or capital structure of rykoff. under certain circumstances set forth in the rykoff stock option agreement, jp, as grantee of the option, may surrender the op- tion to rykoff in exchange for a formula payment based on the difference (reduced by the amount of any termination fee paid by rykoff to jp pursuant to the merger agreement) between (x) the price paid to rykoff or its stockholders in certain compet- ing transactions involving the acquisition of rykoff and (y) the exercise price of the option. the rykoff stock option agreement is included as exhibit 2 hereto and is hereby incor- porated herein by reference. -5- pursuant to the merger agreement, the directors and offic- ers of acquisition corp. immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will be the initial directors and officers of the wholly-owned subsidiary of jp that will be the surviving corpo- ration in the merger, each to hold office in accordance with the surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation and by-laws. the merger agreement also provides that the certifi- cate of incorporation and by-laws of acquisition corp., as in effect immediately prior to consummation of the merger, will be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of such surviving corporation in the merger, in each case until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law, except that article first of the certificate of incorporation of the surviving cor- poration shall be amended to provide that the name of the sur- viving corporation shall be "rykoff-sexton, inc." pursuant to the merger agreement, rykoff has agreed, dur- ing the period prior to the effective time, that neither it nor its subsidiaries shall pay dividends except for semi-annual cash dividends on rykoff common stock not in excess of $0.03 per share and certain intercompany dividends. except as set forth in this item 4, jp has no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement and the rykoff stock option agreement, copies of which are filed as exhibits hereto, is not intended to be com- plete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) and (b). pursuant to the rykoff stock option agree- ment, jp has the right, exercisable only in certain circum- stances, none of which has occurred as of the date hereof, to acquire up to 5,564,140 shares of rykoff common stock (subject to adjustment as described in item 4), which represents benefi- cial ownership of approximately 19.9% of the shares of rykoff common stock currently outstanding. if jp were to acquire such shares, it would have sole voting and investment power with respect thereto. because of the limited circumstances in which the option granted under the rykoff option agreement is exer- cisable, jp disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares of rykoff common stock subject to the rykoff stock option agree- ment. in addition, in connection with the proposed merger, jp has entered into a support agreement with certain stockholders of rykoff. see item 6. -6- to the best of its knowledge, no executive officer or di- rector of jp beneficially owns any shares of rykoff common stock. (c) except to the extent of transactions in a fiduciary capacity, there have been no transactions in shares of rykoff common stock by jp, or, to the best knowledge of jp, any of jp's executive officers and directors during the past 60 days. (d) as described in item 6, the ml investors (as defined in item 6) may be deemed to be beneficial owners of shares of rykoff common stock and, subject to the support agreement de- scribed therein, have the right to receive dividends and pro- ceeds from the sale of such shares. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relation- ships with respect to securities of the issuer on june 30, 1997, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, certain stockholders of rykoff (the "ml investors"), holding in the aggregate approximately 36.4% of the outstanding shares (the "ml shares") of rykoff common stock as of such date, entered into a support agreement (the "support agreement"), dated as of june 30, 1997, with jp, and acknowl- edged by rykoff. the ml entities are comprised of merrill lynch capital partners, inc., merrill lynch capital apprecia- tion partnership no. b-xviii, l.p., merrill lynch kecalp l.p. 1994, ml offshore lbo partnership no. b-xviii, ml ibk posi- tions, inc., mlcp associates l.p. no. ii, mlcp associates l.p. no. iv, merrill lynch kecalp l.p. 1991, merrill lynch capital appreciation partnership no. xiii, l.p., ml offshore lbo part- nership no. xiii, ml employees lbo partnership no. i, l.p., merrill lynch kecalp l.p. 1987 and merchant banking l.p. no. ii. pursuant to the support agreement, each ml investor has agreed to vote all shares of rykoff common stock held by it for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger at the meeting of the stockholders of rykoff to be called and held to consider such adoption and approval. in addition, the ml investors have agreed not to take certain actions during the term of the support agreement (or certain periods thereof) re- lating to the disposition of the businesses or assets of rykoff or jp or their respective subsidiaries, or the acquisition of the voting securities of rykoff or jp or their respective sub- sidiaries, or the merger or consolidation of rykoff or jp or any of their respective subsidiaries with or into any corpora- tion or other entity, other than the merger or related transac- tions. the support agreement will terminate in the event that -7- the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. jp disclaims beneficial ownership of the ml shares. the preceding summary of the support agreement is quali- fied in its entirety by reference to the full text of such sup- port agreement, which is included as exhibit 3 hereto and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. a copy of the rykoff stock option agreement is in- cluded as exhibit 2 hereto and is incorporated herein by refer- ence. the rights and obligations of rykoff and jp under the rykoff stock option agreement are subject to all required regu- latory approvals. a copy of the merger agreement is included as exhibit 1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. except as set forth in items 3, 4, 5 and 6, neither jp nor, to the best knowledge of jp, any of its directors or executive officers has any contracts, arrangements, understand- ings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any other per- son with respect to any securities of rykoff. item 7. materials to be filed as exhibits 1. agreement and plan of merger, dated as of june 30, 1997, by and among jp foodservice, inc., hudson ac- quisition corp. and rykoff-sexton, inc. 2. stock option agreement, dated as of june 30, 1997, by and between rykoff-sexton, inc., as issuer, and jp foodservice, inc., as grantee 3. support agreement, dated as of june 30, 1997, by and between jp foodservice, inc. on the one hand, and the stockholders of rykoff-sexton, inc. listed on the signature pages thereto, on the other hand, and acknowledged by rykoff-sexton, inc. -8- signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge and belief, the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. july 3, 1997 jp foodservice, inc. /s/ david m. abramson david m. abramson senior vice president and general counsel -9- annex a identity and background the following table sets forth the names, addresses and principal occupations of the executive officers and directors of jp foodservice, inc.

and (4) such consents, approv- als, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be made or obtained individually or in the aggregate would not (x) have a material adverse effect on rsi or (y) reasonably be expected to impair the ability of rsi to perform its obligations under this agreement. the entry into the support agreement by the stockholders (as defined in the support agreement) and the con- summation of the transactions contemplated thereby has been approved by the rsi board of directors in the manner contem- plated by section 3.1(a) of that certain standstill agreement (the "standstill agreement"), dated as of may 17, 1996, by and -16- between rsi and the ml entities (as defined therein). the en- try into this agreement and the consummation of the transac- tions contemplated hereby has been agreed to by a majority of the ml directors (as defined in the standstill agreement) for all purposes of the standstill agreement as may be relevant to effecting the transactions contemplated by this agreement and the support agreement (including, without limitation, section 2.2(a) thereof). (e) sec documents; undisclosed liabilities. rsi has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses, re- ports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (in- cluding exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) with the sec since december 31, 1994 (the "rsi sec documents"). as of their respective dates, the rsi sec docu- ments complied in all material respects with the requirements of the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), or the exchange act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the sec promulgated thereunder applicable to such rsi sec documents, and none of the rsi sec documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislead- ing. the financial statements of rsi included in the rsi sec documents comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the sec, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the sec with respect thereto, have been prepared in ac- cordance with gaap (except, in the case of unaudited state- ments, as permitted by form 10-q of the sec) applied on a con- sistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consoli- dated financial position of rsi and its consolidated subsid- iaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year- end audit adjustments). rsi has not treated as restructuring charges any significant expenses that rsi would otherwise have expensed against operating income in the ordinary course of business. except (i) as reflected in such financial statements or in the notes thereto or (ii) for liabilities incurred in connection with this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on rsi. (f) information supplied. none of the information supplied or to be supplied by rsi specifically for inclusion or -17- incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement on form s-4 to be filed with the sec by jpfi in connection with the issuance of jpfi common stock in the merger (the "form s-4") will, at the time the form s-4 becomes effective under the securities act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not mis- leading or (ii) the joint proxy statement will, at the date it is first mailed to rsi's stockholders or at the time of the rsi stockholders meeting, contain any untrue statement of a mate- rial fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. the joint proxy statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by rsi with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by jpfi specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the joint proxy statement. (g) absence of certain changes or events. except for liabilities incurred in connection with this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and except as permitted by section 4.1(a), since april 27, 1996, rsi and its subsidiaries have conducted their busi- ness only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice or as disclosed in any rsi sec document filed since such date and prior to the date hereof, and there has not been (i) any material adverse change (as defined in section 8.3) in rsi, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any of rsi's capital stock, (iii) any split, combi- nation or reclassification of any of rsi's capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other se- curities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of rsi's capital stock, except for issuances of rsi com- mon stock upon exercise or conversion of rsi employee stock options, in each case awarded prior to the date hereof in ac- cordance with their present terms or issued pursuant to section 4.1(a), (iv)(a) any granting by rsi or any of its subsidiaries to any current or former director, executive officer or other key employee of rsi or its subsidiaries of any increase in com- pensation, bonus or other benefits, except for normal increases as a result of promotions, normal increases of base pay in the ordinary course of business or as was required under any em- ployment agreements in effect as of april 27, 1996 or disclosed in section 3.1(i) of the rsi disclosure schedule, (b) any granting by rsi or any of its subsidiaries to any such current or former director, executive officer or key employee of any -18- increase in severance or termination pay, or (c) any entry by rsi or any of its subsidiaries into, or any amendment of, any employment, deferred compensation, consulting, severance, ter- mination or indemnification agreement with any such current or former director, executive officer or key employee, (v) except insofar as may have been disclosed in rsi sec documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the "rsi filed sec documents") or required by a change in gaap, any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by rsi materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, (vi) except insofar as may have been disclosed in the rsi filed sec documents, any tax election that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on rsi or any of its tax attributes or any settlement or compromise of any material income tax liability, or (vii) any action taken by rsi or any of the rsi subsidiaries during the period from april 28, 1996 through the date of this agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this agree- ment through the effective time, would constitute a breach of section 4.1(a). (h) compliance with applicable laws; litigation. (i) rsi, its subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, li- censes, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and ap- provals of all governmental entities which are required for the operation of the businesses of rsi and its subsidiaries (the "rsi permits"), except where the failure to have any such rsi permits individually or in the aggregate would not have a mate- rial adverse effect on rsi. rsi and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the rsi permits and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, except where the failure so to comply individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. as of the date of this agreement, except as disclosed in the rsi filed sec docu- ments, no action, demand, requirement or investigation by any governmental entity and no suit, action or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to rsi or any of its subsid- iaries or any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge (as defined in section 8.3) of rsi, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which individu- ally or in the aggregate would not (a) have a material adverse effect on rsi or (b) reasonably be expected to impair the abil- ity of rsi to perform its obligations under this agreement or the option agreements or prevent or materially delay the con- summation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. (ii) neither rsi nor any rsi subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, injunction or decree which has had or, -19- insofar as can be reasonably foreseen, individually or in the aggregate will have, a material adverse effect on rsi. (i) absence of changes in benefit plans. rsi has delivered to jpfi true and complete copies of (i) all severance and employment agreements of rsi with directors, executive of- ficers or key employees, (ii) all severance programs and poli- cies of each of rsi and each rsi subsidiary, and (iii) all plans or arrangements of rsi and each rsi subsidiary relating to its employees which contain change in control provisions, in each case which has not been filed as an exhibit to a rsi filed sec document. since april 27, 1996, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by rsi or any of its subsidiaries of any collective bargaining agreement, em- ployment agreement, consulting agreement, severance agreement or any material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred com- pensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock pur- chase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, sev- erance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of rsi or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "rsi benefit plans"), or any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any rsi pension plans, or any material change in the manner in which contributions to any rsi pension plans are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined. since april 27, 1996, neither rsi nor any rsi subsidiary has amended any rsi employee stock options or any rsi stock plans to ac- celerate the vesting of, or release restrictions on, awards thereunder, or to provide for such acceleration in the event of a change in control. (j) erisa compliance. (i) with respect to the rsi benefit plans, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of rsi, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in con- nection with which rsi or any of its subsidiaries could be sub- ject to any liability that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on rsi under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended ("erisa"), the code or any other applicable law. (ii) each rsi benefit plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, except for any failures so to admin- ister any rsi benefit plan that individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. rsi, its subsidiaries and all the rsi benefit plans have been oper- ated, and are, in compliance with the applicable provisions of erisa, the code and all other applicable laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any -20- failures to be in such compliance that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. each rsi benefit plan that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the code has received a favorable determination letter from the internal revenue service ("irs") that it is so qualified and each trust established in connec- tion with any rsi benefit plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(a) of the code has received a determination letter from the irs that such trust is so exempt. to the knowledge of rsi, no fact or event has occurred since the date of any determination letter from the irs which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such rsi benefit plan or the exempt status of any such trust. (iii) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has in- curred any unsatisfied liability under title iv of erisa (other than liability for premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation arising in the ordinary course). no rsi benefit plan has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of section 302 of erisa or section 412 of the code) whether or not waived. to the knowledge of rsi, there are not any facts or circumstances that would materially change the funded status of any rsi benefit plan that is a "defined ben- efit" plan (as defined in section 3(35) of erisa) since the date of the most recent actuarial report for such plan. each rsi benefit plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section 3(37) of erisa is set forth on section 3.1(j)(iii) of the rsi disclosure schedule. (iv) with respect to each of the rsi benefit plans (other than any multiemployer plan) that is subject to title iv of erisa, the present value of accrued benefits under each such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to such plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the aggregate assets of such plans allocable to such accrued bene- fits in any material respect. with respect to any rsi benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan, (a) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has any contingent liability under section 4204 of erisa, and no circumstances exist that present a mate- rial risk that any such plan will go into reorganization, and (b) the aggregate withdrawal liability of rsi and its subsid- iaries, computed as if a complete withdrawal by rsi and any of its subsidiaries had occurred under each such rsi benefit plan on the date hereof, would not be material. (v) no rsi benefit plan provides medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former -21- employees after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable law or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the current or former em- ployee) other than individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material. (vi) rsi has previously provided to jpfi a copy of each collective bargaining or other labor union contract ap- plicable to persons employed by rsi or any of its subsidiaries to which rsi or any of its subsidiaries is a party. no collec- tive bargaining agreement is being negotiated or renegotiated by rsi or any of its subsidiaries. as of the date of this agreement, there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against rsi or any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of rsi, threatened which may interfere with the re- spective business activities of rsi or any of its subsidiaries, except where such dispute, strike or work stoppage individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. as of the date of this agreement, to the knowledge of rsi, none of rsi, any of its subsidiaries or any of their re- spective representatives or employees has committed any mate- rial unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of rsi or any of its subsidiaries, and there is no material charge or complaint against rsi or any of its subsidiaries by the national labor relations board or any comparable governmental agency pending or threatened in writing. (vii) no employee of rsi will be entitled to any mate- rial payment, additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any rsi ben- efit plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as a termination of employment), except that substantially all rsi employee stock options will vest as of the date on which rsi stockholder approval is obtained. (k) taxes. (i) each of rsi and its subsidiaries has filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable extensions) and all such returns and reports are complete and correct in all material respects, or requests for extensions to file such re- turns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. rsi and each of its subsidiar- ies has paid (or rsi has paid or caused to be paid on its be- half) all taxes (as defined herein) shown as due on such re- turns, and the most recent financial statements contained in -22- the rsi filed sec documents reflect an adequate reserve in ac- cordance with gaap for all taxes payable by rsi and its subsid- iaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. (ii) no deficiencies for any taxes have, to the knowledge of rsi, been proposed, asserted or assessed against rsi or any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies that individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. the federal income tax returns of rsi and each of its subsidiaries consolidated in such returns for tax years through 1993 (1992 in the case of u.s. foodservice and its subsidiaries) have closed by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations. (iii) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of sec- tion 368(a) of the code. (iv) as used in this agreement, "taxes" shall include all (x) federal, state, local or foreign income, property, sales, excise and other taxes or similar governmental charges, including any interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto, (y) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in (x) as a result of being a member of an af- filiated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (z) li- ability for the payment of any amounts described in (x) or (y) as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (x) or (y). (l) voting requirements. the affirmative vote at the rsi stockholders meeting (the "rsi stockholder approval") of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of rsi common stock to adopt this agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of rsi's capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this agreement and the transactions con- templated hereby, including the merger. (m) state takeover statutes; certain provisions of rsi certificate. the board of directors of rsi has adopted a resolution or resolutions approving this agreement and the op- tion agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and, assuming the accuracy of jpfi's representation and warranty contained in section 3.2(q), (a) such approval consti- tutes approval of the merger and the other transactions contem- plated hereby and by the option agreements by the rsi board of -23- directors under (i) the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl such that section 203 of the dgcl does not apply to this agree- ment, the option agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) section a.2. of article fourteenth of the rsi certificate such that the 80% vote otherwise re- quired by article fourteenth does not apply to this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and (b) for purposes of article twelfth of the rsi certificate ("article twelfth"), such approval constitutes ap- proval of this agreement and the option agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the rsi board of directors has conclusively determined, pursuant to article twelfth, that such agreements together constitute the "memoran- dum of understanding" contemplated by article twelfth) for pur- poses of section b of article twelfth such that the 80% vote otherwise required by article twelfth does not apply to this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contem- plated hereby or thereby. to the knowledge of rsi, except for section 203 of the dgcl (which has been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to the merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. (n) accounting matters. to its knowledge, neither rsi nor any of its affiliates (as such term is used in section 5.10) has taken or agreed to take any action (including, with- out limitation, in connection with any rsi stock plan or any agreement thereunder) that would prevent the business combi- nation to be effected by the merger from being accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and rsi has no reason to believe that the merger will not qualify for "pooling of interests" account- ing. (o) brokers. no broker, investment banker, finan- cial advisor or other person other than merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated ("merrill lynch") and wasserstein perella & co., inc. ("wasserstein") , the fees and expenses of which will be paid by rsi, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commis- sion in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of rsi. rsi has furnished to jpfi true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are payable. (p) opinions of financial advisors. rsi has re- ceived the opinions of merrill lynch and wasserstein, each dated the date of this agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio for the conversion of rsi common stock into jpfi common stock is fair from a financial point of -24- view to holders of shares of rsi common stock (other than jpfi and its affiliates), signed copies of which opinions have been delivered to jpfi, it being understood and agreed by jpfi that such opinions are for the benefit of the board of directors of rsi and may not be relied upon by jpfi, its affiliates or any of their respective stockholders. (q) ownership of jpfi common stock. to the knowl- edge of rsi, as of the date hereof (and before giving effect to the jpfi option agreement, which will be entered into im- mediately after the execution of this agreement), neither rsi nor, to its knowledge without independent investigation, any of its affiliates, (i) beneficially owns (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act), directly or indirectly, or (ii) is party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, shares of capital stock of jpfi. (r) intellectual property. rsi and its subsidiaries own or have a valid license to use all trademarks, service marks, trade names, patents and copyrights (including any reg- istrations or applications for registration of any of the fore- going) (collectively, the "rsi intellectual property") neces- sary to carry on its business substantially as currently con- ducted except for such rsi intellectual property the failure of which to own or validly license individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. nei- ther rsi nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of in- fringement of or conflict with, and, to rsi's knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts (i) with the rights of others with respect to the use of, or (ii) by others with re- spect to, any rsi intellectual property that individually or in the aggregate, in either such case, would have a material ad- verse effect on rsi. (s) certain contracts. except as set forth in the rsi filed sec documents, neither rsi nor any of its subsidiar- ies is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of regulation s-k of the sec), (ii) any non-competition agreement or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit in any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any material portion of the business of rsi and its subsidiar- ies (including, for purposes of this section 3.1(s), jpfi and its subsidiaries, assuming the merger has taken place), taken as a whole, is or would be conducted, (iii) any exclusive sup- ply or purchase contracts or any exclusive requirements con- tracts or (iv) any contract or other agreement which would pro- hibit or materially delay the consummation of the merger or any -25- of the transactions contemplated by this agreement (all con- tracts of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) being re- ferred to herein as "rsi material contracts"). rsi has deliv- ered to jpfi, prior to the execution of this agreement, com- plete and correct copies of all rsi material contracts not filed as exhibits to the rsi filed sec documents. each rsi material contract is valid and binding on rsi (or, to the ex- tent a rsi subsidiary is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and rsi and each rsi subsidiary have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each rsi material contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in the ag- gregate, would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. nei- ther rsi nor any rsi subsidiary knows of, or has received no- tice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of rsi, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any rsi material contract. (t) rsi rights agreement. rsi has taken all action (including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding pre- ferred stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the rsi rights agreement or amending the rsi rights agreement) so that the entering into of this agreement, the rsi option agreement and the support agreement, the merger, the acquisition of shares pursuant to the rsi option agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the rsi rights agreement or enable or require the rsi rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. (u) environmental liability. there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or reme- diation activities or governmental investigations of any nature pending or threatened against rsi or any of its subsidiaries seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be expected to re- sult in the imposition of, on rsi or any of its subsidiaries, any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including, without limitation, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, as amended ("cercla"), which liability or obligation could rea- sonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on rsi. to the knowledge of rsi, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that could rea- sonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on rsi. -26- section 3.2. representations and warranties of jpfi and merger sub. except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by jpfi and merger sub to rsi prior to the execution of this agreement (the "jpfi disclosure schedule") and making reference to the particular subsection of this agreement to which exception is being taken, jpfi and merger sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to rsi as follows: (a) organization, standing and corporate power. (i) each of jpfi and its subsidiaries is a corporation or other le- gal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good stand- ing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such con- cept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is orga- nized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now be- ing conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those jurisdic- tions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing individually or in the aggregate would not have a ma- terial adverse effect on jpfi. each of jpfi and its subsidiar- ies is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its busi- ness or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. (ii) jpfi has delivered to rsi prior to the execution of this agreement complete and correct copies of any amendments to its certificate of incorporation (the "jpfi certificate") and by-laws not filed as of the date hereof with the jpfi filed sec documents (as defined in section 3.2(g)). (iii) in all material respects, the minute books of jpfi and its subsidiaries contain accurate records of all meet- ings and accurately reflect all other actions taken by the stockholders, the board of directors and all committees of the board of directors of jpfi (or, as the case may be, each of its subsidiaries) since january 1, 1995.

(h) compliance with applicable laws; litigation. (i) jpfi, its subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, li- censes, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and ap- provals of all governmental entities which are required for the operation of the businesses of jpfi and its subsidiaries (the "jpfi permits") except where the failure to have any such jpfi permits individually or in the aggregate would not have a mate- rial adverse effect on jpfi. jpfi and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the jpfi permits and all ap- plicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, except where the failure so to comply individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. as of the date of this agreement, except as disclosed in the jpfi filed sec documents, no action, demand, requirement or investi- gation by any governmental entity and no suit, action or pro- ceeding by any person, in each case with respect to jpfi or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge of jpfi, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which individually or in the aggregate would not (a) have a material adverse effect on jpfi or (b) reasonably be expected to impair the ability of jpfi or merger sub to perform its obligations under this agreement or the option agreements or prevent or materially delay the con- summation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. -33- (ii) neither jpfi nor any jpfi subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, injunction or decree which has had or, insofar as can be reasonably foreseen, individually or in the aggregate will have, a material adverse effect on jpfi. (i) absence of changes in benefit plans. jpfi has delivered to rsi true and complete copies of (i) all severance and employment agreements of jpfi with directors, executive of- ficers or key employees, (ii) all severance programs and poli- cies of each of jpfi and each jpfi subsidiary, and (iii) all plans or arrangements of jpfi and each jpfi subsidiary relating to its employees which contain change in control provisions, in each case which has not been filed as an exhibit to the jpfi filed sec documents. since june 29, 1996, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by jpfi or any of its subsidiaries of any collective bargaining agreement, employment agreement, consulting agreement, severance agreement or any material bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred com- pensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock pur- chase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, sev- erance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of jpfi or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "jpfi benefit plans"), or any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any jpfi pension plans, or any material change in the manner in which contributions to any jpfi pension plans are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined. since june 29, 1996, neither jpfi nor any jpfi subsidiary has amended any jpfi employee stock options or any jpfi stock plans to accelerate the vesting of, or release restrictions on, awards thereunder, or to provide for such acceleration in the event of a change in control. (j) erisa compliance. (i) with respect to the jpfi benefit plans, no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of jpfi, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which jpfi or any of its subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on jpfi under erisa, the code or any other applicable law. (ii) each jpfi benefit plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, except for any failures so to admin- ister any jpfi benefit plan that individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. jpfi, its subsidiaries and all the jpfi benefit plans have been operated, and are, in compliance with the applicable provisions of erisa, the code and all other applicable laws and the terms -34- of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such compliance that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. each jpfi benefit plan that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the code has received a favorable determination letter from the irs that it is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any jpfi benefit plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation un- der section 501(a) of the code has received a determination letter from the irs that such trust is so exempt. to the knowledge of jpfi, no fact or event has occurred since the date of any determination letter from the irs which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such jpfi benefit plan or the exempt status of any such trust. (iii) neither jpfi nor any of its subsidiaries has in- curred any unsatisfied liability under title iv of erisa (other than liability for premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation arising in the ordinary course). no jpfi benefit plan has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of section 302 of erisa or section 412 of the code) whether or not waived. to the knowledge of jpfi, there are not any facts or circumstances that would materially change the funded status of any jpfi benefit plan that is a "defined ben- efit" plan (as defined in section 3(35) of erisa) since the date of the most recent actuarial report for such plan. (iv) with respect to each of the jpfi benefit plans (other than any multiemployer plan) that is subject to title iv of erisa, the present value of accrued benefits under each such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to such plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the aggregate assets of such plans allocable to such accrued bene- fits in any material respect. with respect to any jpfi benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan, (a) neither jpfi nor any of its subsidiaries has any contingent liability under section 4204 of erisa, and no circumstances exist that present a mate- rial risk that any such plan will go into reorganization, and (b) the aggregate withdrawal liability of jpfi and its subsid- iaries, computed as if a complete withdrawal by jpfi and any of its subsidiaries had occurred under each such jpfi benefit plan on the date hereof, would not be material. (v) no jpfi benefit plan provides medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable law or benefits, -35- the full cost of which is borne by the current or former em- ployee) other than individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material. (vi) jpfi has previously provided to rsi a copy of each collective bargaining or other labor union contract ap- plicable to persons employed by jpfi or any of its subsidiaries to which jpfi or any of its subsidiaries is a party. no col- lective bargaining agreement is being negotiated or renegoti- ated by jpfi or any of its subsidiaries. as of the date of this agreement, there is no labor dispute, strike or work stop- page against jpfi or any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of jpfi, threatened which may interfere with the re- spective business activities of jpfi or any of its subsidiar- ies, except where such dispute, strike or work stoppage indi- vidually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. as of the date of this agreement, to the knowledge of jpfi, none of jpfi, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees has committed any material unfair labor practice in connection with the op- eration of the respective businesses of jpfi or any of its sub- sidiaries, and there is no material charge or complaint against jpfi or any of its subsidiaries by the national labor relations board or any comparable governmental agency pending or threat- ened in writing. (vii) no employee of jpfi will be entitled to any ma- terial payment, additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any jpfi ben- efit plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as a termination of employment). (k) taxes. (i) each of jpfi and its subsidiaries has filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (taking into account applicable extensions) and all such returns and reports are complete and correct in all mate- rial respects, or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not ex- pired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. jpfi and each of its subsid- iaries has paid (or jpfi has paid or caused to be paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the jpfi filed sec documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with gaap for all taxes payable by jpfi and its subsidiaries for all tax- able periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. -36- (ii) no deficiencies for any taxes have, to the knowledge of jpfi, been proposed, asserted or assessed against jpfi or any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately re- served for, except for deficiencies that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. none of the federal income tax returns of jpfi and each of its subsidiaries consolidated in such returns have closed by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations. (iii) neither jpfi nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of sec- tion 368(a) of the code. (l) voting requirements. the affirmative vote at the jpfi stockholders meeting (the "jpfi stockholder approval") of the holders of a majority of shares of jpfi common stock present in person or by proxy at a duly convened and held meet- ing of jpfi stockholders is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of jpfi's capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger and the issuance of the jpfi com- mon stock pursuant to the merger. (m) state takeover statutes; certificate of incorpo- ration. the board of directors of jpfi has approved this agreement, the option agreements, the support agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and, assuming the accuracy of rsi's representation and warranty contained in sec- tion 3.1(q), such approval constitutes approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the jpfi board of directors under the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl such that section 203 does not apply to this agree- ment, the option agreements, the support agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. to the knowledge of jpfi, no state takeover statute other than section 203 of the dgcl (which has been rendered inapplicable) is applicable to the merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. (n) accounting matters. to its knowledge, neither jpfi nor any of its affiliates (as such term is used in section 5.10) has taken or agreed to take any action (including, with- out limitation, in connection with any jpfi stock plan or any agreement thereunder) that would prevent the business combina- tion to be effected by the merger from being accounted for as a pooling of interests, and jpfi has no reason to believe that the merger will not qualify for "pooling of interest" account- ing. -37- (o) brokers. no broker, investment banker, finan- cial advisor or other person, other than goldman sachs & co. ("goldman"), smith barney inc. ("smith barney") and painewebber inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by jpfi, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transac- tions contemplated by this agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of jpfi. jpfi has furnished to rsi true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are payable. (p) opinions of financial advisors. jpfi has re- ceived the opinions of goldman and smith barney, each dated the date of this agreement, each to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio for the conversion of rsi common stock into jpfi common stock is fair from a financial point of view to jpfi, signed copies of which opinions have been delivered to rsi, it being understood and agreed by rsi that such opinions are for the benefit of the board of directors of jpfi and may not be relied upon by rsi, its affiliates or any of their re- spective stockholders. (q) ownership of rsi common stock. to the knowledge of jpfi, as of the date hereof or at any time within twelve months prior to the date of this agreement (and before giving effect to the rsi option agreement, which will be entered into immediately after the execution of this agreement) neither jpfi nor, to its knowledge without independent investigation, any of its affiliates, (i) beneficially owns (as defined in either rule 13d-3 under the exchange act or in article fourteenth of the rsi certificate of incorporation) or owned, directly or in- directly, or (ii) is or was party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, shares of capital stock of rsi. (r) intellectual property. jpfi and its subsidiar- ies own or have a valid license to use all trademarks, service marks, trade names, patents and copyrights (including any reg- istrations or applications for registration of any of the fore- going) (collectively, the "jpfi intellectual property") neces- sary to carry on its business substantially as currently con- ducted, except for such jpfi intellectual property the failure of which to own or validly license individually or in the ag- gregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. nei- ther jpfi nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and, to jpfi's knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts (i) with the rights of others with respect to the use of, or (ii) by others with -38- respect to, any jpfi intellectual property that individually or in the aggregate, in either such case, would have a material adverse effect on jpfi.

(a) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in section 9 of this stock option agree- ment, prior to the termination of this stock option agreement in accordance with its terms, grantee or its designee (which shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee) may exercise the option, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on or after the public disclosure of, or the time at which grantee shall have learned of, the earliest event to occur of the following: (i) any person or group (1) other than grantee, its affiliates or the ml entities (as such term is defined in that certain standstill agreement (the "standstill agreement"), dated as of may 17, 1996, by and among issuer and the other persons listed on the signature pages thereto) shall have acquired or be- come the beneficial owners (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock, or (2) other than grantee or its affiliates shall have been granted any option or right, conditional or otherwise, to acquire more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of issuer common stock (provided that in the event that such option or right expires unexercised, then to the extent the option has not already been exercised, it shall no longer be exercisable except as otherwise provided in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this section 2(a)); (ii) the ml entities and their affiliates in the aggregate (1) shall have acquired or become the ben- eficial owners (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 un- der the exchange act) of a percentage of the out- standing shares of issuer common stock greater than the sum of (a) the ml entities' proportionate owner- ship of such outstanding issuer common stock on the date hereof and (b) the additional percentage (as defined in the standstill agreement) to the extent acquired pursuant to section 3.1(c) of the standstill agreement, or (2) shall have been granted any option or right, conditional or otherwise, other than any such option or right in existence immediately prior to the date hereof and previously disclosed to grantee, to acquire any outstanding shares of issuer common stock that, together with any other shares of issuer common stock then beneficially owned by such ml entities, would exceed the sum of (a) the ml enti- ties' proportionate ownership of such outstanding shares of issuer common stock on the date hereof and (b) the additional percentage to the extent acquired - 2 - pursuant to section 3.1(c) of the standstill agree- ment (provided that in the event that such option or right expires unexercised, then to the extent the option has not already been exercised, it shall no longer be exercisable except as otherwise provided in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this section 2(a)); (iii) any person other than grantee and its af- filiates shall have made a tender offer or exchange offer (or entered into an agreement to make such a tender offer or exchange offer) for at least twenty percent (20%) of the then outstanding shares of is- suer common stock (provided that in the event that such tender offer or exchange offer or agreement is withdrawn or terminates, as the case may be, prior to consummation of such offer or the transactions con- templated by such agreement, then to the extent the option has not already been exercised, it shall no longer be exercisable except as otherwise provided in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this section 2(a)); (iv) issuer shall have entered into a written definitive agreement or written agreement in prin- ciple with any person other than grantee or its af- filiates in connection with a liquidation, dissolu- tion, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or ac- quisition or purchase of all or a material portion of the assets of issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or all or a material portion of the equity in- terest in issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or other similar transaction or business com- bination (each, an "acquisition transaction"); or (v) any person other than grantee or its af- filiates shall have made a proposal to issuer or its stockholders to engage in an acquisition transaction. (b) in the event grantee wishes to exercise the op- tion at such time as the option is exercisable, grantee shall deliver written notice (the "exercise notice") to issuer speci- fying its intention to exercise the option, the total number of option shares it wishes to purchase and a date and time for the closing of such purchase (a "closing") not less than three (3) nor more than thirty (30) business days after the later of (i) the date such exercise notice is given and (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hart- scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the "hsr act"). if prior to the expiration date (as defined in section 11 below) any person or group (other than grantee or its affiliates) (1) shall have made a bona fide proposal that becomes publicly disclosed with respect to (i) a tender offer or exchange offer for fifty percent (50%) or more of the then - 3 - outstanding shares of issuer common stock (a "share proposal"), (ii) a merger, consolidation or other business combination with issuer (a "merger proposal") or (iii) any acquisition of a ma- terial portion of the assets of issuer (an "asset proposal"), or (2) shall have acquired fifty percent (50%) or more of the then outstanding shares of issuer common stock (a "share acqui- sition"), and this option is then exercisable, then grantee, in lieu of exercising the option, shall have the right at any time thereafter (for so long as the option is exercisable under sec- tion 2(a)) to request in writing that issuer pay, and promptly (but in any event not more than five (5) business days) after the giving by grantee of such request, issuer shall, subject to section 2(c) below, pay to grantee, in cancellation of the op- tion, an amount in cash (the "cancellation amount") equal to (i) the excess over the option price of the greater of (a) the last sale price of a share of is- suer common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange on the last trading day prior to the date of the exercise notice, or (b)(1) the highest price per share of issuer common stock offered or proposed to be paid or paid by any such person or group pursuant to or in connection with a share proposal, a share acquisition or a merger proposal or (2) the aggregate consideration offered to be paid or paid in any transaction or proposed transaction in connection with an asset proposal, divided by the number of shares of issuer common stock then outstanding, mul- tiplied by (ii) the number of option shares then covered by the option; provided, however, that the cancellation amount shall be re- duced by any amount actually paid to grantee by issuer pursuant to section 7.5(b) of the merger agreement (the "termination fee"). if all or a portion of the price per share of issuer common stock offered, paid or payable or the aggregate con- sideration offered, paid or payable for the assets of issuer, each as contemplated by the preceding sentence, consists of noncash consideration, such price or aggregate consideration shall be the cash consideration, if any, plus the fair market value of the non-cash consideration as determined by the in- vestment bankers of issuer and the investment bankers of grantee (or, if such investment bankers cannot agree within ten (10) business days of such question being submitted for such determination, then promptly by an independent investment banker chosen by grantee's investment bankers and reasonably acceptable to issuer's investment bankers). (c) following exercise of the option by grantee, in the event that grantee sells, pledges or otherwise disposes of (including, without limitation, by merger or exchange) any of the option shares (a "sale"), then any termination fee due and - 4 - payable by issuer following such time shall be reduced to the extent of the amounts received (whether in cash, loan proceeds, securities or otherwise) by grantee in such sale less the exer- cise price of such option shares sold in the sale (the "option share profit"); provided, however, that in no event shall the termination fee be reduced below zero. if issuer has paid to grantee the termination fee prior to a sale, then grantee shall immediately remit to issuer the option share profit realized in such sale, but only to the extent that such option share profit, in the aggregate with any other option share profit realized in a sale subsequent to payment of the termination fee, is less than or equal to the amount of the termination fee. 3. payment of option price and delivery of certifi- cate. (a) any closings under section 2 of this stock option agreement shall be held at the principal executive offices of issuer, or at such other place as issuer and grantee may agree. (b) subject to section 3(c), at any closing hereun- der, (x) grantee or its designee will make payment to issuer of the aggregate price for the option shares being so purchased by delivery of a certified check, official bank check or wire transfer of funds pursuant to issuer's instructions payable to issuer in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiply- ing the option price by the number of option shares to be pur- chased, and (y) upon receipt of such payment issuer will de- liver to grantee or its designee (which shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of grantee) a certificate or certificates represent- ing the number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable option shares so purchased, in the denominations and registered in such names (which shall be grantee or a wholly owned subsid- iary of grantee) designated to issuer in writing by grantee. (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any closing involving the payment of a cancellation amount, (x) grantee will deliver to issuer for cancellation the option and (y) issuer or its designee will make payment to grantee of the cancellation amount by delivery of a certified check, official bank check or wire transfer of funds pursuant to grantee's in- structions. 4. registration and listing of option shares. (a) issuer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as promptly as possible upon the request of gran- tee and (ii) cause to become and remain effective for a period of not less than six (6) months (or such shorter period as may be necessary to effect the distribution of such shares), the registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and any applicable state securities laws, of all or any part of the option shares as may be specified in such request; provided, however, that (i) grantee shall have - 5 - the right to select the managing underwriter for any underwrit- ten offering of such option shares after consultation with is- suer, which managing underwriter shall be reasonably acceptable to issuer and (ii) grantee shall not be entitled to more than two (2) effective registration statements hereunder. (b) in addition to such demand registrations, if issuer proposes to effect a registration of issuer common stock for its own account or for the account of any other stockholder of issuer, issuer will give prompt written notice to all hold- ers of options or option shares of its intention to do so and shall use its reasonable best efforts to include therein all option shares requested by grantee to be so included. no reg- istration effected under this section 4(b) shall relieve issuer of its obligations to effect demand registrations under section 4(a) hereof. (c) registrations effected under this section 4 shall be effected at issuer's expense, including the fees and expenses of counsel to the holder of options or option shares, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions to brokers or dealers. in connection with each registration under this section 4, issuer shall indemnify and hold each holder of op- tions or option shares participating in such offering (a "holder"), its underwriters and each of their respective af- filiates harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, inves- tigation expenses and fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants), joint or several, to which such holder, its un- derwriters and each of their respective affiliates may become subject, under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact con- tained in any registration statement (including any prospectus therein), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or neces- sary to make the statements therein not misleading, other than such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or ac- tions in respect thereof) which arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in written information furnished by a holder to issuer expressly for use in such registration statement. (d) in connection with any registration statement pursuant to this section 4, each holder agrees to furnish is- suer with such information concerning itself and the proposed sale or distribution as shall reasonably be required in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the securities act. in addition, grantee shall indemnify and hold issuer, its underwriters and each of their respective affiliates harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation investigation expenses - 6 - and fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants), joint or several, to which issuer, its underwriters and each of their respective affiliates may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, li- abilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in written information furnished by any holder to issuer expressly for use in such registration statement. in no event shall the liability of any holder or any affiliate thereof under this section 4 be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of pay- ment of all expenses) received by such holder upon the sale of the option shares giving rise to such indemnification obliga- tion. (e) upon the issuance of option shares hereunder, issuer will use its reasonable best efforts promptly to list such option shares with the new york stock exchange or on such national or other exchange on which the shares of issuer common stock are at the time principally listed. 5. representations and warranties of issuer. is- suer hereby represents and warrants to grantee as follows: (a) issuer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and has requisite power and authority to enter into and perform this stock option agreement.

(b) to the extent inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this section 1, each stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies with respect to such stockholder's subject shares or any other voting securities of rykoff. section 2. no solicitation. no stockholder shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or authorize any individual, corporation or other entity to solicit or encourage (includ- ing by way of furnishing information), from any third party any inquiries or proposals relating to, or conduct negotia- tions or discussions with any third party with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the mak- ing of any proposal that constitutes, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any proposal or offer relating to the disposition of business or assets of rykoff or jpfi or their respective subsidiaries, or the acquisition of the voting se- curities of rykoff or jpfi or their respective subsidiaries, or the merger or consolidation of rykoff or jpfi or any of their respective subsidiaries with or into any corporation or other entity other than as provided in the merger agreement, the option agreements or the support agreement (and the stockholders shall promptly notify jpfi of all of the rel- evant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which such stockholders may receive relating to any such matters). section 3. securities act covenants and represen- tations. each stockholder hereby agrees and represents to jpfi as follows: (a) such stockholder has been advised that the of- fering, sale and delivery of jpfi common stock pursuant to the merger will be registered under the securities act on a registration statement on form s-4. such stockholder has also been advised, however, that to the extent such stock- holder is considered an "affiliate" of rykoff at the time the merger agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of rykoff any public offering or sale by such stockholder of any shares of jpfi common stock received by such stockholder in the merger will, under current law, require either (i) the further registration under the securities act of any shares of jpfi common stock to be sold by such stockholder, (ii) compliance with rule 145 promulgated by the sec under the se- curities act or (iii) the availability of another exemption from such registration under the securities act. -2- (b) such stockholder has read this agreement and the merger agreement and has discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon such stockholder's ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of jpfi com- mon stock, to the extent such stockholder believed necessary, with such stockholder's counsel or counsel for rykoff. (c) such stockholder also understands that stop transfer instructions will be given to jpfi's transfer agent with respect to jpfi common stock and that a legend will be placed on the certificates for the jpfi common stock issued to such stockholder, or any substitutions therefor, to the extent such stockholder is considered an "affiliate" of rykoff at the time the merger agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of rykoff. section 4. pooling covenants and representations. each stockholder hereby agrees and represents to jpfi that such stockholder will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any securities of rykoff or of any shares of jpfi common stock received by such stockholder in the merger or other shares of capital stock of jpfi during the period beginning 30 days prior to the effective time and ending at such time as results covering at least 30 days of combined operations of rykoff and jpfi have been published by jpfi, in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement filed with the sec, a report to the sec on form 10-k, 10-q or 8-k, or any other public filing or announcement which includes the combined results of operations, except for transfers or other dispositions that, taking into account the actions of other affiliates of rykoff, will not prevent jpfi from accounting for the merger as a pooling of interests. section 5. further assurances. each of jpfi and the stockholders shall execute and deliver such additional instruments and other documents and shall take such further actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, carry out and comply with all of its obligations under this agreement. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of jpfi or any of the stockholders shall enter into any agreement or arrangement (or alter, amend or terminate any existing agreement or arrangement) if such action would mate- rially impair the ability of any party to effectuate, carry out or comply with all the terms of this agreement. section 6. representations and warranties of jpfi. jpfi represents and warrants to each stockholder as follows: -3- each of this agreement and the merger agreement has been ap- proved by the board of directors of jpfi, representing all necessary corporate action on the part of jpfi other than ap- proval of the merger agreement by the stockholders of jpfi. each of this agreement and the merger agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of jpfi. each of this agreement and the merger agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of jpfi, enforceable against jpfi in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by ap- plicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may af- fect the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. jpfi covenants and agrees that, effective as of the effective time, jpfi shall assume the rights and obligations of rykoff under that certain reg- istration rights agreement, dated as of may 17, 1996, by and among rykoff and the other persons whose signatures are set forth on the signature pages thereto pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to jpfi and such other persons. section 7. representations and warranties of stockholders. each stockholder represents and warrants to jpfi that this agreement (i) has been duly authorized, ex- ecuted and delivered by such stockholder and (ii) constitutes the valid and binding agreement of such stockholder, enforce- able against such stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insol- vency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may affect the enforcement of cred- itors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. each such stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the subject shares set forth opposite its respective name on schedule i. the subject shares listed next to the name of such stockholder on schedule i hereto are the only voting se- curities of rykoff owned (beneficially or of record) by such stockholder. neither the execution or delivery of this agreement nor the consummation by such stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate (a) the cer- tificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other organizational document, as applicable, of any such stockholder, or (b) any provisions of any law, rule or regu- lation applicable to such stockholder or any contract or agreement to which such stockholder is a party, other than such violations described in the foregoing clause (b) as would not prevent or materially delay the performance by such stockholder of its obligations hereunder or impose any li- ability or obligation on jpfi. each stockholder agrees that, at or prior to the effective time, it shall represent to -4- rykoff, jpfi or their respective counsel that, during the two-year period immediately following the effective time, it shall not (other than incident or pursuant to an extraordi- nary transaction) sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of (or enter into an agreement to sell, exchange or otherwise dis- pose of) shares of jpfi common stock equal to more than the lesser of (i) 25% or (ii) the shortfall percent, in each case of the shares of jpfi common stock received by it in the merger. the "shortfall percent" shall equal that percentage of the total number of shares of jpfi common stock issued in the merger as, when added to the following percentage of shares of jpfi common stock, shall equal 45%: 100% minus the sum of (i) the percent of shares of jpfi common stock issu- able in the merger to the stockholders and (ii) the percent of shares of jpfi common stock issuable in the merger to any other persons that can be identified immediately prior to the merger as holding 5% or more of the total number of shares of rykoff common stock outstanding at such time (for which pur- poses shares held by a family of mutual funds shall, to the extent possible, be identified with separate funds within such family and, to the extent so separately identifiable, treated as separate stockholders). for purposes of the re- striction on disposition of jpfi common stock pursuant to the foregoing representation, the shares of jpfi common stock held by the stockholders shall be aggregated, and the stock- holders shall be regarded as a single stockholder. notwith- standing the foregoing, no stockholder shall be required to provide the representation described herein if, as a result of a change in law (including, without limitation, a change pursuant to treasury regulations that may be applied, by election or otherwise, to the merger), the facts intended to be reached by such representation are not a necessary condi- tion for qualification of the merger under section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. for purposes of this section 7, an "extraordinary transaction" means a merger, consolidation or other business combination, tender or exchange offer, share exchange, re- structuring, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving jpfi, so long as any such transaction is not ar- ranged as part of an overall plan to which such stockholder is a party and pursuant to which the merger is also being consummated. section 8. effectiveness and termination. it is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this agreement that the merger agreement shall have been executed and deliv- ered and be in full force and effect. in the event the merg- er agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this -5- agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect. upon such termination, except for any rights any party may have in respect of any breach by any other party of its or his obligations hereunder, none of the parties hereto shall have any further obligation or liability hereunder. section 9. miscellaneous.

(c) successors and assigns. this agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be en- forceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including without limitation in the case of any cor- porate party hereto any corporate successor by merger or oth- erwise, and in the case of any individual party hereto any trustee, executor, heir, legatee or personal representative succeeding to the ownership of such party's subject shares or other securities subject to this agreement. notwithstanding any transfer of subject shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations under this agreement of the transferor.

(e) severability. if any term of this agreement or the application thereof to any party or circumstance shall be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this agreement and the application of such term to the other parties or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by ap- plicable law, provided that in such event the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (in lieu of the term or application held to be in- valid or unenforceable) that will be valid and enforceable and will carry out the parties' intentions hereunder. (f) specific performance. the parties acknowledge that money damages are not an adequate remedy for violations of this agreement and that any party may, in its sole discre- tion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this agreement or prevent any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection to the im- position of such relief. (g) remedies cumulative. all rights, powers and remedies provided under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exer- cise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the si- multaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. (h) no waiver. the failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to de- mand such compliance. (i) no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement is not intended to be for the benefit of and shall not be en- forceable by any person or entity who or which is not a party hereto. -8- (j) jurisdiction. each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of chan- cery in the state of delaware or the united states district court for the southern district of new york or any court of the state of new york located in the city of new york in any action, suit or proceeding arising in connection with this agreement, and agrees that any such action, suit or proceed- ing shall be brought only in such court (and waives any ob- jection based on forum non conveniens or any other objection to venue therein); provided, however, that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to in this paragraph (j) and shall not be deemed to be a general submis- sion to the jurisdiction of said courts or in the states of delaware or new york other than for such purposes. each party hereto hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding. (k) governing law. this agreement and all dis- putes hereunder shall be governed by and construed and en- forced in accordance with the general corporation law of the state of delaware to the fullest extent possible and other- wise by the internal laws of the state of new york without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
