relates to the common stock, $.15 per share par value ("common stock"), of magnetic technologies corporation ("issuer"), a delaware corporation with its principal executive offices at 770 linden avenue, rochester, ny 14625. item 2. identity and background. the address of the principal office and the principal business of sps technologies, inc., a pennsylvania corporation ("sps"), is 101 greenwood avenue, suite 470, jenkintown, pennsylvania 19046. sps has ten manufacturing plants in the united states and ten plants in six different countries located on five continents. sps manufactures high-strength precision mechanical fasteners and components and superalloys in ingot form and magnetic materials. during the last five years, neither sps nor, to the knowledge of sps, any executive officer or director of sps (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. the attached schedule i is a list of the directors and executive officers of sps which contains the following information with respect to each person: (a) name; (b) business address; and (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted. each person identified in schedule i hereto is a united states citizen. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to certain voting agreements dated as of august 7, 1997 between sps and certain stockholders of issuer set forth on schedule a hereto (the "voting agreement stockholders"), sps may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 744,982 shares of common stock. see response to item 5. pursuant to certain stock purchase agreements dated as of august 7, 1997 between sps and certain stockholders of issuer set forth on schedule b hereto (the "share exchange schedule 13d cusip no. 559492202 page 4 of 8 pages - --------------------------------------- ----------------------- stockholders"), sps may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 732,982 shares of common stock. see response to item 5. sps and the voting agreement stockholders entered into the voting agreements, and sps and the share exchange stockholders entered into the stock purchase agreements, in connection with the agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), dated as of august 7, 1997, by and among sps, and mtc acquisition corp., a delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of sps ("acquisition sub") and issuer. item 4. purpose of transaction. the voting agreements and the stock purchase agreements were entered into in connection with the merger agreement (the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference), pursuant to which issuer will merge with and into acquisition sub (the "merger"), with acquisition sub surviving the merger, and shares of outstanding common stock not held by dissenting shareholders or exchanged pursuant to the stock purchase agreements will be converted into the right to receive $5.00 cash. in addition to providing for the merger, the merger agreement restricts the issuer from, among other things, engaging in certain transactions, including extraordinary corporate transactions (other than the merger), making certain acquisitions, selling certain assets, changing its capitalization in certain respects, paying dividends or increasing amounts payable to its employees, officers, directors and agents, and otherwise requires the issuer to operate in the ordinary course of business. in connection with the merger, it is expected that the common stock will become eligible for termination of registration under the securities exchange act of 1934. item 5. interest in securities of issuer. as of august 7, 1997, 744,982 shares of common stock, representing 26% of the aggregate voting power of the issuer, were subject to the voting agreements. pursuant to the voting agreements, each voting agreement stockholder has agreed (1) to vote all shares of common stock over which he or she then has voting power in favor of approving the merger and adopting the merger agreement, and against any alternative transaction involving the issuer or its subsidiaries which would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the merger, including without limitation amendments to the issuer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws and (2) not to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares or take any action or omit to take any action which would prohibit, prevent or preclude the issuer from performing its obligations under the merger agreement. accordingly, by virtue of the voting agreements, sps may be deemed to have acquired shared voting power with respect to all such shares. in connection with entering into the voting agreements, on august 6, 1997, sps purchased one share of common stock for $3.50. schedule 13d cusip no. 559492202 page 5 of 8 pages - --------------------------------------- ----------------------- as of august 7, 1997, 732,982 shares of common stock, representing 25% of the aggregate voting power of the issuer, were subject to the stock purchase agreements. pursuant to the stock purchase agreements, each share exchange stockholder has agreed to transfer to sps a certain number of shares of common stock in exchange for a number of shares of common stock of sps based on a ratio of (i) the average of the daily last sales prices of such stock on the new york stock exchange for the last 20 days ending one day prior to the stockholders' meeting at which the merger agreement will be presented for adoption, to (ii) $5.00 per share. the stock purchase agreements will be consummated immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and are conditioned on the concurrent consummation of the other stock purchase agreements, the continuing effectiveness of the merger agreement, and the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the stock purchase agreements. accordingly, by virtue of the stock purchase agreements, sps may be deemed to have acquired sole dispositive power with respect to all such shares. except as described above, neither sps nor, to the knowledge of sps, any person named in schedule i beneficially owns any shares of common stock or has effected any transactions in common stock during the past 60 days.

independent legal counsel (who may be the company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel), determines in good faith that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law, the board of directors of the company, prior to september 7, 1997, may modify or withdraw its approval or recommendation of this agreement and the merger, approve or recommend a superior proposal (as defined below) or cause the company to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, but in each case only after providing at least two business days'

counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proxy statement prior to its being filed with the sec and shall give acquiror and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review all

shall (and shall cause each of the subsidiary to) furnish promptly to acquiror's representatives all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the company and the subsidiary as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations or warranties made by the company. acquiror agrees that it will not, and will cause acquiror's representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this section 6.5 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
