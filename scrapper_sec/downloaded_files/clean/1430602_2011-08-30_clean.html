consist of certain descendants of robert paine scripps who are beneficiaries of the trust, descendants of john p. scripps, and certain trusts of which descendants of john p. scripps are trustees and beneficiaries. robert paine scripps was a son of the founder of scripps. john p. scripps was a grandson of the founder and a nephew of robert paine scripps. if the trust were to have terminated as of july 31, 2011, the signatories would have held in the aggregate approximately 88% of the outstanding common voting shares as of such date. once effective, the provisions restricting transfer of common voting shares under the scripps family agreement will continue until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of robert paine scripps and john p. scripps alive when the trust

additional 10-year periods. transfer restrictions. no signatory will be able to dispose of any common voting shares (except as otherwise summarized below) without first giving other signatories and the issuer the opportunity to purchase such shares. signatories will not be able to convert common voting shares into class a common shares except for a limited period of time after giving other signatories and the issuer the aforesaid opportunity to purchase and except in certain other limited circumstances. signatories will be permitted to transfer common voting shares to their lineal descendants or trusts for the benefit of such descendants, or to any trust for the benefit of such a descendant, or to any trust for the benefit of the spouse of such descendant or any other person or entity. descendants to whom such shares are sold or transferred outright, and trustees of trusts into which such shares are transferred, must become parties to the scripps family agreement or such shares shall be deemed to be offered for sale pursuant to the scripps family agreement. signatories will also be permitted to transfer common voting shares by testamentary transfer to their spouses provided such shares are converted to class a common shares and to pledge such shares as collateral security provided that the pledgee agrees to be bound by the terms of the scripps family agreement. if title to any such shares subject to any trust is transferred to anyone other than a descendant of robert paine scripps or john p. scripps, or if a person who is a descendant of robert paine scripps or john p. scripps acquires outright any such shares held in trust but is not or does not become a party to the scripps family agreement, such shares shall be deemed to be offered for sale pursuant to the scripps family agreement. any valid transfer of common voting 6 cusip no. 811065101 shares made by signatories without compliance with the scripps family agreement will result in automatic conversion of such shares to class a common shares. voting provisions. the scripps family agreement provides that the issuer will call a meeting of the signatories prior to each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the issuer held after termination of the trust (each such meeting hereinafter referred to as a &#147;required meeting&#148;). at each required meeting, the issuer will submit for decision by the signatories, each matter, including election of directors, that the issuer will submit to its shareholders at the annual meeting or special meeting with respect to which the required meeting has been called. each signatory will be entitled, either in person or by proxy, to cast one vote for each common voting share owned of record or beneficially by him or her on each matter brought before the required meeting. each signatory will be bound by the decision reached by majority vote with respect to each matter brought before the required meeting, and at the related annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the issuer each signatory will vote his common voting shares in accordance with decisions reached at the required meeting of the signatories. john p.

shareholders of the john p. scripps newspaper group, including john p. scripps and paul k. scripps, entered into a shareholder agreement with scripps in connection with the jpsn merger. this agreement restricts to certain transferees the transfer of scripps or the issuer&#146;s common voting shares received by such shareholders pursuant to the jpsn merger. these restrictions on transfer will terminate on the earlier of the termination of the trust or completion of a public offering of common voting shares. in connection with the spin-off, scripps assigned any and all of its rights under the shareholder agreement with respect to common voting shares to the issuer. under the agreement, if a shareholder has received a written offer to purchase 25% or more of his common voting shares, the issuer has a &#147;right of first refusal&#148; to purchase such shares on the same terms as the offer. under certain other circumstances, such as bankruptcy or insolvency of a shareholder, the issuer has an option to buy all common voting shares of the issuer owned by such shareholder. under the agreement, shareholders owning 25% or more of the outstanding common voting shares issued pursuant to the jpsn merger may require the issuer to register common voting shares (subject to the right of first refusal mentioned above) under the securities act of 1933 for sale at the shareholders&#146; expense in a public offering. in addition, the former shareholders of the john p. scripps newspaper group will be entitled, subject to certain conditions, to include common voting shares (subject to the right of first refusal) that they own in any registered public offering of shares of the same class by the issuer. the registration rights expire three years from the date of a
