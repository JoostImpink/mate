(b) except to the extent otherwise permitted under section 6.04 of the merger agreement, until the expiration date, each shareholder, in the shareholder's capacity as a shareholder, will not (and will use such shareholder's reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates, officers, directors and employees and any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such shareholder, not to): (i) initiate or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan or offer to acquire all or any material part of the business or properties or capital stock of company, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, or to liquidate company or otherwise distribute to the shareholders of company all or any substantial part of the business, properties or capital stock of company (each, an "acquisition proposal"); (ii) initiate, directly or indirectly, any contact with any person in an effort to or with a view towards soliciting any acquisition proposal; (iii) furnish information concerning company's business, properties or assets to any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than parent, or any associate, agent or representative of parent) under any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to relate to an actual or potential acquisition proposal; or (iv) negotiate or enter into discussions or an agreement, directly or indirectly, with any entity or group with respect of any potential acquisition proposal. in the event any shareholder, in such shareholder's capacity as a shareholder, shall receive or become aware of any acquisition proposal subsequent to the date hereof, such shareholder shall promptly inform parent as to any such matter and the details thereof to the extent possible without breaching any other agreement to which such shareholder is a party or violating its fiduciary duties. (c) each shareholder understands and agrees that if any shareholder attempts to vote or provide any other person with the authority to vote any of the shares held by such shareholder as of the record date for any meeting at which such shares are to be voted other than in compliance with this agreement, company shall not, and such shareholder hereby unconditionally and irrevocably instructs company to not record such vote unless and until such shareholder shall have complied with the terms of this agreement. 5. no limitation on discretion as director. if any shareholder is a natural person and is a member of the board of directors of company, then this agreement will apply to the exercise by such shareholder in his or her individual capacity of rights attaching to ownership of the shares, and nothing herein shall be deemed to apply to, or to limit in any manner the discretion of such shareholder with respect to, any action which may be taken or omitted by him or her acting in his or her fiduciary capacity as a director of company. 6. additional documents. each shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of this agreement. 7. consent and waiver. each shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the transaction under the terms of any agreement to which such shareholder is a party; provided, however, that such shareholder shall not be required by this section 7 to give any consent or deliver in his or her capacity as a director or officer of company. 8. termination. this agreement and the proxy delivered in connection herewith shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the expiration date. 9. confidentiality. each shareholder agrees (i) to hold any information regarding this agreement and the transaction in strict confidence, and (ii) not to divulge any such information to any third person, except to the extent any of the same is hereafter publicly disclosed by parent. 10. miscellaneous. 10.1 severability. if any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 10.2 binding effect and assignment. this agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties without the prior written consent of the other. this agreement is intended to bind each shareholder solely as a securityholder of company only with respect to the specific matters set forth herein. 10.3 amendment and modification. this agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. 10.4 specific performance; injunctive relief. the parties hereto acknowledge that parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of each shareholder set forth herein. therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available to parent upon any such violation, parent shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to parent at law or in equity. 10.5 notices. all notices, requests, demands or other communications that are required or may be given pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered, if delivered by hand, (b) one business day after transmitted, if transmitted by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, (c) when telecopied, if telecopied (which is confirmed), or (d) three business days after mailing, if mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), to the parties at the following addresses: (a) if to any shareholder, at the address set forth below such shareholder's signature at the end hereof.
