(c) underwriter. if a demand registration is an underwritten ----------- offering, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be included in such offering shall designate the lead underwriter, who shall be acceptable to the company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and the company may designate one or more co-managing underwriters. no holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell its registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting agreements entered into in connection therewith and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such agreements. (d) penalties. if (i) the initial registration statement --------- covering all the applicable registrable securities and required to be filed by the company pursuant to this agreement is not declared effective by the commission on or before the effectiveness date or (ii) on any day after the registration statement has been declared effective by the commission sales of all the registrable securities required to be included on a registration statement cannot be made pursuant to the registration statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep the registration statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to the initial registration statement, or to register sufficient shares of common stock, but excluding any periods when such sales cannot be made solely by reason of any act or omission attributable to the purchasers), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the registrable securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity), the company shall pay to each holder an amount in cash (a "registration delay ------------------- 5 page 60 of 91 pages payment") equal to the difference between (a) the product of (1) the number - ------- shares of registrable securities such holder attempts to sell and (2) the per share market value on the last trading date immediately prior to such sale, and (b) the purchase price received by the holder in a bona fide transaction wherein it has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest price possible with respect to the sale of such shares of common stock; provided, however, that -------- ------- nothing contained herein shall require the holders to effect a demand registration. notwithstanding the foregoing, if sales cannot be made pursuant to a registration statement for reasons other than the company's negligence or failure to act, prior to the imposition of any registration delay payment the company shall have five (5) business days (beginning on the first day when sales cannot be made pursuant to such registration statement) to cure such condition so that sales of all registrable securities required to be included on a registration statement can be made pursuant to such registration statement. 3. registration procedures ----------------------- in connection with the company's registration obligations hereunder, the company shall: (a) preparation of registration statement. prepare and file -------------------------------------- with the commission on or prior to the filing date a registration statement on form f-3 or its successor form (or if the company is not then eligible to register for resale the registrable securities on form f-3 such registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith (which shall include a plan of distribution substantially in the form of exhibit a annexed hereto, --------- unless in connection with an underwritten offering) or, in connection with an underwritten offering hereunder, such other form agreed to by the company and a majority of the registrable securities to be covered by such registration statement), and cause the registration statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that not less than three (3) -------- ------- business days prior to the filing of the registration statement or any related prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that would be incorporated therein by reference), the company shall, if reasonably practicable (i) furnish to the holders and any managing underwriter copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (including documents incorporated by reference), which documents will be subject to the review of such holders and any managing underwriter, and (ii) cause its officers and directors, counsel and independent certified public accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of respective counsel to such holders and such underwriters, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the securities act. the company shall not file the registration statement or any such prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the lead investor or any managing underwriter shall reasonably object, and will not request acceleration of such registration statement without prior notice to such counsel. the sections of such registration statement covering information with respect to the holders, the holder's beneficial ownership of securities of the company or the holders intended method of disposition of registrable securities shall conform to the information provided to the company by each of the holders.

omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon and in conformity with information regarding such holder furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use therein, which information was reasonably relied on by the company for use therein or to the extent that such information relates to such holder or such holder's proposed method of distribution of registrable securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such holder

the sale of the registrable securities in any case where such delivery is required by the securities act and the untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission of material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), unless the failure to deliver such final prospectus (as amended

(b) indemnification by holders. each holder shall, severally -------------------------- and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the company, the directors, officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the company (within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act and section 20 of the exchange act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all losses, as incurred, arising solely out of or based solely upon any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement, any prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or arising solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such holder to the company specifically for inclusion in the registration statement or such prospectus and that such information was reasonably relied upon by the company for use in the registration statement, such prospectus or such form of prospectus or to the extent that such information relates to such holder or such holder's proposed method of distribution of registrable securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such holder expressly for use in the registration statement, such prospectus or such form of prospectus; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 5(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any losses if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such holder. in no event shall the liability of any selling holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds 13 page 68 of 91 pages received by such holder upon the sale of the registrable securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. if any proceeding --------------------------------------- shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "indemnified party"), such indemnified party promptly shall notify the ------------------ person from whom indemnity is sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and ------------------- the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice - -------- ------- shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the indemnifying party. an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless: (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in any such proceeding, or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party). the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. all fees and expenses of the indemnified party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this section) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within ten (10) business days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party, which notice shall be delivered no more frequently than on a monthly basis (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the indemnifying party may require such indemnified party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). 14 page 69 of 91 pages (d) contribution. if a claim for indemnification under section ------------ 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party because of a failure or refusal of a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in section 5(c), any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred

exhibit a of the securities purchase agreement page 79 of 91 pages exhibit a plan of distribution our company is registering the shares of common stock on behalf of the selling stockholders. all costs, expenses and fees in connection with the registration of the shares offered by this prospectus will be borne by the company, other than brokerage commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares which will be borne by the selling stockholders. sales of shares may be effected by selling stockholders from time to time in one or more types of transactions (which may include block transactions) on the smallcap market system of the nasdaq stock market, in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through put or call options transactions relating to the shares, through short sales of shares, or a combination of such methods of sale, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. such transactions may or may not involve brokers or dealers. the selling stockholders have advised our company that they have not entered into any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of their securities, nor is there an underwriter or coordinated broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of shares by the selling stockholders. the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions. in connection with such transactions, broker-dealers or other financial institutions may engage in short sales of the shares or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for the shares in the course of hedging positions they assume with selling stockholders. the selling stockholders may also enter into options or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions which require the delivery to such broker-dealers or other financial institutions of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as amended or supplemented to reflect such transaction). the selling stockholders may make these transactions by selling shares directly to purchasers or to or through broker-dealers, which may act as agents or principals. such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions). the selling stockholders and any broker-dealers that act in connection with the sale of shares are "underwriters" within the meaning of section 2(11) of the securities act, and any commissions received by such broker-dealers or any profit on the resale of the shares sold by them while acting as principals might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the securities act. the selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the securities act. page 80 of 91 pages because selling stockholders are "underwriters" within the meaning of section 2(11) of the securities act, the selling stockholders will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act. our company has informed the selling stockholders that the anti-manipulative provisions of regulation m promulgated under the exchange act may apply to their sales in the market. selling stockholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in open market transactions in reliance upon rule 144 under the securities act, provided they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of rule 144. upon our company being notified by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to rule 424(b) under the securities act, disclosing: o the name of each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s); o the number of shares involved; o the initial price at which such shares were sold; o the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable; o that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus; and o other facts material to the transactions. page 81 of 91 pages exhibit b form of notice of effectiveness of registration statement [transfer agent] attn.: re: nexus telocation systems ltd. ladies
