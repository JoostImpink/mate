(c) wireless may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of such securities pursuant to a tender offer, merger, sale of all or substantially all the issuer's assets or any similar transaction that offers each holder of common stock (other than, if applicable, the person proposing such transaction and its affiliates) the opportunity to dispose of common stock for the same consideration or otherwise contemplates the acquisition of common stock beneficially owned by each such holder for the same consideration.

(ii) the issuance of certificates for shares of common stock upon conversion shall be made without charge for any issue, stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance. however, if any such certificate is to be issued in a name other than that of the holder of record of the shares converted, the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall pay to the corporation the amount of any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in such issuance or shall establish to the satisfaction of the corporation that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (iii) upon any conversion of shares of series d preferred stock in accordance with the provisions of this certificate of designation, the corporation shall pay to the holder thereof, simultaneously with the issuance of the shares of common stock into which such shares of series d preferred stock have been converted, the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of series d preferred stock the record date for payment of which is prior to the date of issuance of such shares of common stock. (e) reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series d preferred stock, the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable if all then outstanding shares of series d preferred stock were converted. if at any time the number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the shares of series d preferred stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the series d preferred stock, the corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose, including, without limitation, taking appropriate board action, recommending such an increase to the holders of common stock, holding stockholders meetings, soliciting votes and proxies in favor of such increase to obtain the requisite stockholder approval and upon such approval, the corporation shall reserve and keep available such additional shares solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the series d preferred stock. (f) notices. any notice required by the provisions of this certificate of designation to be given to the holders of shares of series d preferred stock shall be deemed given five (5) days after such notice is deposited in the united states mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at its address appearing on the books of the corporation, or the next business day after such notice is delivered to a recognized overnight courier service with next-business day delivery specified. (g) reorganization, merger or sale of the corporation. notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in case of (a) any reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation or (b) any merger or consolidation of the corporation, that in any such case results in the common stock being converted into other securities or property, or the right to receive other securities and property, then, to the extent the corporation or the holders do not otherwise convert all outstanding shares of series d preferred stock, each share of series d preferred stock that is not converted into the right to receive other securities or property prior to such transaction shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of common stock, the kind and amount of securities and property receivable upon consummation of such transaction by a holder of that number of shares of common stock into which one share of series d preferred stock was convertible immediately prior to such transaction. (h) adjustments. the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of the series d preferred stock that are then outstanding shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (i) stock dividends; stock splits; reverse stock splits. in case the corporation shall (a) declare or pay a dividend on its outstanding common stock in shares of common stock or make a distribution to all holders of its outstanding common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares or reclassify its outstanding common stock, or (c) combine its outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each share of series d preferred stock shall be adjusted so that the holder of each such share shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion thereof the kind and number of shares of common stock or other securities that such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such share been converted in full immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto (with any record date requirement being deemed to have been satisfied), and, in any such case, the number of shares of common stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of each such share shall be subject to further adjustments under this section 5(h). an adjustment made pursuant to this section 5(h)(i) shall become effective at the record date, if any, for such event. (ii) distributions to stockholders. in case the corporation shall issue to holders of its common stock rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities (collectively, the "rights") entitling them to subscribe for or purchase common stock at a price per share of common stock (determined by dividing (a) the total amount receivable by the corporation in consideration of the issuance of such rights plus the total consideration payable to the corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total number of shares of common stock covered by such rights) that is lower than the current market price per share of common stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance, then the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of series d preferred stock shall be increased in a manner determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock theretofore issuable upon the conversion of all shares of series d preferred stock by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such rights plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such rights plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration to be received by the corporation in connection with such issuance (as defined in the following sentence) would purchase at the then current market price per share of common stock. for purposes of this section 5(h), the "current market price" per share of common stock for any date shall mean average of the closing prices of the common stock for the 10 trading days prior to such date. for purposes of this section 5(h)(ii), the "aggregate consideration to be received by the corporation" in connection with any issuance of such rights shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the corporation for such rights plus any consideration or premiums stated in such rights to be paid for the shares of common stock covered thereby. (iii) issuance of common stock at lower values in case the corporation shall, in a transaction to which section 5(h)(i) is inapplicable (and, in any event, other than upon conversion of series a preferred stock or series d preferred stock, or upon exercise of any warrants or employee stock options that were outstanding on the date of issuance of the series d preferred stock or pursuant to contractual commitments to which the corporation was bound on such date), issue or sell shares of common stock, or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, at a price per share of common stock (determined, in the case of rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, by dividing (a) the total amount receivable by the corporation in consideration of the issuance and sale of such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, plus the total consideration payable to the corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total number of shares of common stock covered by such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities) that is lower (at the date of such sale or issuance) than the current market price per share of common stock in effect immediately prior to such sale or issuance or for no consideration, then in each case the number of shares of common stock thereafter issuable upon the conversion of the shares of series d preferred stock shall be increased in a manner determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock theretofore issuable upon the conversion of all shares of series d preferred stock by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the sale or issuance, plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase or to be issued upon conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the sale or issuance plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration to be received by the corporation (as defined in the following paragraph) in connection with such sale or issuance would purchase at the then current market price per share of common stock. for the purpose of such adjustments the "aggregate consideration to be received by the corporation" therefore shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the corporation for such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities plus any consideration or premiums stated in such rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities to be paid for the shares of common stock covered thereby. in case the corporation shall issue or sell shares of common stock or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock for a consideration consisting, in whole or in part, of property other than cash or its equivalent, then in determining the "price per share of common stock" and the "consideration" receivable by or payable to the corporation for purposes of sections 5(h)(ii) and 5(h)(iii), the board of directors of the corporation shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of such property. in case the corporation shall issue and sell rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, together with one or more other securities as part of a unit at a price per unit, then in determining the "price per share of common stock" and the "consideration" receivable by or payable to the corporation for purposes of sections 5(h)(ii) and 5(h)(iii), the board of directors of the corporation shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of the rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities then being sold as part of such unit. any increase of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of series d preferred stock pursuant to this section 5(h)(iii) shall be allocated among such series d preferred stock on a pro rata basis. (iv) expiration of rights, options and conversio privileges. upon the expiration of any rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights that have previously resulted in an adjustment under this section 5(h), if any thereof shall not have been exercised, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of series d preferred stock shall be readjusted and shall thereafter, upon any future exercise, be such as they would have been had they been originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if (i) the only shares of common stock so issued were the shares of common stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights and (ii) such shares of common stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the corporation upon such exercise plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the corporation for issuance, sale or grant of all such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights whether or not exercised; provided that no such readjustment shall have the effect of decreasing the number of shares issuable upon conversion of series d preferred stock by a number that is in excess of the amount or number of the adjustment initially made in respect of the issuance, sale or grant of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights or shall have the effect of decreasing the number of shares of common stock that have been issued upon conversion of any shares of series d stock prior to the date of such readjustment. (v) de minimis adjustments. no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable under any series d preferred stock shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon a conversion of series d preferred stock; provided, that any adjustments which by reason of this section 5(h) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations shall be made to the nearest one-thousandth of a share. (vi) notice of adjustment. whenever the number of shares of common stock or other stock or property issuable upon the conversion of series d preferred stock is adjusted, as herein provided, the corporation shall deliver to the holders thereof a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants selected by the board of directors of the corporation (who may be the regular accountants employed by the corporation) setting forth the number of shares of common stock or other stock or property issuable upon the conversion of each share of series d preferred stock after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made and shall promptly mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments. (i) status of converted shares. upon conversion, any shares of the series d preferred stock that have been so converted shall be retired and thereafter have the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular series by the board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof. 6. preemptive rights. no shares of series d preferred stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities or such warrants, rights or options may be designated, issued or granted. exhibit b registration rights agreement amended and restated registration rights agreement this amended and restated registration rights agreement (this "agreement") is entered into as of ________, 2000, by and among metrocall, inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"), at&t wireless services, inc., a delaware corporation ("wireless"), and mccaw communications companies, inc., a delaware corporation ("mccaw"). recitals whereas, wireless is the record and beneficial owner of 10,378 shares of the company' series c convertible preferred stock, a portion of which it received as assignee of mccaw;

such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, or (b) such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there is an actual or potential conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the indemnifying party to represent such indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that indemnified party elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one cause of action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out

proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action or proceedings, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. the failure of any indemnified party to give prompt notice of a claim for indemnification hereunder shall not limit the indemnifying party's obligations to indemnify under this agreement, except to the extent such failure is prejudicial to the ability of the indemnifying party to defend the action. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that be made against any indemnified party, (y) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party and (z) such judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. 5.04 contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article v is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgment referred to herein, then such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments in the following manner: as between the company on the one hand and any indemnified party entitled to indemnification under section 5.01 on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company on the one hand and any indemnified party entitled to indemnification under section 5.01 on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of any indemnified party entitled to indemnification under section 5.01 on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the means of subsection 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation 5.05 survival. the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this article v shall remain

the company covenants that following the registration of shares it will timely file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act so as to enable each holder
