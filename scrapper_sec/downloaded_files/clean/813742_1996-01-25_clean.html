jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future page 6 of 21 pages violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on january 15, 1996, dowelanco entered into an exchange and purchase agreement (the "exchange and purchase agreement") among mycogen, agrigenetics, inc., a delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of mycogen ("agrigenetics") and united agriseeds, inc., a delaware corporation and wholly- owned subsidiary of dowelanco ("uas"). pursuant to the exchange and purchase agreement dowelanco has agreed to acquire (a) 2,707,884 shares of common stock and a $100,000 promissory note of agrigenetics (the "promissory note") in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of uas and (b) 1,745,450 shares of common stock in exchange for $26,400,000. the consideration under the exchange and purchase agreement is subject to adjustment based on the tangible net worth of uas as of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement (the "mycogen closing"). pursuant to the exchange and purchase agreement, mycogen, agrigenetics and dowelanco have agreed to execute and deliver at the mycogen closing an agreement (the "technology agreement") providing for the exchange between the parties of certain currently existing genes and tools and certain new genes and tools developed or acquired during the five year period following the mycogen closing. the obligations of each party to effect the mycogen closing are subject to certain conditions as more fully set forth below. also on january 15, 1996, dowelanco entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "stock purchase agreement") among the lubrizol corporation, an ohio corporation ("lubrizol") and agc holdings, inc., a delaware corporation and a second-tier wholly-owned subsidiary of lubrizol ("agc"). pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dowelanco has agreed to acquire 9,502,348 shares of common stock from agc and lubrizol in exchange for approximately $126,217,849. in addition, if the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement (the "lubrizol closing") occurs on or after february 29, 1996, dowelanco will pay interest, for each day beginning on february 29, 1996 through and including the lubrizol closing, on the amount of $124,938,000 at a rate equal to the six-month london interbank offered rate ("libor") in effect from time to time divided by 365 from february 29, 1996 until the lubrizol closing. in addition, in the event any additional options to purchase shares of common stock vest prior to the lubrizol closing, lubrizol has agreed to exercise, or cause the exercise of such options and to sell the resulting shares of common stock to dowelanco in exchange for the difference between $13.00 and the average option exercise price for such options. the obligations of each party to effect the lubrizol closing are subject to certain conditions as more fully set forth below. dowelanco expects to obtain the funds required to effect the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement and the stock purchase agreement from working capital and other internal sources. item 4. purpose of transaction. the purpose of the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement for dowelanco is to acquire approximately 4.45 million shares of common stock from mycogen, to cause uas to become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of mycogen and, pursuant to the technology agreement, to acquire access to certain technology of mycogen. page 7 of 21 pages the purpose of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement for dowelanco is to acquire approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock from lubrizol. if the mycogen closing occurs and the lubrizol closing also occurs, dowelanco will own approximately 45.86% of the outstanding common stock and will be entitled to designate the number of mycogen directors equal to the nearest whole number that is less than one-half of the total number of mycogen directors. dowelanco's ability to acquire more common stock or to designate additional mycogen directors is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the exchange and purchase agreement, as described more fully below. however, the exchange and purchase agreement, after the mycogen closing, would not prohibit dowelanco from acquiring a majority of the common stock, at which time it would have the right to designate a majority of mycogen's directors. it is likely that dowelanco will attempt to acquire a majority of the common stock and designate a majority of mycogen's directors if the mycogen closing occurs and the lubrizol closing also occurs, although dowelanco has not made a final decision on this matter. dowelanco has agreed that, unless another person or group has made a proposal to acquire 25% or more of the common stock, (a) for a period of two years from the earlier to occur of the mycogen closing or, under certain circumstances, the termination of the exchange and purchase agreement (the "measurement date") dowelanco will not acquire more than 60% of the outstanding common stock and (b) from the second anniversary of the measurement date to the third anniversary of the measurement date, dowelanco will not acquire more than 65% of the outstanding common stock, (in the case of both (a) and (b), excluding shares of common stock, if any, purchased directly from mycogen or its employees after the measurement date). in any event, dowelanco has agreed not to acquire from any person more than 79.9% of the total outstanding shares of common stock for three years after the measurement date and after that time only pursuant to a "buyout transaction" as described below. following the third anniversary of the measurement date, dowelanco may increase its beneficial ownership of common stock above 79.9% of the total outstanding shares only pursuant to a tender offer, merger or similar transaction (but not a sale of assets) for all of the outstanding shares of common stock that offers each holder of common stock other than dowelanco the opportunity to dispose of some or all of their common stock at the value that an unaffiliated third party would be expected to pay in an arms'-length transaction negotiated by a willing seller and a willing buyer for all of mycogen's then outstanding shares of common stock and not taking into account the potentially controlling position of dowelanco (a "buyout transaction"). a buyout transaction may only be effected if approved by a majority of mycogen's independent directors or if the value to be offered to holders of common stock is determined through arbitration by an independent appraiser. following the mycogen closing, mycogen has agreed to establish, upon dowelanco's request, a voluntary procedure by which dowelanco will be permitted to purchase shares of page 8 of 21 pages common stock from participating employees of mycogen upon the exercise of employee stock options by such participating employees. dowelanco will have no obligation to purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to such procedures. the board of directors of mycogen is currently comprised of six members. for a period of three years following the measurement date, (a) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of less than 20% of the outstanding common stock, dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination one person to serve on the board of directors of mycogen, (b) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of 20% or more but less than 30% of the outstanding common stock, dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination two directors of mycogen, (c) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of 30% or more but less than 50% of the outstanding common stock, mycogen will cause its board of directors to consist of seven members and dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination three (or, if the number of directors is other than seven, the nearest whole number less than one-half times the total number of directors) directors of mycogen and (d) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the outstanding common stock, mycogen will cause its board of directors to consist of nine directors and dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination five (or, if the number of directors is other than nine, the nearest whole number greater than one-half times the total number of directors) directors of mycogen. under the stock purchase agreement, lubrizol and agc have agreed to obtain the resignations of the directors nominated by lubrizol and agc to serve on the board of directors of mycogen as a condition to dowelanco's obligations to effect the lubrizol closing. in accordance with the rights of dowelanco set forth above, it is expected that persons designated for nomination by dowelanco will be nominated to fill the vacancies created by such resignations. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) if the mycogen closing occurs and the lubrizol closing also occurs, dowelanco will own an aggregate of 13,955,682 shares of common stock which will, upon issuance by mycogen of 4,453,334 of such shares of common stock at the mycogen closing, represent approximately 45.86% of the then total outstanding shares of common stock (based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at january 12, 1996 and assuming the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement and the stock purchase agreement). (b) lubrizol and agc have granted dowelanco an irrevocable proxy to vote 9,487,349 currently outstanding shares of common stock and 14,999 shares of common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of options. in addition to such irrevocable proxy, lubrizol and agc have agreed, if that proxy is for any reason invalid, to vote any shares of common stock held by them against certain matters which would conflict with or impede the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement or the stock purchase agreement and in favor of any action or agreement that would further the page 9 of 21 pages consummation of the transactions contemplated by the exchange and purchase agreement or the stock purchase agreement. (c) none of tdcc, rofan, dowelanco or their respective affiliates have effected any transactions in the common stock in the past sixty days except, in the case of dowelanco, for the execution on january 15, 1996 of the exchange and purchase agreement and the stock purchase agreement. (d) none of tdcc, rofan, dowelanco or their respective affiliates is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangement, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the following summaries of certain terms of the exchange and purchase

(ii) post-closing restrictions on stock acquisitions. dowelanco has agreed that, unless another person or group has made a proposal to acquire 25% or more of the common stock, (a) for a period of two years from the measurement date, dowelanco will not acquire more than 60% of the outstanding common stock and (b) from the second anniversary of the measurement date to the third anniversary of the measurement date, dowelanco will not acquire more than 65% of the outstanding common stock, (in the case of both (a) and (b), excluding shares of common stock, if any, purchased directly from mycogen or its employees after the mycogen closing). in any event, dowelanco has agreed not to acquire from any person more than 79.9% of the total outstanding shares of common stock for three years after the measurement date and after that time only pursuant to a buyout transaction as described below. (iii) buyout transaction. following the third anniversary of the measurement date, dowelanco may increase its beneficial ownership of common stock above 79.9% of the total outstanding shares only pursuant to a buyout transaction. a buyout transaction may only be effected if approved by a majority of mycogen's independent directors or if the value to be offered to holders of common stock is determined through arbitration by an independent appraiser. (iv) employee stock options. following the mycogen closing, mycogen has agreed to establish, upon dowelanco's request, a voluntary procedure by which dowelanco will be permitted to purchase shares of common stock from participating employees of mycogen upon the exercise of employee stock options by such participating employees. dowelanco will have no obligation to purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to such procedures. (d) election of directors. the board of directors of mycogen currently is comprised of six members. for a period of three years following the measurement date, (a) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of less than 20% of the outstanding common stock, mycogen will cause its board of directors to consist of seven members and dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination one person to serve on the board of directors of mycogen, (b) at any time dowelanco is page 15 of 21 pages the beneficial owner of 20% or more but less than 30% of the outstanding common stock, dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination two directors of mycogen, (c) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner of 30% or more but less than 50% of the outstanding common stock, mycogen will cause its board of directors to consist of seven members and dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination three (or, if the number of directors is other than seven, the nearest whole number less than one-half times the total number of directors) directors of mycogen and (d) at any time dowelanco is the beneficial owner or more than 50% of the outstanding common stock, mycogen will cause its board of directors to consist of nine directors and dowelanco will be entitled to designate for nomination five (or, if the number of directors is other than nine, the nearest whole number greater than one-half times the total number of directors) directors of mycogen. (e) issuance of common stock and right of first refusal.

(ii) following the second anniversary of the measurement date, mycogen may issue new securities for cash, other than (i) any securities issuable upon conversion of any convertible security of mycogen outstanding as of january 15, 1996, (ii) any securities issuable upon exercise of any option, warrant or other similar security of mycogen authorized as of january 15, 1996, and (iii) any securities issuable to mycogen stockholders on a proportional basis in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization of mycogen; provided, that mycogen affords dowelanco a right of first refusal to purchase all of the new securities proposed to be issued (other than any new securities issued to officers, directors and employees pursuant to certain existing benefit plans or any newly created employee benefit plan or to dowelanco and its affiliates) at market value (based on the average daily closing price for the trading days within the 90 calendar days preceding the date of the proposed sale). (f) rights agreement. unless the exchange and purchase agreement and the stock purchase agreement both have been terminated according to their terms without the purchase of any shares of common stock by dowelanco or an affiliate, successor or assign of dowelanco, mycogen (i) will ensure that the rights agreement page 16 of 21 pages and the rights thereunder will not prevent dowelanco or an affiliate from acquiring or proposing to acquire some or all of the outstanding shares of common stock and (ii) will not amend, interpret or enforce the rights agreement or adopt any new shareholder rights agreement if such action would have an adverse effect on dowelanco or on the ability of dowelanco or an affiliate to acquire or propose to acquire some or all of the outstanding shares of common stock.

(h) federal income tax considerations. the parties have agreed that the sale of all the shares of common stock of uas in exchange for 2,707,884 shares of common stock and the promissory note is intended to constitute a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code").

directly or indirectly, acquire or propose to acquire any shares of common stock other than pursuant to this agreement or the stock purchase agreement or any amendments hereto or thereto, unless, on or after the date of this agreement, (a) any person or group of persons other than (1) any person specified in rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii) under the exchange act or (2) any person who does not own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the date of this agreement, acquires beneficial ownership of shares of common stock representing 10% or more of the then total outstanding shares of common stock, (b) any beneficial owner, other than any person specified in rule 13d- 1(b)(1)(i) and (ii) under the exchange act, of the company who beneficially owned 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the date of this agreement acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock representing 2% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) any person or group of persons other than parent or any of its affiliates commences or makes a public announcement of an intention to commence a tender offer to acquire 10% or more of the then total outstanding shares of common stock, (d) any person or group of persons other than parent or any of its affiliates makes an acquisition proposal relating to shares of common stock representing 40% or more of the then outstanding shares of common stock, which acquisition proposal is not conditioned on obtaining financing or financing commitments, or (e) the company enters into an agreement with any 40 person pursuant to the proviso in section 6.8.1 or this agreement has been terminated. section 6.10 rights agreement. unless this agreement and the stock purchase agreement have both been terminated according to their terms without parent or an affiliate, successor or assign of parent having purchased any shares of common stock under either this agreement or the stock purchase agreement (collectively, "double termination"), the company, from and after the date of this agreement (i) will take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights agreement and the rights thereunder will not prevent parent or an affiliate of parent from acquiring or proposing to acquire some or all of the outstanding shares of common stock and (ii) will not amend, interpret or enforce the rights agreement or adopt any new shareholder rights agreement or other similar agreement, plan or measure, if such amendment, interpretation, enforcement or adoption would have an adverse effect on parent or on the ability of parent or an affiliate to acquire or propose to acquire some or all of the outstanding shares of common stock. if a double termination occurs the action described in section 4.5 may be revoked. section 6.11 post-closing covenants of the company. 6.11.1 subject to section 6.12, so long as parent has the right to nominate at least two members to the board, the company will not, without the prior written approval of parent, issue any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents except: (i) shares of common stock authorized and reserved as of the date hereof for issuance pursuant to any company plan, (ii) not more than an aggregate of 2,000,000 new common stock equivalents issued to directors, officers or employees pursuant to any employee benefit plans approved by the company during the 3 year period after the measurement date and (iii) not more than an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the assets or securities of one or more other persons. in the event that the company at any time after the date of this agreement declares or pays a dividend on any company security payable in shares of common stock, subdivides or splits the outstanding common stock, combines or consolidates the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, effects a reverse split of the outstanding shares, or issues any shares of common stock in an exchange, reclassification, consolidation or merger, the 2,000,000 share limitations in (ii) and (iii) above will be proportionately adjusted accordingly. whenever the company proposes to issue any shares of common stock pursuant to this section 6.11.1, the company will offer parent the right, exercisable within 60 days of such offer, to purchase at market value such number of additional shares of common stock from the company as will prevent the total percentage interest of parent from being reduced as a result of the proposed issuance of common 41 stock. for purposes of this section 6.11, "total percentage interest of parent" means the percentage of shares of common stock beneficially owned by parent and its affiliates, determined on the basis of the total number of shares of common stock actually outstanding. 6.11.2 subject to section 6.12, but notwithstanding the limitations in section 6.11.1, following the second anniversary of the measurement date, the company may issue new securities for cash provided that the company will have first afforded parent a right of first refusal to purchase all of the new securities proposed to be issued for cash in accordance with this section 6.11.2 (other than any new securities issued to (i) officers, directors or employees or the company and any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any company plan or newly created employee benefit plan, and (ii) parent or any of its affiliates). if the company proposes to issue any new securities for cash at any time following the second anniversary of the measurement date, the company will deliver to parent a written notice stating the number and kind of new securities proposed to be issued, the identities of the persons to whom the new securities are proposed to be issued, the proposed cash issue price of the new securities and the other terms and conditions upon which the new securities are proposed to be issued (a "right of first refusal notice"). for a period of 20 business days following the date of parent's receipt of a right of first refusal notice, parent will have the right to purchase the new securities described in the right of first refusal notice in whole or in part at a cash price equal to the market value (the "right of first refusal") by so notifying the company in writing. if parent has not notified the company in writing of its intention to exercise such right of first refusal by the close of business on the 20th business day following parent's receipt of the right of first refusal notice, the company may issue such new securities for cash in the manner stated in the right of first refusal notice, or, if parent has notified the company in writing of its intention to exercise such right of first refusal only in part, the company may thereafter issue for cash the portion of the new securities not being purchased by parent or its affiliates in the manner stated in the right of first refusal notice. if, subsequent to the date of any right of first refusal notice, the company proposes to issue the new securities described in the right of first refusal notice at a different price or on terms and conditions otherwise materially different from those described in the right of first refusal notice, the company will deliver to parent a new right of first refusal notice describing such terms and conditions and repeat the foregoing procedures. the company and parent understand and acknowledge that the foregoing right of first refusal is not intended to enforce a common law preemptive right and is entered into as a matter of contract at arms'-length. if the right of first refusal is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole 42 or in part, by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the company will, for a period of 30 days following the date of such final judgment, offer parent the right to purchase at market value such number of additional shares of common stock from the company as will prevent the total percentage interest of parent represented by the common stock then beneficially owned by parent from being reduced as a result of the proposed issuance of new securities. 6.11.3 so long as parent has the right to nominate at least two members to the board, the company will not, without the prior written approval of parent, merge, consolidate, exchange, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of (i) the company's plant science business (the "seed business") or (ii) the company's crop protection business (the "crop business"). 6.11.4 so long as parent has the right to nominate at least two members to the board, the company will not, without the prior written approval of parent, purchase, invest, lease or otherwise acquire securities or assets which are not related to and for use in the seed business or the crop business. 6.11.5 after the closing, the company and agrigenetics will use their reasonable best efforts to cause subsidiary to perform and comply with all of its material contractual obligations existing as of the closing, including such obligations assigned by parent to subsidiary, where the failure of subsidiary to so perform and comply would result in actual damages or losses to parent. 6.11.6 after the closing, upon parent's request, the company will establish a voluntary process by which parent will be permitted to purchase shares of common stock from participating employees of the company upon the exercise of employee stock options by such participating employees; provided, however, that parent shall have no obligation to purchase any such shares of common stock. section 6.12 post-closing restrictions on stock acquisitions. 6.12.1 (a) for a period of 2 years from the measurement date, neither parent nor any of its affiliates will acquire or propose to acquire shares of common stock from third parties which, when aggregated with all shares of common stock beneficially owned by parent and its affiliates other than any shares of common stock which were acquired by parent or any of its affiliates after the measurement date directly from the company or any of its subsidiaries or employees, would constitute in excess of 60% of the then total outstanding shares of common stock and (b) from the second anniversary of the measurement date 43 through the third anniversary of the measurement date, neither parent nor any of its affiliates will acquire or propose to acquire shares of common stock from third parties which, when aggregated with all shares of common stock owned by parent and its affiliates other than any shares of common stock which were acquired by parent or any of its affiliates after the measurement date directly from the company or any of its subsidiaries or employees, would constitute in excess of 65% of the then total outstanding shares of common stock; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions will not apply if a person or group other than parent or its affiliates has made an acquisition proposal in which it proposes to acquire 25% or more of the company's then outstanding shares of common stock or common stock equivalents. 6.12.2 except as provided in section 6.13, at any time after the measurement date, neither parent nor any of its affiliates may acquire or propose to acquire shares of common stock from persons, including the company, which, when aggregated with all shares of common stock then beneficially owned by parent and its affiliates, would constitute more than 79.9% of the then total outstanding shares of common stock (taking into account in the calculation of total outstanding shares of common stock any shares of common stock that the company issued or proposes to issue to parent or any of its affiliates after the measurement date). section 6.13 buyout transaction. following the third anniversary of the measurement date, parent may increase its beneficial ownership of common stock above 79.9% of the total outstanding shares of common stock only pursuant to a buyout transaction complying with the following procedures: 6.13.1 if parent is able to obtain the approval of a majority of the company's independent directors for a proposed buyout transaction after they have received an opinion, satisfactory to them, from an internationally recognized investment bank selected by the independent directors on the aggregate third party sale value with respect to such buyout transaction, parent may proceed with such buyout transaction (in which event nothing in this agreement will prevent or impede such buyout transaction from proceeding or being consummated and the company will take all action reasonably necessary to allow such transaction to proceed in accordance with the provisions hereof). 6.13.2 if pursuant to section 6.13.1 parent is not able to obtain the approval of a majority of the independent directors for a proposed buyout transaction within 60 days after such buyout transaction is first proposed to the directors of the company, parent may either (a) withdraw such proposal or (b) request arbitration of the amount of the third party sale value. parent and the company will appoint an independent appraiser 44 (which will be an internationally recognized investment bank) mutually satisfactory to them that will determine the aggregate third party sale value with respect to the proposed buyout transaction. if parent and the company are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable appraiser within such 15-day period, the third party sale value will be determined by an independent appraiser (which will be an internationally recognized investment bank) chosen by two other independent appraisers (which will be internationally recognized investment banks), one of whom will be appointed by parent and the other of whom will be appointed by the company or, if such two appraisers are unable to agree on a third appraiser within seven days after the appointment of the second of them, by the american arbitration association (or its successor); provided, however, that if parent or the company will not have appointed its appraiser within 30 days after a request by parent for determination of the amount of the third party sale value, such determination will be made solely by the appraiser selected by the other party. parent and the company may each submit to the appraiser their respective positions on the third party sale value and may also submit written and oral presentations to support their respective positions. the appraiser will determine the aggregate amount of the third party sale value. the appraiser will be directed to make its determination within 30 calendar days of appointment and such determination, when made, will be final and binding with respect to the proposed buyout transaction. 6.13.3 within 10 business days after the appropriate third party sale value is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth above, parent will elect: (a) to proceed with a buyout transaction offering the third party sale value consideration payable in cash and/or marketable securities (in which event nothing in this agreement will prevent or impede such buyout transaction from proceeding or being consummated and the company will take all action reasonably necessary to allow such transaction to proceed in accordance with the provisions hereof, including obtaining the vote of the directors on the board in favor of such buyout transaction so as to obtain the requisite board approval therefor); or (b) to withdraw its proposal for a buyout transaction (in which event parent may not again propose a buyout transaction for a period of one year after such withdrawal, unless it is invited to do so by the company's independent directors). 6.13.4 the fees and expenses of the appraiser will be divided equally between parent and the company. section 6.14 election of directors. 45 6.14.1 for a period of three years from and after the measurement date, parent and the company will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the following to occur: (i) at any time that parent and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of less than 20% of the then outstanding common stock, parent will have the right to designate for nomination one director to the board; (ii) at any time that parent and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of less than 30% but in any event not less than 20% of the then outstanding common stock, parent will have the right to designate for nomination two directors to the board; (iii) at any time that parent and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of less than 50% but in any event not less than 30% of the then outstanding common stock, the company will cause the board to consist of seven directors with three of such directors to be designees of parent, or, if the board will for any reason consist of a number of directors other than seven, with such number of directors equal to the nearest whole number less than one- half times the total number of directors to be designees of parent; and (iv) at any time that parent and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of more than 50% of the then outstanding common stock, the company will cause the board to consist of nine directors with five of such directors to be designees of parent, or, if the board will for any reason consist of a number

(including interest, penalties, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys) (collectively, the "losses") (which, for the purposes of this section 9.2, will also include the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys incurred by a parent indemnified party in bringing a claim under this agreement, prosecuting its rights of indemnity in respect of such claim and collecting any amounts awarded upon such claim) suffered, sustained or incurred or required to be paid by any such parent indemnified party due to, based upon, arising out of or otherwise with respect to (i) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of the company or agrigenetics contained in this agreement, (ii) any brokerage fees, commissions or

claim under this agreement, prosecuting its rights of indemnity in respect of such claim and collecting any amounts awarded upon such claim) suffered, sustained or incurred or required to be paid by

indemnified party, on the one hand, or a company indemnified party, on the other hand, as the case may be (the "indemnitee"), receives written notice of any third party claim or potential claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding which could give rise to an obligation on the part of the company, on the one hand, or parent, on the other hand, as the case may be, to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") pursuant to section 9.2.1 or 9.2.2, the indemnitee will promptly give the indemnifying party notice thereof (the "indemnification notice"); provided, that the failure to give the indemnification notice promptly will not impair the indemnitee's right to indemnification in respect of such claim, action or proceeding unless, and only to the extent that, the lack of prompt notice adversely affects the ability of the indemnifying party to defend against or diminish the losses arising out of such claim, action or proceeding. delivery of the indemnification notice will be a condition precedent to any liability of the indemnifying party under the provisions for indemnification contained in this agreement. the indemnification notice will contain factual information (to the extent known to the indemnitee) describing the asserted claim in reasonable detail and will include copies of any notice or other document received from any third party in respect of any such asserted claim. the indemnifying party will have the right to assume the defense of a third party claim or suit described in this section 9.2.3 at its own cost and expense

at its option, to participate at its own cost and expense and with counsel of its own choosing (which will be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party) in the defense of such claim or suit; and the indemnifying party diligently prosecutes the defense of such claim or suit. in the event that all of the conditions of the foregoing provision are not satisfied, the indemnitee will have the right, without impairing any of its rights to indemnification as provided herein, to assume and control the defense of such claim or suit and to settle such claim or suit. no settlement of any such third party claim or suit will be made by the indemnifying party without the prior written consent of the indemnitee (which will not be unreasonably withheld). no settlement of any such third party claim or suit will be made by the indemnitee if the indemnifying party will have assumed the defense thereof and will be in compliance with its obligations 54 with respect thereto as set forth above in this section 9.2.3. if the indemnifying party chooses to defend any claim, the indemnitee will make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense. notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee will have the right to employ separate counsel at the indemnifying party's expense and to control its own defense of such asserted liability if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnitee (i) there are or may be legal defenses available to such indemnitee or to other indemnitees that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (ii) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnifying party and such indemnitee that would make such separate representation advisable. 9.2.4 the indemnification contained in section 9.2 shall not apply to the extent that a loss has been reimbursed pursuant to the adjustment. section 9.3 entire agreement; assignment. this agreement, the confidentiality agreement and the technology agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) will not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; provided that parent may assign its rights and obligations in whole or in part (other than the rights of parent to nominate directors to the board pursuant to section 6.14) to any affiliate of parent, but no such assignment will relieve parent of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon parent's successors and permitted assigns. section 9.4 notices. all notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder will be in writing and will be given (and will be deemed to
