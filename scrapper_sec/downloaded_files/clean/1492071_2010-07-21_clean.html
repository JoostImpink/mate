source and amount of funds or other consideration. on december 21, 2009, the issuer entered into a securities purchase agreement with jh partners, llc, as the investor representative, and jh evergreen, jhip iii and jhip gp iii (collectively, the &#147; investors &#148;), as amended december 24, 2009, december 30, 2009 and january 20, 2010 (as amended, the &#147; spa &#148;). pursuant to the spa, on january 8, 2010 the issuer completed the sale to the investors of 22,000 shares of a newly authorized series of the issuer&#146;s capital stock entitled series b cumulative preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#147; series b preferred &#148;), and 196,702 shares of a newly authorized series of the issuer&#146;s capital stock entitled series c junior participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#147; series c preferred &#148; and together with the series b preferred, the &#147; preferred shares &#148;), for an aggregate purchase price of $22.0 million in cash (the &#147; closing &#148;).&#160; the source of the $22.0 million used by the investors to purchase the preferred shares was an advance against a line of credit with silicon valley bank secured by the investors&#146; ability to call capital. 7 cusip no. 452439201 pursuant to the spa, the investors received the right (the &#147; purchase right &#148;) to purchase up to an additional 7,400 shares of series b preferred and 66,163.4 shares of series c preferred for an aggregate purchase price of $7.4 million. the 7,400 shares of series b preferred and the 66,163.4 shares of series c preferred are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147; additional preferred shares .&#148; the purchase right was evenly divided into two equal tranches, consisting of 3,700 shares of series b preferred and 33,081.7 shares of series c preferred.&#160; the investors had the right, at any time during the period commencing on the initial closing date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (pst) on the date 120 days after the initial closing date, to exercise the first tranche in whole or in part and in one or more instances.&#160; the investors&#146; rights under the first tranche have expired unexercised.&#160; the investors continue to have the right, at any time during the period commencing on the initial closing date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (pst) on the date that is 360 days after the initial closing date, to exercise the second tranche in whole or in part and in one or more instances. the decision to exercise the purchase right for the second tranche will be made by the investors in their sole discretion, and the investors are not required to exercise the purchase right.&#160; the net proceeds from the sale of any additional preferred shares may only be used by the issuer to (i) acquire rights to additional audio and video entertainment programming, (ii) repay any over-advance under the issuer&#146;s loan and security agreement, as amended (the &#147; loan agreement &#148;), with wachovia capital finance corporation (western), as agent for the lenders (&#147; wachovia &#148;), and the other lenders thereto or (iii) repay accounts payable incurred by the issuer in the ordinary course of business. the series c preferred is convertible, at the holder&#146;s option, into shares of common stock at a ratio of 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of series c preferred (subject to adjustment).&#160; unless the conversion ratio is adjusted, the conversion of the initial 196,702 shares of series c preferred would result in the issuance of 196,702,000 shares of common stock and the conversion of the 33,081.7 shares of series c preferred covered by the second tranche would result in the issuance of 33,081,700 shares of common stock, for a total of 229,783,700 shares of common stock. if at any time a holder of series c preferred seeks to convert shares of series c preferred and the issuer does not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock available to effect such conversion, the issuer must promptly (i) take all action within its control to cause a sufficient number of additional shares to be authorized and (ii) issue to the holder all of the shares of common stock that are available to effect such conversion.&#160; the number of shares of series c preferred sought to be converted that exceeds the amount that is then convertible into available shares of common stock will not be convertible until the date additional shares are authorized to permit such conversion.&#160; the series c preferred will automatically convert into shares of the common stock when there are sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to effect the conversion in full of the series c preferred stock after taking into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding rights, warrants and options and upon conversion of outstanding convertible securities.&#160; as of the date hereof, the issuer had 31,970,318 shares of common stock outstanding or reserved for issuance, not including shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of series c preferred.&#160; as a result, only 68,029,682 shares of common stock are authorized and not issued or reserved for issuance, which amount is not sufficient to allow the conversion in full of the series c preferred issued on the initial closing date plus the shares of series c preferred issuable upon the investor&#146;s exercise of the purchase right. see item 5. item 4. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction. the reporting persons acquired the shares of common stock for investment purposes.&#160; the reporting persons evaluate their investment in the shares of common stock on a continuing basis.&#160; the reporting persons currently have no plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j), inclusive, of item 4 of schedule 13d.&#160; the reporting 8 cusip no. 452439201 persons may, however, from time to time in their discretion, review or reconsider their position with respect to the shares of common stock and any such matters.&#160; the reporting persons retain the right to (a) change their investment intent, (b) make further acquisitions of shares of common stock from one or more sellers in the open market or otherwise, (c) dispose of all or a portion of the shares in the open market or otherwise, (d) acquire or dispose of beneficial ownership of other securities of the issuer, (e) review the performance of the issuer with the issuer&#146;s management and/or the board of directors, (f) communicate with other stockholders of the issuer, and/or (g) take any other action with respect to the issuer, its stockholders or any of the issuer&#146;s debt or equity securities, including, but not limited to, the shares, in any manner permitted by law. pursuant to the closing conditions of the spa, on january 7, 2010, each member of the then-current board of directors of the issuer (the &#147; board &#148;), which included ira s. epstein, gary haber, m. trevenen huxley and robert j. mccloskey, resigned from the board effective immediately after the closing of the issuance of the initial shares of preferred stock of the issuer pursuant to the spa (the &#147; closing &#148;). on january 7, 2010, the then-current board appointed theodore green, patrick collins and michael john to the board effective immediately after the closing.&#160; mr. john is the sole class i director, mr. collins is the sole class ii director and mr. green is the sole class iii director.&#160; the investors designated theodore s. green, patrick m. collins and michael john to be elected.&#160; mr. collins and mr. john are employed by jh partners, llc. item 5. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; interest in securities of the issuer. (a)-(b) jh evergreen management has the sole voting and dispositive power with respect to 209,219,400 shares of common stock, representing approximately 88.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, based on an aggregate of 26,605,718 shares of common stock outstanding as reported by the issuer in its annual report on form 10-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on june 29, 2010.&#160;
