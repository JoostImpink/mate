in an amount sufficient to pay for the acquisition of all of the peru copper shares sought under the offer. chinalco has adequate arrangements in place to provide for the funding of bidco through a

facility ") received from exim china bank, which provides for potential funding by way of bank loans of up to us$1 billion. the loan facility, if drawn, will be subject to terms customary for such

references to, and descriptions of, the support agreement and the lock-up agreements as set forth above in this item 3 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the support agreement, as amended, and the lock-up agreements included as exhibits 2 and 3, and exhibits 4 through 8 to this schedule 13d, respectively, and which are incorporated herein in their entirety by this

subject to applicable law, bidco reserves the right to withdraw the offer and to not take up and pay for any peru copper shares deposited in the offer unless each of the conditions to the offer is satisfied or, where permitted, waived by bidco at or prior to the expiry time of the offer. if the conditions of the offer are satisfied or waived and bidco takes up and pays for the peru copper shares validly deposited under the offer, bidco intends to acquire any peru copper shares not deposited under the offer through a compulsory acquisition under section 206 of the canadian business corporations act (the " cbca "), if available, or to propose a subsequent acquisition transaction, in each case for cash consideration per peru copper share equal in value to the consideration paid by bidco per peru copper share under the offer. the timing and details of any such transaction will depend upon a number of factors, including the number of peru copper shares acquired pursuant to the offer. peru copper has agreed that immediately following the acquisition pursuant to the offer by bidco of at least a majority of the outstanding peru copper shares, and from time to time thereafter, peru copper will cooperate with bidco and upon request will use its reasonable efforts, subject to the provisions of the cbca, to secure the resignations of such number of peru copper directors as may be required to enable bidco to designate such number of directors as is proportional to the percentage of outstanding peru copper shares owned by bidco. peru copper has also agreed that, during the period from the date of the support agreement until the support agreement is terminated by its terms, unless bidco shall otherwise agree in writing, and except as otherwise expressly permitted or specifically contemplated by the support agreement: (a) it will conduct its business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice and in compliance with applicable laws; (b) it will not do

conditions to the offer, (xiii) incurring of debt or liabilities or the making of loans or advances outside the ordinary course of business; (xiv) incurring of capital expenditures outside the ordinary course of business and over a certain value; (xv) the discharge of material claims, liabilities or obligations outside the ordinary course of business; (xvi) the relinquishment of material rights or material change to material contracts or material permits including mining rights, concessions, claims and related options; (xvii) the entering into of certain contracts; (xviii) the

intends to advance peru copper's toromocho project, which is a porphyry copper, potentially open pittable, mineral deposit situated in the morococha district in central peru. if permitted by applicable law, subsequent to the completion of the offer and a compulsory acquisition or any subsequent acquisition transaction, if necessary, bidco intends to delist the peru copper shares from the toronto stock exchange, american stock exchange and lima stock exchange and cause peru copper to cease to be a reporting issuer under the securities laws of each province of canada in which it is a reporting issuer. bidco also intends to seek to cause peru copper to apply for termination of registration of the peru copper shares under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the " exchange act "), as soon after the completion of the offer as the requirements for such termination are met. except as otherwise set forth in this schedule 13d, the reporting persons do not have any present plans, arrangements or understandings that relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the issuer, or the disposition of securities of the issuer; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer's business

act; or 8 (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer the information set forth and/or incorporated by reference in items 2, 3 and 4 is hereby incorporated by reference into this item 5. as of the date hereof, the reporting persons own 13,200,000 peru copper shares (the " current shares "). for purposes of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, however, as a result of entering into the lock-up agreements, the reporting persons may be deemed to possess beneficial ownership of an aggregate of 57,268,809 peru copper shares (representing approximately 40.9% of peru copper shares outstanding as of june 22, 2007 on a fully diluted basis). the reporting persons and the other persons listed on schedule i hereto, however, disclaim beneficial ownership of such peru copper shares (other than the current shares), and this statement shall not be construed as an admission the reporting persons or those listed on schedule i hereto is the beneficial owner for any purpose of the peru copper shares covered by this 13d disclosure (other than the current shares). (a) as of the date hereof, pursuant to the lock-up agreements, the reporting persons may beneficially own an aggregate of 57,268,809 peru copper shares (representing approximately 40.9% of peru copper shares outstanding as of june 22, 2005 on a fully diluted basis). the 57,268,809 peru copper shares the reporting persons may beneficially own consist of the 13,200,000 current shares, 37,226,309 peru copper shares held by the locked-up shareholders, and 6,842,500 peru copper shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options held by the locked-up shareholders. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, to the best of chinalco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither chinalco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto owns any peru copper shares. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, to the best of bidco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither bidco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto owns any peru copper shares. (b) prior to june 11, 2007, none of the reporting persons owned or was the "beneficial owner" (as defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act) of any peru copper shares. upon execution of the support agreement and the lock-up agreements, the reporting persons may be deemed to have acquired "beneficial ownership" (as defined in rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act) of the peru copper shares, because pursuant to the support agreement and the lock-up agreements, the reporting persons may be deemed to have acquired the shared power to vote or direct the vote and to dispose or to direct the disposition of the 57,268,809 peru copper shares (representing approximately 40.9% of peru copper shares outstanding as of june 22, 2007 on a fully diluted basis). as of june 19, 2007, the reporting persons had sole voting and investment power over the current shares. upon the consummation of the offer, the reporting persons would have sole voting and investment power over all such other peru copper shares held by the locked-up shareholders. 9 (c) except for the transactions described herein, to the best of chinalco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither chinalco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto has effected any transaction in peru copper shares during the past 60 days. except for the transactions described herein, to the best of bidco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither bidco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto has effected any transaction in peru copper shares during the past 60 days. (d) other than the locked-up shareholders identified in item 3 and in the lock-up agreements included as exhibits 4 through 8 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference, to the best of chinalco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither chinalco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto has or knows any other person who has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, any peru copper shares beneficially owned by chinalco. to the best of bidco's knowledge as of the date hereof, neither bidco nor any of its directors and executive officers named in schedule i hereto has or knows any other person who has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, any peru copper shares beneficially owned by bidco. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer the information set forth and/or incorporated by reference in items 2 through 5 is hereby incorporated by reference into this item 6. as described in item 3, on june 11, 2007, chinalco entered into the support agreement with peru copper and the lock-up agreements with the locked-up shareholders. as of june 11, 2007, the locked-up shareholders owned an aggregate of 37,226,309 peru copper shares and held options to purchase an additional 6,842,500 peru copper shares, all of which are subject to the terms and conditions of the lock-up agreements (the " locked-up shareholders' shares "). on a fully diluted basis, as of the date of the lock-up agreements, the locked-up shareholders' shares represented approximately 34% of the outstanding peru copper shares. pursuant to the support agreement, on june 19, 2007, bidco purchased 13,200,000 peru copper shares from peru copper on a private placement basis, at a price of u.s.$4.99 per peru copper share. under the lock-up agreements, the locked-up shareholders each agreed to (a) validly tender the locked-up shareholders' shares in acceptance of the offer and (b) except as permitted by the lock-up agreements, not withdraw the locked-up shareholders' shares from the offer. each locked-up shareholder has agreed that, except as permitted under the lock-up agreements, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or engage in discussion regarding any alternative transaction, provided that the lock-up agreement does not prevent any nominee or representative of any locked-up shareholder who is also a director of peru copper from engaging in deliberations as a member of peru copper's board of directors in respect of an unsolicited bona fide alternative transaction under the terms of the support agreement. the lock-up agreement with paul stein, the corporate secretary of peru copper, does not include the above non-solicitation covenant. 10 in addition, each locked-up shareholder has agreed to give notice of or enter into such agreements as may be necessary to cause the exercise of any options, warrants, rights or other securities held or controlled by the locked-up shareholder that are exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable for peru copper shares, effective immediately prior to the expiry time of the offer, and to tender such option shares in acceptance of the offer, provided that such exercise and tendering are conditional upon bidco's confirmation of its intention to take-up the peru copper shares tendered into the offer. bidco has agreed with peru copper to permit peru copper to amend its option plan and any applicable option agreements to permit the exercise of such options on a cashless basis or to otherwise facilitate the payment or settlement of the exercise price thereunder and the tender of the option shares on a guaranteed delivery basis. mr. george ireland, a director of peru copper, also controls peru copper shares through geologic resource fund ltd. and geologic resource fund lp (collectively, " geologic resource ") as a managing member and chief executive officer of these companies. a letter signed on behalf of geologic resource acknowledges that it will tender its peru copper shares to the offer. however, in the event that a third party proposes a transaction to all shareholders of peru copper pursuant to which it will acquire all of the peru copper shares and if in the opinion of geologic resource, the value of the consideration per peru copper share offered under the competing offer is greater than the value of consideration per peru copper share payable pursuant to the offer, geologic resource reserves the right to tender to the competing offer. mr. luis baertl, a founder and former advisor of peru copper, beneficially holds peru copper shares through ranchu copper investments limited (" ranchu "). in a letter dated june 10, 2007, ranchu has agreed to tender 3,500,000 peru copper shares to the offer. however, this obligation terminates if: (a) without ranchu's consent, bidco: (i) increases the minimum tender condition in the terms and conditions of the offer; (ii) decreases the consideration per peru copper share; (iii) changes the form of consideration payable under the offer (other than to increase the total consideration and/or add additional consideration or consideration alternatives); (iv) decreases the number of peru copper shares in respect of which the offer is made; or (v) imposes additional conditions to the offer or otherwise materially varies the offer (or any terms or conditions thereof) in a manner which is adverse to ranchu; (b) ranchu's 3,500,000 peru copper shares are not acquired by bidco by the date on which the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; or (c) bidco has not (for any reason other than the failure of ranchu to tender its 3,500,000 per copper shares) taken up and paid for the 3,500,000 peru copper shares tendered under the offer. in the event a third party proposes a competing offer to all shareholders of peru copper pursuant to which it will acquire all of the peru copper shares and which in the opinion of ranchu, the value of the consideration per peru copper share offered under the competing offer is greater than the value of consideration per peru copper share payable pursuant to the offer, ranchu reserves the right to tender to the competing offer. 11 references to, and descriptions of, the support agreement and the lock-up agreements as set forth above in this item 6 are qualified in their entirety by
