subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement, fox kids shall indemnify each of liberty and life against and hold each of liberty and life harmless from all losses arising out of (i) the

the fox kids certificate of designations, the npal certificate of amendment, the exchange agreement or the funding agreement. 11.5 claims. if any claim or assertion of liability is made or asserted against a party entitled to be indemnified pursuant to section 11.3 or 11.4 (an "indemnified party") by any person who is not a party to this agreement, the indemnified party shall give to the other party (an "indemnifying party") prompt written notice of such claim or assertion, or of any event or proceeding 21 by or in respect of a third party of which it has knowledge, concerning any liability or damage as to which it may request indemnification hereunder. the failure by an indemnified party to give notice as provided in this section 11.5 shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 11.5 except to the extent that the failure results in a failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party is damaged solely as a result of the failure to give notice. the indemnifying party shall have the right to direct, through counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense. if the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnified party may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnified party; provided, however, that if the indemnified party asserts that there exists a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the counsel for the indemnifying party concurs with such assertion, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel, to the extent such fees and expenses are incurred solely in connection with the matters with respect to which the counsel for the indemnifying party agrees there is a conflict of interest. the indemnified party shall provide the indemnifying party with access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith, as such expenses are incurred. if the indemnifying party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the indemnified party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability, unless the indemnifying party, subject to the penultimate sentence of this section 11.5, withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the indemnifying party is entered against the indemnified party for such liability. if the indemnifying party fails to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the indemnifying party fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the indemnifying party's expense. if the indemnified party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this section 11.5 and proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego appeal with respect thereto, then the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding. the indemnifying party shall not settle any claim or assertion unless the indemnified party consents in writing to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 12. miscellaneous provisions. ------------------------ 12.1 notices. all notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed

making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a merger, acquisition, consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any significant portion of the assets or any equity securities of, the company or any of its subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to

acquisition proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal; (b) that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,

obligations undertaken in this section 6.7; and (c) that it will notify fkww and fkw sub immediately if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is received from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, it; provided, however, that nothing -------- ------- contained in this section 6.7 shall prohibit the board of directors of the company from (i) furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited bona fide proposal to acquire the company pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, purchase of a substantial portion of the assets, business combination or other similar transaction, if, and only to the extent that (a) the board of directors determines in good faith, based as to legal matters on advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would involve a substantial risk of breach of fiduciary duty to the company's shareholders imposed by applicable law, (b) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, the company provides notice to fkww and fkw sub to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, and (c) subject to any confidentiality agreement with such person or entity (which the company executed after determining in good faith, based as to legal matters on advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would involve a substantial risk of breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duty to stockholders imposed by applicable law), the company keeps fkww and fkw sub informed of the status (not the terms) of any such discussions or negotiations; and (ii) to the extent applicable, complying with rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the exchange act with regard to an acquisition proposal. nothing in this section

the event fkww and the other parties ------------------ thereto consummate the purchase of the company stock from the robertson sellers pursuant to the robertson purchase agreement prior to the closing of the merger, fkww shall, from and after such closing, be entitled to designate, at its option, upon notice to the company, up to that number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the company's board of directors, subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the exchange act, as will make the percentage of the company's directors designated by fkww equal to the aggregate voting power of the shares of company stock held by fkww or any of its subsidiaries (after giving effect to the conversion of the class a stock to class b stock and the conversion of any class c stock and any convertible notes then held by fkww or its subsidiaries into class b stock); provided, however, that the company -------- ------- shall not be obligated and need not appoint any designee or designees to the board of directors of the company who, in the board's good faith judgment, are not fit to be directors of the company; and provided, further, that in the event -------- ------- that fkww designees are elected to the board of directors of the company, such board of directors shall have, until the effective time, at least two directors who are class b directors on the date of this agreement (the "continuing ---------- directors"), and provided, further that, in such event, if the number of - --------- -------- ------- continuing directors shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining continuing directors shall be permitted to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who would be an "independent director" under the rules of the new york stock exchange (such designee to be deemed to be a continuing director for purposes of this agreement) or, if no continuing directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two individuals to fill such vacancies who shall not be officers, directors, employees or affiliates of fkww or any of its affiliates and shall otherwise be "independent directors" under the rules of the new york stock exchange (each designee to be deemed to be a continuing director for purposes of this agreement). to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the company shall take all actions requested by fkww which are reasonably necessary to effect the election of any such designee or designees, including the inclusion in the information statement, or a separate mailing, of the information required by section 14(f) of the exchange act and rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the making of such mailing as part of the information statement or otherwise, as requested by fkww (provided that fkww shall have provided to the company on a timely basis all information required to be included with respect to fkww designees). in connection with the foregoing, the company will promptly either increase the size of the company's board of directors and/or obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable fkww designees to be elected or appointed to the company's board of directors as provided above. following the election or appointment of fkww's designees pursuant to this section 6.8 and prior to the effective time, any amendment, or waiver of any term or condition, of this agreement or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or restated by-laws of the company, any termination of this agreement by the company, any extension by the company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of fkww or fkw sub or waiver or assertion of any of the company's rights hereunder, or any other consents or actions by the board of directors with respect to this agreement or the guaranty, will require, and will require only, the concurrence of a majority of the continuing directors, except to the extent that applicable law 26 requires that such action be acted upon by the full board of directors, in which case such action will require the concurrence of a majority of the directors, which majority shall include each of the continuing directors, and no other action by the company shall be required for purposes of this agreement. after the date of this agreement, until the earlier of (i) the effective time, and (ii) the termination of this agreement, fkww will not exercise any rights it may have as a stockholder of the company to effect a change in the composition of the board of directors of the company, except as provided for in this section 6.8. 6.9 indemnification and insurance. fkww shall cause all rights to ----------------------------- indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the past and present directors or officers of the company as provided in the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or restated by-laws with respect to claims arising from service as officers or directors prior to the effective time to survive the merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the effective time (or with respect to claims arising from service as officers or directors prior to the effective time which have not been resolved prior to such sixth anniversary, until the time such matters are finally resolved). fkww shall cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years from the effective time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the company as of the date hereof (provided that the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same amount of coverage (covering known or unknown claims as of the effective time) containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous), copies of which has been previously made available to fkww, with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, to the extent available; provided, however, that the surviving corporation shall not be -------- ------- required to maintain such insurance to the extent the annual premium therefor exceeds 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the company in respect of the current policy or policies (the "maximum amount") but in such case shall -------------- purchase as much comparable coverage as available for the maximum amount. 6.10 officer's certificate. the company, at the request of fkww, --------------------- shall deliver a certificate to fkww executed by an executive officer of the company in the form and with respect to the matters referred to in the attached exhibit a, dated as of the date of the closing of the purchase of the control - --------- stock (as defined in the robertson purchase agreement) by fkww pursuant to terms of the robertson purchase agreement, or, alternatively, inform fkww that it is unable to give such certificate because of the inaccuracy of any of the matters referred to therein. article vii ----------- conditions ---------- 7.1 conditions to obligation of each party to effect the merger.

liability or expense resulting from such indemnifiable matter, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in the final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the action, inaction, participation or contribution of you, acquisition corp., the surviving corporation or any of your or their affiliates or any of your of their (or any of your or their affiliate's) officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors, and then only to the extent of your or their action, inaction, participation or contribution. you shall not be

within 20 days of notice to you of such proposed settlement). in turn, you shall not effect the settlement of any such pending or threatened action or proceeding unless either (i) such settlement includes a full and unconditional release and discharge of each of the indemnified parties subject to such action or proceeding from all liability and potential liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action or proceeding or (ii) without the prior written consent of any indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). upon payment in full of any indemnifiable matter by you or on your behalf to or on behalf of an indemnified party, you (or the party making payment on your behalf) shall be subrogated to any claims that such indemnified party may have to seek reimbursement from any other person relating to such indemnifiable matter; provided, however, that you (or the party making payment on your behalf) shall not exercise any rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnification that you (or such party) may now or hereafter acquire against acquisition corp., the surviving corporation or any of their affiliates or against any indemnified party so long as this commitment letter shall be in effect or you, acquisition corp., the surviving corporation or any of your or their affiliates shall have any obligation to citibank, citicorp securities or any lender hereunder or under any of the loan documentation or any other document executed and delivered in connection herewith or therewith. each of the indemnified parties, if reasonably requested by you, shall cooperate with you in any manner reasonably necessary to permit you to pursue such claims. you agree that no indemnified party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to you, acquisition corp., the surviving corporation or any of your or their shareholders or creditors arising out of, related to or in connection with this commitment letter, the facilities, the loan documentation or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability is found in a final nonappealable judgment
