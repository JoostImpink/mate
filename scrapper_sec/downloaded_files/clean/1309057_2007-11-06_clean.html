mr. sun is a citizen and resident of the people&#8217;s republic of china. item 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; source and amount of funds or other consideration . &#160; the amount of funds used to purchase 22,000,545 shares from thomas bontems, the majority shareholder of the issuer, was $500,000, and an additional 2,061,200 shares were issued to mr. sun pursuant to an agreement with the issuer in which the consideration was the cancellation of mr. sun&#8217;s 4,000,000 shares of a convertible preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share, for a total of 24,061,745 shares of common stock which are the subject of this report. the $500,000 in funds which were used to purchase the shares from thomas bontems were derived from the personal resources of mr. sun. item 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; purpose of transaction . &#160; the purpose of the transaction was to acquire majority control of the outstanding common stock of the issuer and thereafter negotiate a share exchange agreement with the issuer pursuant to which mr. sun would exchange all of the share capital of china health industries holdings, a company organized and existing under the hong kong sar of the people&#8217;s republic of china (&#8220;china health&#8221;), which company is wholly owned by mr. sun, for common stock of the issuer, with china heath becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the issuer. &#160; mr. sun was successful in acquiring majority control of the outstanding common stock of the issuer. pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated september 10, 2007 (the &#8220;securities purchase agreement&#8221;), mr. sun acquired 22,000,545 shares of common stock from thomas bontems, and 2,061,200 shares of common stock from the issuer for an aggregate of 24,061,745 shares of common stock, representing 53.8% of the 44,694,634 outstanding and issued shares of common stock. a copy of the securities purchase agreement is attached as exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; as part of the securities purchase agreement, the issuer and universal fog systems, inc., an arizona corporation an affiliate of thomas bontems (&#8220;universal fog systems&#8221;), entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement, dated september 10, 2007 (the &#8220;asset purchase and sale agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which the issuer agreed to dispose of all of its &#8220;assets&#8221; and pay and satisfy all of its &#8220;liabilities,&#8221; as such terms are defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the asset purchase and sale agreement did not contemplate an ordinary sale from the issuer to universal fog systems, but was structured to occur in two stages. if an ordinary sale of assets and liabilities to universal fog systems would have been consummated, the issuer would have had to authorize such sale by shareholder action, including preparing and filing an information statement on schedule 14c with the commission, so long as the issuer were deemed to have engaged in a sale of &#8220;all or substantially all&#8221; of it assets under section 271 of the delaware general corporation law. to avoid this result, and the incident delay associated with a shareholder action, the issuer&#8217;s liabilities were conveyed at closing on september 10, 2007, and its assets will be conveyed only after a share exchange with china health is completed. this structure would enable the issuer to convey assets to universal fog systems that were substantially less than the incoming assets to be acquired in the proposed share exchange. a copy of the asset purchase and sale agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160; - 3 - &#160; as a majority shareholder of the issuer, mr. sun was successful in negotiating a share exchange with management pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated october 15, 2007 (the &#8220;share exchange agreement&#8221;), in which all of the share capital of china health will be exchanged for 60,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer. the share exchange is conditioned on the prior consummation by the issuer of a 1:20 reverse stock split of the common stock of the issuer. as a result of these transactions, mr. sun will own 61,203,087 shares of common stock, representing 98.3% of the 62,234,732 shares of common stock of the issuer that will be outstanding after the share exchange and reverse stock split.&#160;&#160;a copy of the share exchange agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.3, and is incorporated herein by reference. &#160;
