the description of stock and investment agreement (attached hereto as exhibit 1, exhibit 2 and exhibit 3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference), the purchasers will purchase the common shares covered by this statement. 14 share purchase agreement the following description of the share purchase agreement is a summary thereof and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the share purchase agreement (which is attached as exhibit 1 hereto and incorporated by reference). pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the company agreed to sell to the purchasers, and the purchasers agreed to purchase from the company, a total of 15,000 preferred shares for a price of $10,000 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $150,000,000. the sale and purchase of the preferred shares (the "closing") will take place upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the share purchase agreement, including the obtaining of approvals from the connecticut department of insurance and the bermuda monetary authority. under the terms of the share purchase agreement, the company is obligated to seek and obtain appropriate stockholder approval by the holders of the company's common shares, at a meeting of its stockholders, including approval of (i) the issuance of the preferred shares and the convertible common shares issuable upon conversion thereof, (ii) the creation of convertible common shares, (iii) an increase in the size of the board of directors from nine members to eleven members and (iv) the establishment of class iv directors. pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the board of directors of the company shall recommend such approval, and the company shall solicit such approval. in the event that the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement are not consummated as a result of a breach by the company of certain of its obligations thereunder, a failure to obtain shareholder approval of the transactions or acceptance by the board of directors of the company of an unsolicited proposal by a third party, then the company is obligated to pay to the purchasers a termination fee of $7,000,000. description of stock the following description of the description of stock (the "description of stock") is a summary thereof and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the description of stock (which is attached as exhibit 2 hereto and incorporated by reference). the preferred shares shall, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon a liquidation event (as defined below), rank prior to any other class or series of capital or preferred stock already established or that may be established by the board of directors of the company and shall rank pari passu with each other. the holders of the preferred shares shall be entitled to receive quarterly dividends with respect to each preferred share equal to eight percent (8%) per annum, payable for the first three years in additional preferred shares. in the event that such payment in preferred shares would result in the purchasers and their affiliates owning more than 49.9% of the capital stock of the company on a fully diluted basis, then the company, at its option, may pay such dividends in cash. after the third anniversary of the closing, dividends are payable in cash. the preferred shares shall be convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of convertible common stock at any time ("optional conversion"). upon the third anniversary of the closing, if not previously converted by the holders thereof, 10,000 preferred shares will be converted ("first mandatory conversion") to class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares (the "convertible common shares"). upon the sixth anniversary of the closing, all remaining preferred shares will be converted into convertible common shares ("second mandatory conversion", and together with the first mandatory conversion the "mandatory conversion"). the convertible common shares will be converted to common shares upon transfer of such shares by the purchasers to non-affiliated third parties. 15 upon the first mandatory conversion, the preferred shares subject to conversion will be convertible into the number of fully paid and non-assessable convertible common shares determined by dividing the liquidation preference (as defined below) by the current conversion price (as defined in the description of stock), if the current conversion price is equal to or less than the fair market value (as defined in the description of stock) of the common shares as of the conversion date (the "conversion date fmv"). if the conversion date fmv is greater than the current conversion price, the current conversion price used in the quotient above will be adjusted to equal the sum of (x) the product obtained by multiplying the conversion date fmv by 0.8 plus (y) the product obtained by multiplying the current conversion price as of the conversion date by 0.2. upon any second mandatory conversion, the remaining preferred shares will be convertible into the number of fully paid and non-assessable convertible common shares determined by dividing the liquidation preference by the current conversion price. notwithstanding the foregoing, if upon any optional conversion or mandatory conversion the purchasers and their affiliates would, in the aggregate, own more than 49.9% of the capital stock of the company on a fully diluted basis, the company may, at its option, to the extent necessary to prevent the purchasers from owning more than 49.9% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis, make a cash payment in lieu of a payment of convertible common shares equal to the fair market value of the common shares into which such convertible common shares would be converted. together with such payment, the company must make an additional payment to cover certain taxes incurred by the purchasers as result of receiving such cash payment. the preferred shares are originally convertible at a conversion price of $15.69 (the "conversion price"). the conversion price is subject to weighted average anti-dilution protection if the company issues capital stock at less than fair market value. other than with respect to the election of directors (described below), the holder of each preferred share shall have the right to one vote for each common share into which such preferred shares could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, such holder shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of common shares, and shall be entitled to vote, together with holders of common shares, with respect to any question upon which holders of common shares have the right to vote; provided that the purchasers and their affiliates are subject pursuant to application of bye-law 20(4) of the company to a voting limitation of 49.9% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the company; provided further that the capital z reporting persons and their affiliates shall not be subject to the 9.9% voting limitation set forth in the bye-laws of the company. in addition, the consent of the preferred shares is required for certain actions by the company. the consent of a majority of each series of preferred shares, voting separately, is required for any actions that would have certain adverse effects on such series of preferred shares or the related convertible common shares. in addition, (i) if the purchasers and their affiliates shall own 40% of the preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares and common shares underlying such convertible common shares) purchased by them, then the consent of a majority of each series of preferred shares and related convertible common shares, voting together as a separate class, or (ii) if the purchasers and their affiliates shall own less than 40% of the preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares and common shares underlying such convertible common shares) purchased by them, but with respect to any series of preferred shares, a majority of such series of preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares and common shares underlying such convertible common shares) shall be held by the original purchasers and their affiliates, then the consent of a majority of such series of preferred shares and the related convertible common shares, voting together as a separate class, and shall be required for, among other things, the following actions by the company: (i) certain redemption offers to purchase, tender offers or other acquisitions of the company's capital stock; (ii) certain sales of the company; (iii) transfer of incurrence of certain indebtedness; and (iv) payment of certain dividends. holders of preferred shares and convertible common shares shall vote together, separate from holders of common shares, with respect to the election of directors, and shall be entitled to vote for class iv directors (as defined in the description of stock) as follows: (i) so long as reservoir partners and reservoir master fund and their affiliates and limited partners own at least 30% of the series of preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares) purchased by them under the purchase agreement, one director will be 16 elected by the vote of a majority of such series of preferred shares and the related convertible common shares, voting together as a single class; (ii) so long as capital z fund ii and capital z private fund ii and their affiliates and limited partners own at least 50% of the series of preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares) purchased by them under the purchase agreement, two directors will be elected by the vote of a majority of such series preferred shares and the related convertible common shares, voting together as a single class; (iii) so long as capital z fund ii and capital z private fund ii and their affiliates and limited partners own at least 20% but less than 50% of the series of preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares) purchased by them under the purchase agreement, one director will be elected by the vote of a majority of such series of preferred shares and the related convertible common shares, voting together as a single class; and (iv) so long as rainwater and his affiliates shall own at least 60% of the series of preferred shares (including the related convertible common shares) purchased by him under the purchase agreement, one director will be elected by a vote of the majority of such series of preferred shares and related convertible common shares, voting together as a single class. in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company (each a "liquidation event"), the holders of preferred shares shall be entitled to receive for each outstanding preferred share, in preference to the holders of any junior security, an amount equal to the sum of (x) $10,000 and (y) any accrued and unpaid dividends (the "liquidation preference"). investment agreement the following description of the investment agreement is a summary thereof and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the investment agreement (which is attached as exhibit 3 hereto and incorporated by reference). upon the closing, the company and the purchasers shall enter into the investment agreement. under the investment agreement, the purchasers, their affiliates and any persons or entities acquiring preferred shares or convertible common shares will be prevented from (i) acquiring any material asset of the company or (ii) acquiring additional common shares, except upon conversion of the convertible common shares. for a period of five years following the closing, the purchasers, their affiliates and any persons or entities acquiring preferred shares or convertible common shares will be prevented from (i) selling short or engaging in hedging transactions (except for allowed hedging transactions (as defined in the investment agreement) with respect to any capital stock of the company or (ii) directly or indirectly initiate any proxy contest that seeks control

and provided, further, that any purchaser may assign its rights under this agreement and the other operative documents (i) to any affiliate of such purchaser subject to the prior consent of the company, which consent may be withheld by the company only if such assignment would result or is reasonably likely to result in material negative tax consequences to the company or any of its shareholders (it being understood that no such assignment shall relieve assignor of its obligation hereunder) and (ii) to another purchaser or any affiliate of another purchaser subject to the prior consent of the company, which consent may be withheld by the company only if such assignment would result or is reasonably likely to result in material negative tax consequences to the company or any of its shareholders (it being understood that such assignment will relieve assignor of its obligations hereunder). subject to the preceding sentence, this agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 10.10 headings. the headings used in this agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions hereof. 10.11 invalid provisions. if any provision of this agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance therefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 10.12 governing law. this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the state of new york, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the state of new york or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of new york. 10.13 waiver of jury trial. because disputes arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to apply (rather than arbitration rules), the parties desire that their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable laws. therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of the judicial system and of arbitration, the parties hereto waive all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding brought to enforce or defend any rights or 42 remedies under this agreement, the other operative documents or any documents related hereto. 10.14 jurisdiction. each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the state of new york located in new york county and the united states federal district court of the southern district of new york for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this agreement or the subject matter hereof and agrees that any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such court (and waives any objection based on forum non conveniens or any other objection to venue therein); provided however, that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to in this section 9.16 and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of said courts other than for such purpose. 10.15 construction. the parties hereto agree that this agreement is the product of negotiation between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof. accordingly, ambiguities in this agreement, if any, shall not be construed strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a fair and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of contra proferentum. 10.16 counterparts. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 10.17 publicity. at all times at or before the closing, the parties hereto shall each consult with the other parties hereto before issuing or making any reports, statements, or releases to the public with respect to this agreement or the other operative documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and shall use good faith efforts to agree on the text of a joint public report, statement, or release or shall use good faith efforts to obtain the other parties' approval of the text of any public report, statement, release to be made solely on behalf of a party. 10.18 confidentiality. (a) any information delivered pursuant to the terms of this agreement or received in connection with the negotiation or preparation of this agreement or the other operative documents (including, without limitation, in connection with the performance by the purchasers of their due diligence) which is known or should be known to the receiving party to be confidential shall be kept confidential by the parties and shall not be divulged to third parties, other than to the respective parties' affiliates, members, beneficial interest holders and managers, accountants, attorneys and advisors (collectively, "representatives"); provided that each party shall be responsible for the confidentiality of information given to its respective representatives; and provided further, that any party may disclose any information pursuant to any legal requirement or any court, regulatory or governmental order, request or requirement. each party shall give the other parties notice of any required 43 legal or court, regulatory or governmental disclosure so that such other parties may have an opportunity to seek to prevent or limit disclosure. (b) the provisions of section 10.18(a) shall not apply to information that is (i) received by a party (or an affiliate of such party) that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach by such party or any of its affiliates of the provisions of section 10.18(a), (ii) hereafter lawfully acquired by a party (or an affiliate of such party) on a non-confidential basis from a source that, to such party's knowledge at the time, is not providing such information in violation of a confidentiality or similar agreement with any person or (iii) known to such party prior to receipt thereof from the other party or its affiliates.

(a) general. for the purposes of this section 4, each december 31, march 31, june 30 and september 30 (commencing december 31, 2001) on which any preferred shares shall be outstanding shall be deemed to be a "dividend due date". the holders of the preferred shares shall be entitled to receive, if, when and as declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends on each share (i) at any time such dividends are to be paid in shares of preferred shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the rate of 8% per annum and (ii) at any time such dividends are to be paid in cash in accordance with the terms hereof, the rate of 8% per annum, on the sum of (x) the stated value on each preferred share plus (y) the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and no more, calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days consisting of twelve 30-day months, payable on each dividend due date, with respect to the quarterly period ending on the day immediately preceding such dividend due date (except that if any such date is not a business day, then such dividend shall be payable on the next business day following such dividend due date, provided that for the purposes of computing such dividend payment, no interest or sum in lieu of interest shall accrue from such dividend due date to the next business day following such dividend due date). dividends on each preferred share shall accrue and be cumulative from and after the date of issuance of such preferred share whether or not such dividends are declared and whether or not there shall be net profits or net assets of the company legally available for the payment of such dividends. the amount of dividends payable per share for each full dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the 8% annual rate. the record date for the payment of dividends on the preferred shares shall in no event be more than sixty (60) days nor less than fifteen (15) days prior to a dividend due date. any such dividend that is to be paid in preferred shares shall be payable by delivery to such holders, at their respective addresses as they appear in the stock register, of certificates representing the appropriate number of duly authorized, validly issues, fully paid and nonassessable shares of series a preferred shares to holders of series a preferred shares, series b preferred shares to holders of series b preferred shares and series c preferred shares to holders of series c preferred shares. any such dividend that is to be paid in cash shall be payable by delivery of such cash amounts to such holders at their respective addresses as they appear in the stock register. 15 (b) form of dividends. dividends payable on any dividend due date shall, if declared by the board of directors of the company or any duly authorized committee thereof and regardless of when actually paid, accrue and be payable (i) prior to the third anniversary of the closing, in series a preferred shares to holders of series a preferred shares, in series b preferred shares to holders of series b preferred shares and in series c preferred shares to holders of series c preferred shares and (ii) from and after the third anniversary of the closing, accrue and be payable in cash. the number of series a preferred shares, series b preferred shares or series c preferred shares, as the case may be, so payable on any dividend due date as a dividend per series a preferred share, series b preferred share or series c preferred share, as the case may be, shall be equal to the amount of dividends that would have been payable on such share if such dividend were being paid in cash on such dividend due date divided by the stated value. any additional series a preferred shares, series b preferred shares or series c preferred shares issued pursuant to this section 4(b) shall be governed by this resolution and shall be subject in all respects to the same terms as the series a preferred shares, series b preferred shares and series c preferred shares, respectively, originally issued hereunder. notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, at the sole election of the company contained in a resolution of the board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, in substitution in whole or in part for such dividends payable in preferred shares (pursuant to clause (i) above), such dividends may be paid in cash to the extent of any dividends that, if paid in additional preferred shares, would otherwise cause the purchasers and their affiliates to own more than 49.9% of the capital stock of the company on a fully diluted and fully converted basis. (c) dividend preference. any dividend which shall not be paid on the dividend due date on which it shall become due shall be deemed to be "past due" until such dividend is paid. so long as any dividend in respect of any outstanding preferred share shall be past due at any time such dividends are to be paid in cash in accordance with the terms hereof, the dividend rate applicable to such preferred share shall be increased to 10% per annum compounded quarterly. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section 4, if at any time during which any preferred share remains outstanding the dividend rate payable thereon exceeds the highest rate of interest permissible under any law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto (the "maximum lawful rate"), then in such event and so long as the maximum lawful rate would be so exceeded, the dividend rate of in respect of preferred shares shall be equal to the maximum lawful rate; provided, however, that if at any time thereafter the dividend rate payable thereon is less than the maximum lawful rate, dividends shall continue to accrue thereon at the maximum lawful rate until such time as the total dividends earned are equal to the total dividends which would have been earned had the dividend rate on such preferred share been (but for the operation of this paragraph) the dividend rate payable since the closing. dividends paid on preferred shares in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accumulated and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such preferred shares at the time outstanding. the rights of series a preferred shares, the series b preferred shares and series c preferred shares shall rank pari passu with each other with respect to the right to receive dividends, and such preferred shares 16 shall rank senior in all respects to common shares, the convertible common shares and all other classes and series of capital shares of the company, including without limitation other classes and series of preferred shares other than the trust preferred (collectively, "junior shares"). if a dividend upon any preferred shares, or any other outstanding preferred stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends, is in arrears, all dividends or other distributions declared upon each series of such stock may only be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends or other distributions declared per share of each such series bear to each other the same ratio that the accumulated and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of each such series bear to each other. except as set forth above, if a dividend upon any preferred shares, or any other outstanding stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends, is in arrears: (i) no dividends, in cash, stock or other property, may be paid or declared and set aside for payment or any other distribution made upon any stock of the company ranking junior to the preferred shares as to dividends; (ii) no stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends may be (a) redeemed pursuant to a sinking fund or otherwise, except (1) by means of a redemption pursuant to which all outstanding shares of preferred shares and all stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends are redeemed or pursuant to which a pro rata redemption is made from all holders of the preferred shares and all stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends (in each case, only so long as the preferred shares is otherwise redeemable pursuant hereto), the amount allocable to each series of such stock being determined on the basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and the shares of each series being redeemed only on a pro rata basis or (2) by conversion of such stock ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends into, or exchange of such stock for, junior shares or (b) purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the company except (1) pursuant to an acquisition made pursuant to the terms of one or more offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the preferred shares and all stock of the company ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends (which offers shall describe such proposed acquisition of all such stock ranking on a parity with the preferred shares), which offers shall each have been accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the shares of each series or class of stock receiving such offer outstanding at the commencement of the first of such purchase offers, or (2) by conversion of such stock ranking on a parity with the preferred shares as to dividends into, or exchange of such stock for, junior stock; and (iii) no stock ranking junior to the preferred shares as to dividends may be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for consideration (including pursuant to sinking fund requirements) except by conversion into or exchange for junior shares. 5. liquidation rights.

(b) notice of liquidation. subject to any other requirement under law, written notice of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, stating the payment date or dates when and the place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given (not less than thirty (30) days prior to any payment date stated therein), to the holders of record of the preferred shares at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the register of shareholders of the company. 6. conversion. the following provisions are subject to compliance with applicable law, and if the exercise of these rights would violate relevant law, such rights set out below will be suspended until such rights can be exercised in compliance with applicable law: (a) general. each holder of preferred shares shall have the right, at the option of such holder, at any time to convert, upon the terms and provisions of this section 6, one or more series a preferred shares, series b preferred shares or series c preferred shares into fully paid and nonassessable class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, respectively, or any class of shares or other securities into which such class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares shall have been changed or any class of shares or other securities resulting from a reclassification thereof. (i) such conversion of series a preferred shares to class a common shares shall be made at the conversion rate of one series a preferred share for a number of class a common 18 shares equal to a fraction (the "series a conversion ratio"), (i) the numerator of which is equal to the series a preferred liquidation preference on a per share basis and (ii) the denominator of which is equal to the current conversion price in effect at such time. the class a common shares issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred shares, when such class a common shares shall be issued in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable class a common shares. (ii) such conversion of series b preferred shares to class b common shares shall be made at a conversion rate of one class b preferred share for a number of class b common shares equal to a fraction (the "series b conversion ratio"), (i) the numerator of which is equal the series b liquidation preference on a per share basis and (ii) the denominator of which is equal to the current conversion price in effect at such time. the class b common shares issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred shares, when such class b common shares shall be issued in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable class b common shares.

(b) surrender, election and payment. each preferred share may be converted by the holder thereof during normal business hours on any business day by surrender of such preferred share, accompanied by written evidence of the holder's election to convert such preferred share, to the company at its office designated pursuant to the bye-laws of the company (or, if such conversion is in connection with an underwritten public offering of common shares, at the location at which the underwriting agreement requires that such common shares (or preferred shares) be delivered). payment of the conversion price for the convertible common shares specified in such election shall be made by applying to such payment an aggregate number of preferred shares equal to the number 19 obtained by dividing (x) the number of class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, as the case may be, specified in such election by (y) the series a conversion ratio, the series b conversion ratio or the series c conversion ratio, respectively. such holder shall thereupon be entitled to receive the number of convertible common shares specified in such election. (c) effective date. each conversion of preferred shares pursuant to section 6(c) hereof shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the business day on which such preferred shares shall have been surrendered to the company as provided in section 6(c) hereof, and such conversion shall be at the current conversion price in effect at such time. on each such day that the conversion of preferred shares is deemed effected, the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, as the case may be, are issuable upon such conversion, as provided in section 6(e) hereof, shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of such class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, as the case may be. (d) share certificates. as promptly as practicable after the conversion of any preferred shares, in whole or in part, and in any event within ten (10) business days thereafter, the company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue, stamp or other taxes on the issue of the convertible common shares or on the share certificate therefor, other than any income or capital gains taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the holder thereof or as such holder may direct, a certificate or certificates for the number of class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, as the case may be, to which such holder shall be entitled upon such conversion on the effective date of such conversion. (e) acknowledgment of obligation. the company will, at the time of or at any time after each conversion of preferred shares, upon the request of the holder thereof or of any common shares issued upon such conversion, acknowledge in writing its continuing obligation to afford to such holder all rights, if any, to which such holder shall continue to be entitled; provided, that if any such holder shall fail to make any such request, the failure shall not affect the continuing obligations of the company to afford such rights to such holder. (f) current conversion price. the term "conversion price" shall mean initially $15.69. the term "current conversion price" as used herein shall mean the conversion price, as the same may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided (including, without limitation, pursuant to section 7 hereof), in effect at any given time; provided, however, that the current conversion price shall not be lower than the par value of the class a common shares, the class b common shares or the class c common shares. in determining the current conversion price, the result shall be expressed to the nearest $0.01, but any such lesser amount shall be carried forward and shall be considered at the time of (and together with) the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustments to be carried forward, shall amount to $0.01 per class a common share, class b common share or class c common share more. (g) reservation of convertible common shares and common shares. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of authorized but unissued the maximum number of convertible common shares and 20 common shares into which all preferred shares and convertible common shares, respectively, from time to time issued and outstanding are convertible. (h) mandatory conversion. the following conversion provisions shall also be applicable to the preferred shares: (i) if not previously converted, all of the issued and outstanding a1 preferred shares, b1 preferred shares and c1 preferred shares, inclusive of all dividends paid in preferred shares in accordance with this description of stock, will be mandatorily converted into class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, respectively, on the third anniversary of the closing (the "first mandatory conversion"). if not previously converted by the purchasers, all of the issued and outstanding a2 preferred shares, b2 preferred shares and c2 preferred shares inclusive of all dividends paid in preferred shares in accordance with this description of stock, will be mandatorily converted into class a common shares, class b common shares or class c common shares, respectively, on the sixth anniversary of the closing (the "second mandatory conversion", and collectively with the first mandatory conversion, the "mandatory conversion"). to the extent that less than all of the preferred shares to be converted are converted (for whatever reason) the convertible common shares issued in such mandatory conversion shall be allocated among the holders on a pro rata basis. (ii) the conversion price used in connection with the first mandatory conversion shall be determined as follows: (a) if the current conversion price as of the date of the first mandatory conversion (the "conversion date") is equal to or less than the fair market value of the common shares as of the conversion date (the "conversion date fmv"), the current conversion price used in the first mandatory conversion shall be the conversion price as of the conversion date; (b) if the current conversion price as of the conversion date is greater than the conversion date fmv, the conversion price used in the first mandatory conversion shall equal the sum of (x) the product obtained by multiplying the conversion date fmv by 0.8 plus (y) the product obtained by multiplying the current conversion price as of the conversion date by 0.2. (iii) the conversion price used in connection with the second mandatory conversion shall be the current conversion price as of the date of the second mandatory conversion. (iv) the mechanics for conversion and other provisions relating to the conversion of preferred shares set forth elsewhere in this section 6 and in section 7 hereof 21 shall apply to the automatic conversion of preferred shares pursuant to this section 6(h). 7. adjustment to conversion price. the conversion price shall be adjusted, from time to time, as follows: (a) adjustments for recapitalizations, etc. in case the company shall (i) subdivide its outstanding common shares, (ii) combine the issued and outstanding common shares into a smaller number of shares, (iii) issue by reclassification of common shares, any shares of the company or (iv) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding common shares in capital shares of the company, then, in any such case, the current conversion price in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted to a price such that if the holder of a preferred share were to fully convert such preferred share immediately after such action, such holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of the company which such holder would have owned immediately following such action had such preferred shares been converted immediately prior thereto (with any record date requirement being deemed to have been satisfied), and, in any such case, such conversion price shall thereafter be subject to further adjustments under this section 7. an adjustment made pursuant to this section 7(a) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the effective date. (b) adjustments for issuances of additional shares. subject to the exceptions referred to in section 7(e) hereof, in case the company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof issue any additional common shares ("additional common shares") either (i) for no consideration or (ii) for a consideration per share that is either (a) less than 95% of the fair market value of the common shares on the last day prior to the date of announcement of such issuance in a registered public offering or (b) less than the fair market value of the common shares in a private transaction, then (in the case of either clause (i) or (ii)), and thereafter successively upon each such issuance, the current conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to the following formula: ncp = ocp x ob + x ------ oa where ncp = the new current conversion price ocp = the existing current conversion price immediately before the new issue (the "old conversion price") ob = the total outstanding common shares (on a fully diluted basis immediately before the new issue) x = number of common shares issuable at fair market value of the common shares for the total consideration to be received for the new issue oa = the total outstanding common shares (on a fully diluted basis) immediately after the new issue; 22 provided, however, that any such adjustment shall be made only if such adjustment results in a current conversion price less than the current conversion price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such additional common shares. the company may, but shall not be required to, make any adjustment of the current conversion price if the amount of such adjustment shall be less than one percent (1%) of the current conversion price immediately prior to such adjustment, but any adjustment that would otherwise be required then to be made which is not so made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of (and together with) the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to not less than one percent (1%) of the current conversion price immediately prior to such adjustment. (c) certain rules in applying the adjustment for additional share issuances. for purposes of any adjustment as provided in section 7(b) hereof, the following provisions shall also be applicable: (i) cash consideration. in case of the issuance of additional common shares for cash, the consideration received by the company therefor shall be deemed to be the cash proceeds received by the company for such additional common shares after deducting any commissions or other expenses paid or incurred by the company for any underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with the issuance of such additional common shares. (ii) non-cash consideration. in case of the issuance of additional common shares for a consideration other than cash, or a consideration a part of which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash so received or to be received by the company shall be deemed to be the value of such consideration at the time of its receipt by the company as determined in good faith by the board, except that where the non-cash consideration consists of the cancellation, surrender or exchange of outstanding obligations of the company (or where such obligations are otherwise converted into common shares), the value of the non-cash consideration shall be deemed to be the principal amount of the obligations canceled, surrendered, satisfied, exchanged or converted. if the company receives consideration, part or all of which consists of publicly traded securities (i.e., in lieu of cash), the value of such non-cash consideration shall be the aggregate fair market value of such securities (based on the latest reported sale price regular way) as of the close of the day immediately preceding the date of their receipt by the company. (iii) options, warrants, convertibles, etc. (a) in case of the issuance, whether by distribution or sale to holders of its common shares or to others, by the company of (i) any security (other than preferred shares and convertible common shares) that is convertible into common shares or (ii) any rights, options or warrants to purchase common shares, if inclusion thereof in calculating adjustments under this section 7 would result in a current conversion price lower than if excluded, the 23 company shall be deemed to have issued, for the consideration described below, the number of common shares into which such convertible security may be converted when first convertible, or the number of common shares deliverable upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants when first exercisable, as the case may be (and such shares shall be deemed to be additional common shares for purposes of section 7(b) hereof). (b) the consideration deemed to be received by the company at the time of the issuance of such convertible securities or such rights, options or warrants shall be the consideration so received determined as provided in section 7(c)(i) and (ii) hereof plus (x) any consideration or adjustment payment to be received by the company in connection with such conversion or, as applicable, (y) the aggregate price at which common shares are to be delivered upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants when first exercisable (or, if no price is specified and such shares are to be delivered at an option price related to the fair market value of the subject common shares, an aggregate option price bearing the same relation to the fair market value of the subject common shares at the time such rights, options or warrants were granted). (c) if, subsequently, (1) such number of shares into which such convertible security is convertible, or which are deliverable upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, is increased or (2) the conversion or exercise price of such convertible security, rights, options or warrants is decreased, then the calculations under the preceding two sentences (and any resulting adjustment to the current conversion price under section 7(b) hereof) with respect to such convertible security, rights, options or warrants, as the case may be, shall be recalculated as of the time of such issuance but giving effect to such changes (but any such recalculation shall not result in the current series a conversion price being higher than that which would be calculated without regard to such issuance). (d) on the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants, or rights to convert, the current conversion price hereunder shall be readjusted (up or down as the case may be) to such current conversion price as would have been obtained had the adjustments made with respect to the issuance of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities been made upon the basis of the delivery of only the number of common shares actually delivered upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon the conversion of any such securities and at the actual exercise or conversion prices (but any such recalculation shall not result in the current conversion price being higher than that which would be calculated without regard to such issuance). 24 (iv) number of shares outstanding. the number of common shares at the time outstanding shall exclude all common shares then owned or held by or for the account of the company but shall include the aggregate number of common shares at the time deliverable in respect of outstanding convertible securities, rights, options and warrants; provided, that to the extent that such rights, options, warrants or conversion privileges are not exercised, such common shares shall be deemed to be outstanding only until the expiration dates of the rights, warrants, options or conversion privileges or the prior cancellation thereof. (d) adjustment for development. the current conversion price shall be adjusted upwards or downwards as of each adjustment date (as defined below) by multiplying the current conversion price immediately prior to such adjustment date by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is (x) adjusted shareholders' equity minus (y) the cumulative amount of any loss development (as defined below) recognized after the closing in excess of $7,000,000 (the "ld above deductible") and (ii) the denominator of which is the adjusted shareholders' equity, it being understood that no adjustment pursuant to this section 7(d) shall be made if such adjustment shall increase the initial conversion price as adjusted by the provisions of this section 7 other than those contained in this section 7(d). the ld above deductible shall be applied on an after-tax basis the term "adjusted shareholders' equity" shall mean the common shareholders' equity, as reflected in the gaap financial statements of the company as of september 30, 2001 (the "september financial statement"), provided that such shareholders' equity shall be adjusted by substituting the loss and expense reserves set forth in the definitive loss reserve report (as defined below) for the corresponding reserves set forth in the september financial statement. the term "adjustment dates" shall mean the dates of completion of the annual audit and reserve review of the company by the company's duly appointed auditor with respect to the years ended december 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the term "adjustment date" shall mean any of such dates of completion, as well as the dates of completion of any reserve audit requested by the purchasers. the term "loss development" shall mean (i) any net positive or adverse loss and loss expense reserve development (including without limitation as a result of uncollectible reinsurance, net of any allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recorded as of september 30, 2001, reinstatement premiums and any adjustments in profit commissions and ceding commissions) on reserves for losses incurred on or prior to september 30, 2001 and loss adjustment expenses related thereto and established with respect to (x) the losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the events of september 11, 2001 (the "wtc loss"), (y) lines of business other than the discontinued operations and the wtc loss in an amount not to exceed $12,000,000 on an after-tax basis and (z) the discontinued operations (defined below), in each case as set forth in the loss reserve report delivered to the purchasers on december 10, 2001 (the "definitive loss reserve report"); and (ii) any liability or loss (other than legal fees and expenses) arising out of material litigation existing at the time of closing. the term "discontinued operations" shall mean (i) lloyds' syndicate 1224, (ii) the excess and surplus lines insurance business assumed from transnational insurance company and (iii) the casualty business underwritten by pxre direct underwriting managers, inc. the purchasers shall have the right to request a reserve audit at any time they should reasonably believe it necessary. the reserve audit shall be performed by an independent actuary mutually acceptable to the company and the purchasers (the "appointed actuary"). upon conclusion of the reserve audit, the appointed actuary shall issue a written reserve opinion and the conclusion set forth in such reserve opinion shall be 25 binding upon the company and the purchasers. the expense of any reserve audit requested by the purchasers shall be borne by the purchasers. (e) exclusions from the adjustment for additional share issuances. no adjustment of the current conversion price under section 7(b) hereof shall be made as a result of or in connection with (i) the issuance of common shares upon conversion of the convertible common shares, (ii) the issuance or grant of any options, warrants or other rights convertible into capital shares of the company to employees, officers and directors of the company pursuant to restricted stock agreements or stock options or other equity compensation plans (such plans having been approved by the shareholders of the company), or the issuance of the company's capital shares thereunder, in an amount not to exceed 500,000 common shares per calendar year and 2,100,000 common shares in the aggregate (subject to adjustment pursuant to section 7(a)) or (iii) issuances in connection with an underwritten public offering of common shares at a price 95% or more of the fair market value at the time of such offering. (f) accountants' certification. whenever the current conversion price is adjusted as provided in this section 7, the company will promptly obtain a certificate of the chief financial officer of the company setting forth the current conversion price as so adjusted, the computation of such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, and will mail to the holders of series a preferred shares a copy of such certificate. the holders of the preferred shares may within sixty (60) days object to the calculation of the current conversion price by providing written notice to the company in accordance with the bye-laws of the company, which notice will set forth the basis of such objection. such objection shall be submitted to the company's auditor for review (at the expense of the company) and the determination of the company's auditor shall be binding. (g) other adjustments. in case any event shall occur as to which any of the provisions of this section 7 are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment would not fairly protect the conversion rights represented by the preferred shares in accordance with the essential intent and principles of sections 6 and 7 hereof, then, in each such case, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the preferred shares, the company shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing selected by the board (who may be the regular auditors of the company), which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in sections 6 and 7 hereof, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the conversion rights represented by the preferred shares. upon receipt of such opinion, the company will promptly mail copies thereof to the holders of the preferred shares and shall make the adjustments described therein. (h) consolidation, merger or amalgamation. if the company shall at any time consolidate with or merge into another corporation (where the company is not the continuing corporation after such merger or consolidation) or if the company is amalgamated, or the company shall sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets, or the company shall change its common shares into property other than capital shares of the company, then, in any such case, the holder of a preferred share shall thereupon (and thereafter) be entitled to receive, upon the full conversion of such preferred shares in whole or in part, the securities or other property to which (and upon the same terms and with the same rights as) a holder of the number of common shares deliverable 26 upon full conversion of such preferred share would have been entitled if such full conversion had occurred immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, such sale of assets or such change (with any record date requirement being deemed to have been satisfied), and such conversion rights shall thereafter continue to be subject to further adjustments under this section 7, without limiting any other rights of holders of preferred shares. the company shall take such steps in connection with such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, such sale of assets or such change as may be necessary to assure such holder that the provisions of the shares of preferred shares shall thereafter continue to be applicable in relation to any securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the preferred shares, including, but not limited to, obtaining a written obligation to supply such securities or property upon such conversion and to be so bound by the preferred shares. (i) if any adjustment to the current conversion price pursuant to this section 7 would result in the purchasers and their affiliates being able to convert into more than 49.9% of the capital shares of the company upon a fully diluted and fully converted basis, the company shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect (within 5 business days of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment) to make a cash payment in lieu of effecting such adjustment to the current conversion price. such cash payment shall equal the sum of the fair market value as of the date of conversion of the common shares that the purchasers would have received in excess of the 49.9% limitation upon the full conversion of their preferred shares as of the date of such adjustment plus the related tax gross-up. such cash payment shall be allocated pro rata among the preferred shares and shall be payable upon conversion of any such preferred shares pursuant to section 6 of this description of stock.

and the company will pay to each such holder, affiliate or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 5.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder or controlling person. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. 5.2 indemnification by a holder. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder (including without limitation piggyback holders) will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter, any other holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished (and not subsequently corrected prior to the company's request that the registration statement be declared effective) by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this section 5.2 in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;

provided that in no event shall any indemnity 16 under this section 5.2 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. 5.3 contribution by indemnifying party. (a) if the indemnification provided for in this article v from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (b) the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5.3 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5.4 indemnification procedure. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 5.4 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 5.4, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 5.4 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 5.4. the indemnified party shall have the right, but not 17 the obligation, to participate in the defense of any action referred to above through counsel of its own choosing and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and all separate defenses, cross claims or counterclaims which it may have, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in advance by the indemnifying party, (ii) there is a conflict of interest that prevents counsel for the indemnifying party from adequately representing the interests of the indemnified party or there are defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from, or additional to, the defenses that are available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party does not employ counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time or (iv) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense or does not reasonably contest such action in good faith, in which case, if the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party that it elects to employ separate counsel, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party and the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one firm acting as local counsel) for all indemnified parties. 5.5 underwriting agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement (if any) entered into in connection with any underwritten public offering of the registrable securities are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall control. 5.6 financial assistance. the company shall have no obligation under the provisions of article iv and v unless and until the requirements of any of the exclusions or exemptions applicable to the provisions of section 39 of the companies act of 1981 in bermuda, as amended, are satisfied so as to provide compliance with that section. each holder shall waive or may approve, where formal meetings or written resolutions of shareholders or other action may be appropriate to waive or approve, the financial assistance as described in section 39 and related provisions. the provisions of article v and vi hereof shall be subject to this article 5.6. article vi miscellaneous 6.1 specific performance. in the event of a breach by any party to this investment agreement of its obligations under this investment agreement, any party injured by such breach, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this investment agreement. the parties agree that the provisions of this investment agreement shall be specifically enforceable, it being agreed by the parties that the remedy at law, including monetary damages, for breach of any such provision will be inadequate 18 compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. 6.2 amendments. this agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a written agreement signed by the company, the required capital z holders, the required reservoir holders and the required rainwater holders. 6.3 successors and assigns. this investment agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the benefits of this investment agreement shall inure to and be enforceable by any transferee of registrable securities only if such transferee shall have executed a joinder agreement. 6.4 notices.
