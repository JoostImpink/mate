piggyback registration &#8221;).&#160;&#160;any such person that has made such a written request may withdraw its registrable securities from such piggyback registration by giving written notice to the company and the managing underwriter, if any, on or before the fifth business day prior to the planned effective date of such piggyback registration. the company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this section &#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(5) &#160;&#160;&#160; if the registration referred to in section &#160; 4.6(a)(4) is proposed to be underwritten, the company will so advise the investors and all other holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to section 4.6(a)(4).&#160;&#160;in such event, the right of the investors and all other holders to registration pursuant to this section 4.6(a) will be conditioned upon such persons&#8217; participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such persons&#8217; registrable securities in the underwriting, and each such person will (together with the company and the other persons distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the company.&#160;&#160;if any participating person disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company, the managing underwriter and the investor. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(6) &#160;&#160;&#160; the company represents and warrants that, other than in connection with the other securities purchase agreements, it has not granted to any holder of its securities and agrees that it shall not grant &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights to one or more third parties to include their securities in the shelf registration statement or in an underwritten offering under the shelf registration statement pursuant to section 4.6(a)(2).&#160;&#160;if a piggyback registration under section 4.6(a)(4) relates to an underwritten primary offering on behalf of the company, and the managing underwriters advise the com pany that in their reasonable opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the company will include in such registration or prospectus only such number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities will be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, in the case of a piggyback registration under section 4.6(a)(4), the securities the company proposes to sell, (ii) second, registrable securities of the investors and all &#160; &#160; -46- &#160; &#160; other holders who have requested registration of registrable securities pursuant to section 4.6(a)(2) or 4.6(a)(4), as applicable, pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of such securities or shares owned by each such person and (iii) third, any other securities of the company that have been requested to be so included, subject to the terms of this agreement. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; expenses of registration .&#160;&#160;all registration expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance hereunder shall be borne by the company.&#160;&#160;the company shall bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of their officers and employees performing legal, accounting or other duties) and expenses of any person, including special experts, retained by the company.&#160;&#160;the company shall also reimburse the investors for the reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel to the investors in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per registration.&#160;&#160;all selling expenses incurre d in connection with any registrations hereunder shall be borne by the holders of the securities so registered pro rata on the basis of the aggregate offering or sale price of the securities so registered. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; obligations of the company .&#160;&#160;the company shall use its reasonable best efforts for so long as there are registrable securities outstanding, to take such actions as are under its control to remain a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in rule 405 under the securities act) if it becomes eligible for such status in the future (and not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in rule 405 under the securities act)).&#160;&#160;in addition, whenever required to effect the registration of any registrable securities or facilitate the distribution of registrable securities pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably practicable: &#160;

provided that the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions. &#160;

&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(iii) &#160;&#160;&#160; of the issuance by the sec of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;

&#160; -48- &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(7) &#160;&#160;&#160; use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance or obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement referred to in section 4.6(c)(6)(iii) at the earliest practicable time. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(8) &#160;&#160;&#160; upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by section 4.6(c)(5) &#160; or 4.6(c)(6)(v), promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to such registration statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the holders and any underwriters, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.&#160;&#160;if the company notifies the holders in accordance with section 4.6(c)(6)(v) &#160; to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the holders and any underwriters shall suspend use of such prospectus and use their reasonable best efforts to return to the company all copies of such prospectus (at the company&#8217;s expense) other than permanent file copies then in such holder&#8217;s or underwriter&#8217;s possession.&#160;&#160;the total number of days that any such suspension may be in effect in any 180-day period shall not exceed 30 days. &#160;

and &#160; &#160; (c) &#160; in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. &#160; &#160; (b) &#160; all adjustments to the conversion price shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10 of a cent.&#160;&#160;no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required if such adjustment would be less than $0.01; provided , that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; provided further that on the mandatory conversion date, adjustments to the conversion price will be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date.&#160;&#160;when any adjustment is to be made in respect of a distribution of common stock or rights or warrants to purchase common stock, such adjustment shall also be made for any securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock. &#160; &#160; (c) &#160; no adjustment to the conversion price shall be made if holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, as a result of holding the series b preferred stock (including without limitation pursuant to section&#160;4 hereof), without having to convert the series b preferred stock, as if they held the full number of shares of common stock into which a share of the series b preferred stock may then be converted. &#160; &#160; (d) &#160; notwithstanding anything contained herein, the applicable conversion price shall not be adjusted: &#160; &#160; exhibit a-14 &#160; &#160; (i) &#160; upon the issuance of any shares of common stock pursuant to any present or future plan, sponsored by the corporation and generally open to participation by the corporation's securityholders, providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the corporation&#8217;s securities and/or the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of common stock;

&#160; &#160; (iv) &#160; for a change in the par value or no par value of common stock; or &#160; &#160; (v) &#160; for accrued and unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock. &#160; &#160; (e) &#160; whenever the conversion price is to be adjusted in accordance with section&#160;10(a), the corporation shall: (i)&#160;compute the conversion price in accordance with section&#160;10(a), taking into account the $0.01 threshold set forth in section&#160;10(b) hereof; (ii)&#160;as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the conversion price pursuant to&#160;section&#160;10(a), taking into account the $0.01 threshold set forth in section&#160;10(b) hereof (or if the corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), pro vide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the holders of the occurrence of such event;

exchange property &#8221;). &#160; &#160; (b) &#160; in the event that holders of the shares of common stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the holders are entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of the shares of common stock that affirmatively make an election. the amount of exchange property receivable upon conversion of any series b preferred stock in accordance with section 8 shall be determined based upon the conversion price in effect on the date of consummation of the reorganization event. &#160; &#160; (c) &#160; the above provisions of this section&#160;11 shall similarly apply to successive reorganization events and the provisions of section&#160;10 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the common stock in any such reorganization event. &#160;

&#160; exhibit a-16 &#160; &#160; &#160;herein shall prohibit the corporation from entering into or consummating a transaction constituting a fundamental change provided that the series b preferred stock is treated as set forth in the preceding sentence. &#160;
