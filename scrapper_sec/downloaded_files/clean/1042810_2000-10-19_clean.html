number of shares of common stock, $.01 par value (the "common stock"), of equity one, inc., a maryland corporation (the "corporation"), indicated in sections 1.2 and 1.3 hereof (the "shares") at the purchase price per share set forth in such sections. in addition, the corporation shall issue to the investor warrants to purchase such number of shares of the common stock as are set forth in section 1.4 hereof for the price and pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein (the "warrants"). 1.2 the investor shall purchase 1,000,000 shares at a price of $10.875 per share at the initial closing (the "initial closing"). the payment to be delivered at the time of the initial closing shall be made by the investor by wire transfer of $10,875,000 in accordance with instructions that are provided by the corporation not later than 24 hours before the initial closing (the "initial funding"). 1.3 the investor shall purchase and the corporation shall sell an additional 925,000 shares within 9 months after the initial closing. the corporation shall determine the time at which each additional closing shall take place and the number of shares to be sold; provided, however, that there shall be no more than three additional closings, with each additional closing covering no fewer than 200,000 shares (each, an "additional closing"). the corporation shall give not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of each additional closing. each additional closing shall take place not earlier than thirty (30) days and not later than fifty (50) days after the commencement of a calendar quarter and may not take place prior to the second business day following the corporation's release of its quarterly or annual financial results covering the immediately prior quarter. the price to be paid by the investor for each share sold at each additional closing shall be $10.875 per share, subject to adjustments set forth below. 1.4 the corporation agrees to issue to the investor warrants exercisable, as set forth herein, for 1,025,000 shares, pursuant to a warrant agreement of even date herewith. subject to the restrictions set forth herein relating to the times of exercise, warrants for 375,000 shares shall be exercisable through december 31, 2001 and warrants for 650,000 shares shall be exercisable through december 31, 2002. the exercise price shall be $10.875 per share, subject to adjustments set forth below. the warrants may be exercised, upon giving ten (10) business days advance written notice to the corporation, in whole or in part and from time to time, but only within a 30-50 day period following the end of each calendar quarter, provided that such exercise date is on or after the second business day following the corporation's release of its quarterly or annual financial results. a "business day" as used herein shall mean any day on which banks are open for business in the city of new york. 1.5 upon receipt by the corporation of the requisite payment for all shares to be purchased by the investor at the initial closing or any additional closing or upon investor's exercise of any warrants, as applicable, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein, the shares so purchased will be issued in the name of the investor, and the name of the investor will be registered on the stock transfer books of the corporation as the record owner of such shares. the corporation will issue to the investor a stock certificate for the shares purchased as of the date of the initial closing and any additional closing. 1.6 subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the investor hereby agrees to be bound hereby upon (i) execution and delivery to the corporation of the signature page to this subscription agreement and (ii) acceptance on the initial closing date (as hereafter defined) or an additional closing date (as hereafter defined), as the case may be, by the corporation of the investor's subscription (the "subscription"). 1.7 if the corporation shall issue or enter into any agreement to issue any shares of common stock (excluding shares issued in connection with a downreit or upreit transaction, a dividend reinvestment plan, or any existing or future incentive compensation programs, whether in the form of shares or options) for a net per share purchase price less than $10.625, then, as of the date of such subsequent sale (the "subsequent issuance"), the purchase price for any unpurchased shares and the exercise price for any unexercised warrants shall be reduced (but not increased) by an amount (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (a) the amount by which the net consideration per share for the subsequent issuance is less than $10.625 by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of new shares issued by the corporation in the subsequent issuance and the denominator of which is the number of unpurchased shares plus the number of unexercised warrants (the "subsequent issuance price adjustment"). to the extent that the corporation makes, from time to time, capital gain distributions, then, the purchase price of any unpurchased shares and/or the exercise price of any unexercised warrants, as of the date of the distribution, will also be adjusted downward by an amount, per share, on a fully diluted basis, so that the investor will receive the benefit of such distribution as though it had purchased the shares or exercised the warrants, but only to the extent that it does purchase the shares and exercise the warrants. 1.8 adjustment for recapitalization. in case (i) the outstanding shares of the common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares, (ii) a dividend or other distribution in common stock shall be paid in respect of common stock, (iii) the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares thereof, or (iv) any shares of the corporation's capital stock are issued by reclassification of the common stock (including any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation), the purchase price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination or reclassification or at the record date of such dividend or distribution shall simultaneously with -2- the effectiveness of such subdivision, combination or reclassification or immediately after the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be proportionately adjusted to equal the product obtained by multiplying the purchase price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted basis) prior to giving effect to such combination, subdivision, reclassification or dividend and the denominator of which is the number of outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted basis) after giving effect to such combination, subdivision, reclassification or dividend. for purposes hereof, "on a fully diluted basis" means that all outstanding options, rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of common stock and all securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock (such options, rights, warrants and securities are collectively referred to herein as "convertible securities") and all options or rights to acquire convertible securities have been exercised, converted or exchanged, and shall be calculated using the treasury stock method basis, whereby options and warrants will be included in the calculation of the number of outstanding shares of common stock only to the extent the average market price of the common stock over the preceding period of ten (10) business days exceeds the price of the options or warrants. whenever the per share is adjusted as provided in this section 1.8, the number of shares remaining to be purchased hereunder immediately prior to such purchase price adjustment shall be adjusted, effective simultaneous with the purchase price adjustment, either up or down, to equal the product obtained (calculated to the nearest full share) by multiplying such number of shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the purchase price per share in effect immediately prior to such purchase price adjustment and the denominator of which is the purchase price per share in effect upon such purchase price adjustment. the adjusted number of shares of common stock shall thereupon be the number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder until further adjusted as provided herein. 2.

registration rights. 5.1 investor represents and warrants that it is acquiring the shares and warrants for its own account and for the purpose of investment and not with a view to any distribution or resale thereof within the meaning of the act, and any applicable state or other securities laws ("state acts"). the investor further agrees that it will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares or the warrants, or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, in violation of the act or state acts and acknowledges that, in taking unregistered securities, it must continue to bear the economic risk of its investment for an indefinite period of time because of the fact that such shares and warrants, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, have not been registered under the act or state acts and further realizes that such shares or warrants, or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the act and state acts or an exemption from such registration is available. the investor further recognizes that the corporation is not assuming any obligation to register such shares or the warrants, or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, except as expressly set forth herein. the investor also acknowledges that appropriate legends reflecting the status of the shares and the common stock underlying the warrants under the act and state acts may be placed on the face of the certificates for such common stock at the time of their transfer and delivery to the holder thereof. 5.2 the shares and warrants issued pursuant to this agreement, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, may not be transferred except in a transaction which is in compliance with the act and state acts. except as provided hereafter with respect to registration of the shares and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, it shall be a condition to any such transfer that the corporation shall be furnished with an opinion of counsel to the holder thereof, reasonably satisfactory to the corporation, to the effect that the proposed transfer would be in compliance with the act and state acts. 5.3 after the passage of 24 months after the initial closing date, and upon receiving a demand therefor from the investor, the corporation shall use its best efforts to prepare and file with the sec, on up to three occasions, a registration statement and such other documents as may be necessary in the opinion of both counsel for the corporation and counsel for the investor, in order to comply with the provisions of the act so as to permit the registered resale of the shares, and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, for 18 consecutive months (each a "demand registration"). the corporation may postpone for up to six months the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement pursuant to a demand registration if the corporation notifies the investor that such demand registration would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any business plan of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries; provided that in such event, the investor will be entitled to withdraw such request and, if such request is -6- withdrawn, such demand registration will not count as one of the permitted demand registrations hereunder and the corporation shall pay all registration expenses in connection with such registration. in the event circumstances change and demand registration would no longer have an adverse effect on any business plan of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, the corporation shall within 30 days file with the sec a registration statement and such other documents as may be necessary in the opinion of both counsel for the corporation and counsel for the investor, in order to comply with the provisions of the act so as to permit the registered resale of the shares, and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. 5.4 (a) additionally, if at any time after 24 months after the initial closing date, the corporation proposes to register any of its common stock under the act for sale to the public, whether for its own account or for the account of other security holders or both (except with respect to registration statements on form s-4, s-8 or another form not available for registering the shares of common stock for sale to the public), each such time the corporation will give written notice to the investor of its intention to do so. upon the written request of the investor to register any of its shares, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, which notice must be received by the corporation within 15 business days after the corporation has given notice of the proposed registration to the investor, the corporation will use its best efforts to cause the common stock as to which registration shall have been so requested to be included in the securities to be covered by the registration statement proposed to be filed by the corporation, all to the extent required to permit the sale or other disposition by the investor (in accordance with such written request) of such shares of common stock so registered (a "piggy-back registration"). notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the corporation may elect, at any time, to register the shares or the common stock underlying the warrants, in which event the investor agrees to reasonably cooperate to facilitate such registration. (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 5.4, the corporation may withdraw any registration statement referred to in section 5.4 without thereby incurring any liability to the investor; provided, however, that to the extent such registration statement withdrawn by the corporation without a bona fide business reason, the corporation shall reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by the investor with respect to such registration statement. (c) in the event that any registration pursuant to this section 5.4 shall be, in whole or in part, an underwritten public offering, the number of shares of common stock of the investor and the other holders of the securities of the corporation requested to be included in such underwritten offering (the "requesting holders") may be reduced (pro-rata among the investor and the requesting holders based upon the number of securities held by the investor and the requesting holders) if and to the extent that the managing underwriter believes that such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by the corporation therein. the investor agrees to execute and deliver a customary lock-up agreement as may be requested by the managing underwriter; provided, however, that all requesting holders of similar securities in an amount equal to or greater than that held by investor shall have agreed to execute such agreements. -7- 5.5 the obligations of the corporation identified in this section 5 shall be suspended and tolled for such period of time (the "registration suspension period") as is necessary so that under no circumstances shall the registered resale of the shares, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, by the holders thereof commence within ninety days after the commencement of an underwritten primary public offering of the corporation's equity securities (a "public offering"). the investor acknowledges and agrees that during the registration suspension period it shall not resell the shares, or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. the investor further agrees that it shall, upon request, enter into an agreement with the underwriter of a public offering, pursuant to which the investor shall agree not to resell the shares, or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, during the registration suspension period. 5.6 if and whenever the corporation is required by the provisions of this agreement to use its best efforts to effect the registration of the shares, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, under the act for the account of an the investor, the corporation will, as promptly as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective; (b) prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec thereunder relating to the sale or other disposition of the securities covered by such registration statement; (c) furnish to the investor such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, complying with the requirements of the act, and such other documents as the investor may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the shares owned by the investor, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, but the investor shall not be entitled to use any selling materials other than a prospectus and such other materials as may be approved by the corporation, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; and (d) use its best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under the state acts as the investor shall reasonably request, and do any and all such other acts and things as may be necessary or advisable to enable the investor to consummate the public sale or other disposition of the shares owned by the investor, and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, in such states; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be obligated to register or qualify such securities in any jurisdiction in which such registration or qualification would require the corporation to qualify as a foreign corporation or file any general consent to service of process where it is not then so qualified or has not theretofore so consented. -8- 5.7 except as provided below in this section 5, the expenses incurred by the corporation in connection with action taken by the corporation to comply with this section 5, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing and delivery expenses, accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel to the corporation, consultant and expert fees, premiums for liability insurance, if the corporation chooses to obtain such insurance, obtained in connection with a registration statement filed to effect such compliance and all expenses, including counsel fees, of complying with state acts, shall be paid by the corporation. all fees and disbursements of any counsel, experts, or consultants employed by the investor shall be borne by the investor. the corporation shall not be obligated in any way in connection with any registration pursuant to this section 5 for any selling commissions or discounts payable by the investor to any underwriter or broker of securities to be sold by the investor. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of the corporation to take any action pursuant to this section 5 that the corporation shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the investor to pay all expenses required to be borne by the investor and to furnish or cause to be furnished to the corporation specifically for use in the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus written information concerning the securities held by the investor and also concerning any underwriter of such securities and the intended method of disposition thereof and any additional information or documentation as the corporation shall reasonably request and as may be required by administrators of the act or state acts in connection with the action to be taken by the corporation hereunder pursuant to such registration. 5.8 in the event of any registration under the act pursuant to this section 5, the corporation will indemnify and hold harmless the investor, its officers, directors and each underwriter of such securities, and any person who controls the investor or underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the act, against all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which any of such persons may become subject under the act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the investor, its officers, directors and each underwriter of such securities, and each such controlling person or entity for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by the investor, such underwriter, or such controlling person or entity in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, action, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the corporation will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in said registration statement, said preliminary prospectus or said prospectus, or said amendment of supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the corporation by the investor or such underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and provided further however, that the corporation will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or an alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus if (i) the investor failed to send or deliver a copy of the final prospectus or prospectus supplement with or prior to -9- the delivery of written confirmation of the sale of the common stock, and (ii) the final prospectus or prospectus supplement would have corrected such untrue statement or omission. 5.9 in the event of any registration of any securities under the act pursuant to this section 5, the investor will, or will furnish the written undertaking of such other person or entity as shall be acceptable to the corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the corporation, its officers, directors and any person who controls such corporation within the meaning of section 15 of the act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions, joint or several, to which the corporation, its officers, directors, or such controlling person or entity may become subject under the act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material

common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the corporation. the number of shares of common stock to be received upon the exercise of this warrant may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter set forth. the shares of common stock deliverable upon such exercise, and as adjusted from time to time, are hereinafter referred to as "warrant stock." the term "corporation" means and includes the

warrant, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this warrant, if mutilated, the corporation shall execute and deliver a new warrant of like tenor and date. any such new warrant executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of the corporation, whether or not this warrant so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall be at any time enforceable by anyone. the holder agrees with the corporation that this warrant is issued, and all the rights hereunder shall be held subject to, all of the conditions, limitations and provisions set forth herein. 1. exercise of warrant. this warrant may be exercised, upon giving ten (10) business days advance written notice to the corporation, with respect to a maximum of (i) 375,000 shares of common stock, in whole or in part, within any 30-50 day period following the end of a calendar quarter, provided that the desired exercise date is on or after the second business day following the corporation's release of its quarterly or annual financial results, during the period commencing on the date hereof and expiring 5:00 p.m. eastern time on december 31, 2001, and (ii) 650,000 shares of common stock in whole or in part, within any 30-50 day period following the end of a calendar quarter, provided that the desired exercise date is on or after the second business day following the corporation's release of its quarterly or annual financial results, during the period commencing on the date hereof and expiring 5:00 p.m. eastern time on december 31, 2002 (each of december 31, 2001 and december 31, 2002 shall be referred to herein as the "expiration date" with respect to the applicable warrant stock). the exercise price shall be $10.875 per share, subject to adjustments set forth below. a "business day" as used herein shall mean any day on which banks are open for business in the city of new york. this warrant shall be exercised by presentation and surrender of this warrant to the corporation at its principal office, or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the warrant exercise form attached hereto duly executed and accompanied by payment (by wire transfer in accordance with instructions provided by the corporation) of the exercise price for the number of shares specified in such form and instruments of transfer, if appropriate, duly executed by the holder or his or her duly authorized attorney. if this warrant should be exercised in part only, the corporation shall, upon surrender of this warrant for cancellation, execute and deliver a new warrant of like terms evidencing the rights of the holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder. upon receipt by the corporation of this warrant, together with the exercise price, at its office, or by the stock transfer agent of the corporation at its office, in proper form for exercise, the holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the corporation shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of common stock shall not then be actually delivered to the holder. the corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of common stock on exercise of this warrant. 2. adjustment of exercise price. if the corporation shall issue or enter into any agreement to issue any shares of common stock (excluding shares issued in connection with a -2- downreit or upreit transaction, a dividend reinvestment plan, or any existing or future incentive compensation programs, whether in the form of shares or options) for a net per share purchase price less than $10.625, then, as of the date of such subsequent sale (the "subsequent issuance"), the exercise price for any unexercised warrants shall be reduced (but not increased) by an amount (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (a) the amount by which the net consideration per share for the subsequent issuance is less than $10.625 by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of new shares issued by the corporation in the subsequent issuance and the denominator of which is the number of unpurchased shares (pursuant to the subscription agreement) plus the number of unexercised warrants (the "subsequent issuance price adjustment"). to the extent that the corporation makes, from time to time, capital gain distributions, then, the exercise price of any unexercised warrants, as of the date of the distribution, will also be adjusted downward by an amount, per share, on a fully diluted basis, so that the investor will receive the benefit of such distribution as though it had exercised the warrants, but only to the extent that it does exercise the warrants. 3. reservation of shares. the corporation will at all times reserve for issuance and delivery upon exercise of this warrant all shares of common stock of the corporation from time to time issuable upon exercise of this warrant. all such shares shall be duly authorized and, when issued upon such exercise, shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of all preemptive rights. 4. rights of the holder. the holder shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any rights of a shareholder in the corporation, either at law or in equity, and the rights of the holder are limited to those expressed in this warrant. the holder will be entitled to participate in the corporation's dividend reinvestment plan to the full extent of its unexercised warrants, to the extent they have not expired. with respect to the unexercised warrants, the holder will remit to the corporation sufficient funds to purchase the associated number of shares. the investor acknowledges and agrees that the corporation may, at any time and in its sole discretion, suspend its dividend reinvestment plan and that the dividend reinvestment plan has been so suspended by the corporation as of september 1, 2000. 5. anti-dilution provisions. 5.1 adjustment for recapitalization. in case (i) the outstanding shares of the common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares, (ii) a dividend or other distribution in common stock shall be paid in respect of common stock, (iii) the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares thereof, or (iv) any shares of the corporation's capital stock are issued by reclassification of the common stock (including any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation), the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision, combination or reclassification or at the record date of such dividend or distribution shall simultaneously with the effectiveness of such subdivision, combination or reclassification or immediately after the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be proportionately adjusted to equal the product obtained by multiplying the exercise price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted basis) prior to giving effect to such combination, subdivision, reclassification or dividend and the denominator of which is the number of outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted -3- basis) after giving effect to such combination, subdivision, reclassification or dividend. for purposes hereof, "on a fully diluted basis" means that all outstanding options, rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of common stock and all securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock (such options, rights, warrants and securities are collectively referred to herein as "convertible securities") and all options or rights to acquire convertible securities have been exercised, converted or exchanged, and shall be calculated using the treasury stock method basis, whereby options and warrants will be included in the calculation of the number of outstanding shares of common stock only to the extent the average market price of the common stock over the preceding period of ten (10) business days exceeds the price of the options or warrants. whenever the exercise price per share is adjusted as provided in this section 5.1, the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon conversion of the warrant immediately prior to such exercise price adjustment shall be adjusted, effective simultaneous with the exercise price adjustment, either up or down, to equal the product obtained (calculated to the nearest full share) by multiplying such number of shares of common stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the exercise price per share in effect immediately prior to such exercise price adjustment and the denominator of which is the exercise price per share in effect upon such exercise price adjustment, which adjusted number of shares of common stock shall thereupon be the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon conversion of the warrant until further adjusted as provided herein. 5.2 adjustment for reorganization, consolidation, merger, liquidation etc. in case of any reorganization of the corporation (or any other corporation, the securities of which are at the time receivable on the exercise of this warrant) after the date hereof or in case after such date the corporation (or any such other corporation) shall consolidate with or merge into another corporation or convey all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation or liquidate, then, and in each such case, the holder of this warrant upon the exercise thereof as provided in section 1 at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance or liquidation, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this warrant prior to such consummation, the securities or property to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder had exercised this warrant immediately prior thereto; in each such case, the terms of this warrant shall be applicable to the securities or property receivable upon the exercise of this warrant after such consummation. 5.3 no dilution. the corporation will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holder of this warrant against dilution or other impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, while this warrant is outstanding, the corporation (a) will not permit the par value, if any, of the shares of common stock receivable upon the exercise of this warrant to be above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise and (b) will take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the -4- corporation may validly and legally issue or sell fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock upon the exercise of this warrant. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, shares issued in connection with a downreit or upreit transaction, a dividend reinvestment plan, or any existing or future incentive compensation programs, whether in the form of shares or options, shall not be deemed a dilution in contravention of this provision. 5.4 certificate as to adjustments. in each case of an adjustment in the number of shares of warrant stock receivable on the exercise of this warrant, the corporation at its expense will promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this warrant and prepare a certificate executed by an executive officer of the corporation setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. the corporation will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the holder. 5.5 notices of record date, etc. in case: (a) the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend at the same rate as the rate of the last cash dividend theretofore paid) or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or (b) of any capital reorganization of the corporation, any reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation, any consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another corporation, or any conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to another corporation; or (c) of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation, then, and in each such case, the corporation shall mail or cause to be mailed to each holder of the warrant at the time outstanding a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place, and the time, if any, is to be fixed, as to which the holders of record of common stock (or such other securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of the warrant) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock (or such other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. such notice shall be mailed at least 15 business days prior to the date therein specified and the warrant may be exercised prior to said date during the term of the warrant, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 1 hereof, provided that the holder is not in possession of any material nonpublic information at such time. -5- 6. transfers. this warrant and the rights granted hereunder may not be assigned, sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed except to wholly owned subsidiaries or majority controlled affiliates of the holder. notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the warrant stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except as follows: (a) to a person who, in the opinion of counsel to the corporation, is a person to whom the warrant stock may legally be transferred without registration and without the delivery of a current prospectus under the

securities; or (b) to any person upon delivery of a prospectus then meeting the requirements of the securities act relating to such securities and the offering thereof for such sale or disposition,

(a) in the event the gazit-globe group intends to sell all of its stockholder shares in a bona fide arm's length transaction with a third party, other than an open-market transaction, at a price per share equal to or greater than $16.3125, subject to adjustment as set forth in the subscription agreement (the "proposed sale"), the gazit-globe group shall deliver 15 business days prior written notice thereof to investor. investor shall vote for, consent to and raise no objections to or contest such proposed sale. if the proposed sale is structured as a merger or consolidation, investor shall waive any dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with such merger or consolidation; if the proposed sale is structured as a sale of stock, upon the request of the gazit-globe group set forth in such notice, investor shall (a) agree to sell all of its stockholder shares and unexercised warrants subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 1(b) below, and (b) execute such purchase agreement and other documents as may reasonably be requested by the gazit-globe group. investor shall take such other necessary or desirable actions in connection with the consummation of the proposed sale as may be reasonably requested by the gazit-globe group. a "business day" as used herein shall mean any day on which banks are open for business in the city of new york. (b) the obligations of the investor with respect to the proposed sale are subject to the ownership at such time by the gazit-globe group of an aggregate ownership interest in the corporation equal to or greater than the ownership interest of the investor at such time and the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) upon the consummation of the proposed sale, investor shall receive for each of its investor shares being sold the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration as the gazit-globe group receives for each of their stockholder shares being sold and (ii) if the investor holds any unexpired and unexercised warrants, it shall be given an opportunity to either (a) exercise the warrants prior to the consummation of the proposed sale or (b) receive in exchange for such rights consideration equal to the amount determined by multiplying (1) the same amount of consideration per share received by holders of the common stock in connection with the proposed sale less the exercise price per share payable for the exercise of the warrants by (2) the number of shares of common stock to which investor is entitled upon exercise of such warrants. 2. tag-along rights. if any member (the "selling stockholder") of the gazit-globe group proposes to sell, other than pursuant to an open-market transaction or a de minimis transaction (involving less than 2% of the corporation's outstanding stock), any of its stockholder shares, it may only make such sale after complying with the provisions of this section 2. first, the selling stockholder shall give to the investor a notice (an "offer notice") allowing the investor to participate, on a pro-rata basis based upon the percentage of the stockholder shares of the gazit-globe group offered to be sold, upon the purchase by the proposed transferee of any shares of common stock owned by the selling stockholder and for the same per share consideration. the investor shall have the right, for a period of 10 business days after the offer notice is given, to accept such offer in whole or in part, exercisable by delivering a written notice to the selling stockholder within such 10 business day period, stating therein the number of shares of common stock (which may be the number of shares set forth in the offer notice or a portion thereof) to be sold by the investor to the proposed transferee. prior to the earlier of (x) the end of such 10 business day period or (y) the acceptance or rejection by the investor of the selling stockholder's offer, as the case may be, the selling stockholder shall not complete any sale of shares of common stock to the proposed transferee. thereafter, for a period of 120 days, the selling stockholder may sell to the proposed transferee for the consideration stated and on terms no more favorable to the proposed transferee than those set forth in the offer notice, shares of common stock stated in the offer notice as subject to purchase by the selling stockholder; provided that the proposed transferee, as the case may be, shall simultaneously purchase the number of shares of common stock as calculated above from the investor, to the extent the investor elected to participate in the sale. to the extent the number of shares of common stock proposed to be sold by the investor, if any, combined with the number proposed to be sold by the selling stockholder exceed the number of shares the proposed transferee is willing to purchase (the "maximum purchase amount"), then each of the investor and the selling stockholder shall be entitled to sell such number of shares of common stock as shall constitute such percentage of the maximum purchase amount corresponding to the percentage of shares, vis-a-vis one another, of investor -2- stock and stockholder shares held by the investor and the gazit-globe group, respectively. for the purposes of such calculation, any unexercised and unexpired warrants with an exercise price that is below the proposed offer price of the common stock, shall be deemed to be investor stock held by the investor. 3. board of directors.
