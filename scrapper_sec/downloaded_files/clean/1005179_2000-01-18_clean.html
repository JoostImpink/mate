(a), (b), (c) and (f). this statement on schedule 13d is being filed by wi-lan inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the province of alberta, canada ("wi-lan"). the principal business of wi-lan is in the high-speed wireless data communications industry, developing wireless technology and designing wireless access points, wireless ethernet bridges and wireless modems. the address of the principal business and principal offices of wi-lan is suite 300, 801 manning road n.e., calgary, alberta, t2e 8j8, canada. the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment (and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted) and the citizenship of each executive officer and director of wi-lan is set forth on schedule 1 hereto and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. (d) and (e). during the past five years, neither wi-lan nor, to the best knowledge of wi-lan, any individual otherwise identified in response to item 2, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 4 of 17 pages body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of which any such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to the convertible debenture purchase agreement, dated december 29, 1999 (the "convertible debenture purchase agreement"), between the company and wi-lan, the company agreed to (x) issue to wi-lan convertible debentures (the "first convertible debentures") in an aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000 and (y) grant to wi-lan an option to purchase convertible debentures issuable by the company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000 (the "convertible debenture option"). on january 7, 2000 (the "initial closing date"), the company issued to wi-lan first convertible debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $400,000 and granted to wi-lan the convertible debenture option. pursuant to the convertible debenture purchase agreement, additional first convertible debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $1,100,000 will be purchased by wi-lan at three separate closings (the "additional closings") which will occur on or prior to april 1, 2000. copies of the convertible debenture purchase agreement and the first convertible debenture are attached hereto as exhibits 1 and 2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. the form of the convertible debentures issued upon exercise of the convertible debenture option will be substantially similar to the form of the first cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 5 of 17 pages convertible debentures, except that the convertible debentures issued upon exercise of the convertible debenture option shall be convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price that will be an amount equal to the average weighted trading price of the shares of common stock over the last three trading days prior to the exercise of the convertible debenture option. in addition, under the convertible debenture option, wi-lan may elect to receive shares of common stock in lieu of convertible debentures upon the exercise thereof, with the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise to be determined by the average weighted trading price of the shares of common stock over the last three trading days prior to such exercise. the consideration paid by wi-lan for the first convertible debentures purchased by wi-lan on the initial closing date and the convertible debenture option consisted of $400,000 in cash, the source of which was the working capital of wi-lan. wi-lan anticipates that the source of the up to an aggregate of $2,600,000 in cash consideration that will be paid by wi-lan (i) at the additional closings in connection with the purchase of the additional first convertible debentures and (ii) in connection with the exercise of the convertible debenture option will be the working capital of wi-lan. pursuant to (i) the purchase agreement, dated december 29, 1999 (the "purchase agreement"), between finova mezzanine capital inc., a tennessee corporation ("finova"), and wi-lan and (ii) the option agreement, dated january 7, 2000 (the "option agreement"), between finova and wi-lan, on january 7, 2000 finova sold to wi-lan, among other things, (w) a convertible debenture issued by cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 6 of 17 pages the company and held by finova in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the "second convertible debenture"), (x) an option to acquire any or all of the 1,314,333 shares of series a convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "preferred stock"), of the company that are held by finova (the "preferred stock option") and (y) warrants held by finova exercisable into 702,615 shares of common stock of the company (the "dts warrants"). immediately upon acquisition by wi- lan of the second convertible debenture, wi-lan converted $1,310,000 in aggregate principal amount of the second convertible debenture into 1,310,000 shares of common stock. copies of the purchase agreement, the second convertible debenture, the option agreement, the certificate of designation of the preferred stock (the "certificate of designation") and the form of dts warrants are attached hereto as exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively, and are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. the consideration paid by wi-lan for the second convertible debenture, the preferred stock option and the dts warrants consisted of 87,320 newly issued common shares of wi-lan (the "wi-lan common shares"), which shares were delivered to an escrow account pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. under certain circumstances set forth in the purchase agreement, on the date the wi-lan common shares are released from the escrow account, based on the closing price of the wi-lan common shares on last trading day prior to the release of the wi-lan common shares from the escrow account, wi-lan could be required to pay additional consideration, in cash, to finova, or the number of wi-lan common shares paid to finova could be reduced, the amount of any such additional cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 7 of 17 pages consideration or reduction to be determined pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. wi-lan anticipates that the source of the cash consideration for the up to $1,314,333 payable upon exercise of the preferred stock option and any additional cash consideration payable as described in the preceding sentence will be the working capital of wi-lan. pursuant to the share purchase agreement, dated december 29, 1999 (the "share purchase agreement"), between wi-lan and microtel international, inc., a delaware corporation ("microtel"), on january 7, 2000 microtel sold to wi-lan 1,738,159 shares of common stock of the company. a copy of the share purchase agreement is attached as exhibit 8 hereto and is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. the consideration paid by wi-lan for the shares of common stock purchased from microtel consisted of $520,000 in cash and 28,340 newly issued wi-lan common shares. the source of the cash consideration paid by wi-lan to microtel was the working capital of wi-lan. item 4. purpose of transaction. wi-lan has purchased the first convertible debentures, the convertible debenture option, the second convertible debenture, the preferred stock option, the dts warrants and the shares of common stock to enable wi-lan to acquire such number of shares of common stock as would constitute a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company. pursuant to the terms of the convertible debenture purchase agreement, as of the initial closing date the majority of the board of directors of cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 8 of 17 pages the company was to be comprised of a majority of directors designated by wi-lan. as of the initial closing date, the board of directors was comprised of five members, three of which were designated by wi-lan and elected in connection with the initial closing of the transactions contemplated by the convertible debenture purchase agreement. each of the members of the board of directors of the company designated by wi-lan is an officer or director of wi-lan. as described in item 5 below, the voting power of the shares of common stock held by wi-lan (assuming full exercise or conversion of the exercisable or convertible securities described in this schedule 13d) would allow wi-lan to control any vote submitted to the shareholders of the company (or any written consent in lieu thereof) which requires the consent of a majority of holders of shares of common stock. the combined effect of the presence of the directors designated by wi-lan on the board of directors of the company and the voting power of wi-lan described in the preceding sentence may impede the acquisition of control of the company by another person. wi-lan has no current intention to sell any of its holdings of the shares of common stock or other securities it holds that are exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock. however, wi-lan intends to review its equity interest in the company on a continuing basis. depending on wi-lan's evaluation of the company's business, financial condition and prospects, and upon future developments (including, but not limited to, market prices of shares of common stock, availability and alternative uses of funds, as well as conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions), and other factors cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 9 of 17 pages and conditions wi-lan deems appropriate, wi-lan may acquire additional shares of common stock, dispose of the shares of common stock or the other securities it holds that are exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock, or formulate other purposes, plans or proposals regarding the company or any of its securities to the extent deemed advisable by wi-lan. except as described in the convertible debenture purchase agreement, the share purchase agreement, the purchase agreement, the first convertible debenture, the second convertible debenture, the option agreement, the certificate of designation or the dts warrants, and as otherwise set forth in this schedule 13d, neither wi-lan nor any individual otherwise identified in item 2 has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company, or the disposition of securities of the company; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or of any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (f) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the company's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 10 of 17 pages authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"); or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) through (c) as set forth above, on january 7, 2000, wi-lan acquired the first convertible debentures, the convertible debenture option, the second convertible debenture, the preferred stock option, the dts warrants and 3,048,159 shares of common stock of the company. assuming the purchase of all of the first convertible debentures, the first convertible debentures are convertible at any time into 1,500,000 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as described therein. assuming that wi-lan exercises its option to exercise the convertible debenture option for shares of common stock, as described in item 4, and assuming that the average weighted trading price of the shares of common stock for the last three trading days prior to the conversion thereof is $1.00, the convertible debenture option is exercisable at any time into 1,500,000 shares of common stock. the second convertible debenture is convertible at any time into 690,000 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as described therein. the preferred stock option is exercisable at any time into up to 1,314,333 shares of preferred stock, and such shares of preferred stock are convertible at any time into up to 1,314,333 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as described in the certificate of cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 11 of 17 pages designation. the dts warrants are exercisable at any time into 702,615 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as described therein. accordingly, as of january 7, 2000, wi-lan may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 8,755,107 shares of common stock, which, based on calculations made in accordance with rule 13d-3(d) promulgated under the exchange act of 1934, and there being 4,646,221 shares of common stock outstanding on december 29, 1999 as disclosed in the convertible debenture purchase agreement, represents approximately 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock on a diluted basis in accordance with rule 13d-3(d) promulgated under the exchange act. except as set forth above, neither wi-lan nor, to the best knowledge of wi-lan, any person identified on schedule 1, beneficially owns any shares of common stock or has effected any transaction in shares of common stock during the proceeding 60 days. paragraphs (d) and (e) of item 5 of schedule 13d are not applicable to this filing. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to the common stock of the issuer. the company and wi-lan are parties to the registration rights agreement, dated january 7, 2000 (the "registration rights agreement"), between the company and wi-lan, which gives wi-lan, among other things, the right, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to require the company to register for sale cusip no. 25387n 10 9 page 12 of 17 pages to the public any shares of common stock held by wi-lan, including the shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the first convertible debenture, the convertible debentures issued upon exercise of the convertible debenture option, the second convertible debenture and the dts warrants or upon conversion of the shares of preferred stock issued upon exercise of the preferred stock option. a copy of the registration rights agreement is attached as exhibit 9 hereto and is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. except as described elsewhere in this schedule 13d and as set forth in the convertible debenture purchase agreement, the first convertible debenture, the purchase agreement, the second convertible debenture, the option agreement, the certificate of designation, the dts warrants, the share purchase agreement and the registration rights agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as exhibits

(a) this debenture shall be convertible into shares of common stock at the conversion ratio at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, at any time. the holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the company a written notice (the "conversion notice"), accompanied by the certificate representing this debenture to be converted. each conversion notice shall specify the principal amount of this debenture to be converted and the date on which such conversion is to be effected (the "conversion date"), which shall in no event be earlier than the date such conversion notice is given in accordance with section 4.3(i) below. each conversion notice, once given, shall be irrevocable. if the holder is converting less than all this debenture held by such holder, the company shall promptly deliver to the holder a certificate for such number of this debenture as have not been converted. (b) within ten trading days after the conversion date, the company shall deliver to the holder (i) a certificate or certificates which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those then required by law), representing the number of shares of common stock being acquired upon the conversion of this debenture, and (ii) a certificate representing the number of this debenture not converted; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any this debenture, until certificates evidencing such this debenture are either delivered to the company or 14 any transfer agent for the common stock, or the holder notifies the company that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and provides a bond (or other adequate security acceptable to the company) satisfactory to the company to indemnify the company from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. (c) (i) the initial conversion price shall be $1.00 per share. (ii) if the company, at any time while any this debenture is outstanding, (a) shall pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on shares of its common stock payable in shares of its capital stock (whether payable in shares of its common stock or of capital stock of any class), (b) subdivide outstanding shares of common stock into larger number of shares, (c) combine outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, or (d) issue by reclassification of shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the company, the conversion price designated in section 4.3(c)(i) shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shires of common stock of the company outstanding before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding after such event. any adjustment made pursuant to this section 4.3(c)(ii) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (iii) if the company, at any time while any of this debenture is outstanding, shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the per share market value of common stock at the record date mentioned below, the conversion price designated in section 4.3(c)(i) shall be multiplied by a fraction, of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase and of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such per share market value. such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. however, upon the expiration of any right or warrant to purchase common stock the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to this section 4.3(c)(iii), if such right or warrant shall expire and shall not have been exercised, the conversion price shall immediately upon such expiration be recomputed and effective immediately upon such expiration be increased to the price which it would have been (but reflecting any other adjustments in the conversion price made pursuant to the provisions of this section 4.3 after the issuance of such rights or warrants) had the adjustment of the conversion price made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of offering for subscription 15 or purchase only that number of shares of common stock actually purchased upon the exercise of such rights or warrants actually exercised. (iv) if the company, at any time while any this debenture is outstanding, shall issue (a) options or warrants entitling the holder to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price less than the conversion price, or (b) securities convertible into common stock at a conversion price less than the conversion price, then the conversion price designated in section 4.3(c)(i) shall be automatically reset to such lower conversion price, provided that the adjustment provided by this section 4.3(c)(iv) shall not apply to issuance of securities pursuant to options, warrants, or conversion rights outstanding on the closing date, and further, shall not be applicable until the company shall have issued options, warrants, or convertible securities, exercisable or convertible into 400,000 shares of common stock at an exercise or conversion price less than the conversion price, provided that such exercise or conversion price is equal to or greater than the per share market value on the date of issuance. such adjustment shall be made whenever such options, warrants or convertible securities are issued at an exercise or conversion price less than the conversion price, and such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date on which such options, warrants or convertible securities are issued at an exercise or conversion price less than the conversion price. (v) in case the company, at any time while this debenture is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of common stock (and not to holders of this debenture) evidences of its indebtedness, or assets or rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase any security (excluding those referred to in section 4.3(c)(iii) above) then in each such case the conversion price at which this debenture shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the per share market value of common stock determined as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such per share market value of the common stock on such record date less the then fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of common stock as determined by the board of directors of the company in good faith; provided, however, that in the event of a distribution exceeding ten percent of the net assets of the company, then such fair market value shall be determined by a nationally recognized or major regional investment banking firm or firm of independent certified public accountants of recognized standing (which may be the firm that regularly examines the financial statements of the company) (an "appraiser") selected in good faith by the holders of a majority in interest of this debenture and provided, further, that the company, after receipt of the determination by such appraiser shall have the right to select an additional appraiser, in which case the fair market value shall be equal to the average of the determination by each such appraiser. in either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement provided to all holders of this debenture of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one 16 share of common stock. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above. (vi) all calculations tinder this section 4.3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. (vii) whenever the conversion price is adjusted pursuant to section 4.3(c)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), the company shall promptly mail to each holder of this debenture, a notice setting forth the conversion price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. (viii) in case of any reclassification of the common stock, any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another person, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which share exchange the common stock is converted into other securities, cash or property, then the holders of this debenture then outstanding shall have the right thereafter to convert such this debenture only into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon or decreed to be held following such reclasification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange by a holder of a number of shares of the common stock of the company into which such this debenture could have been converted immediately prior to such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. the terms of any such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange shall include such terms so as to continue to give to the holder of shares of this debenture the right to receive the securities or property set forth in this section 7.3(c)(viii) upon any conversion following such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. this provision shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers of share exchanges.

(d) holdback arrangements. in connection with a requested underwritten offering, the holders shall agree to customary holdback arrangements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters of such offering. 2.6 preparation; reasonable investigation. in connection with the preparation and filing of each registration statement under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, the company will give the holders of registrable 11 securities registered under such registration statement, their underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel the opportunity to participate in the preparation of such registration statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the commission, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and will give each of them such reasonable access to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the business of the company with its officers and the independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such holders' and such underwriters' respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the securities act. 2.7 limitations, conditions and qualifications to obligations under registration covenants. the company shall be entitled to postpone, for a reasonable period of time (but not exceeding 100 days), the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to section 2.1 if the company determines, in its good faith judgment, that such registration and offering would interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the company or any of its affiliates and promptly gives the holders of registrable securities requesting registration thereof pursuant to section 2.1 written notice of such determination, containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay. if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, holders of registrable securities requesting registration thereof pursuant to section 2.1, representing not less than 33-1/3% of the registrable securities with respect to which registration has been requested and constituting not less than 66-2/3% of the initiating holders, shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the company within 30 days after receipt of the notice of postponement and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of the requests for registration to which holders of registrable securities are entitled pursuant to section 2.1 hereof. 2.8 indemnification. (a) indemnification by the company. the company will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, in the case of any registration statement filed pursuant to section 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3, each seller of any registrable securities covered by such registration statement and each other person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, and their respective directors, officers, partners, members, agents and affiliates against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such seller or underwriter or any such director, officer, partner, member, agent, affiliate or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal counsel (including those incurred in connection with any claim for indemnity hereunder), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, 12 whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and the company will reimburse such seller or underwriter and each such director, officer, partner, member, agent, affiliate and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and provided further, that the company shall not be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of registrable securi ties or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such person's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may have been supplemented or amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of registrable securities to such person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director, officer, partner, member, agent or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. (b) indemnification by the sellers. as a condition to including any registrable securities in any registration statement, the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such registrable securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 2.8(a)) the company, and each director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other person who controls the company or any such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged 13 omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the liability of such indemnifying party under this section 2.8(b) shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in section 2.8(a) or (b), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.8, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action or proceeding in which both the company and an indemnified party is, or is reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the company's expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, (a) there are or may be legal defenses available to such indemnified party or to other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the company or (b) any conflict or potential conflict exists between the company and such indemnified party that would make such separate representation advisable; provided, however, that in no event shall the company be required to pay fees and expenses under this section 2.8 for more than one firm of attorneys in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal actions. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires action other than the payment of money by the indemnifying party. 14 (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 2.8 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified party under section 2.8(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under section 2.8(a) or (b), the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under section 2.8(a) or (b) shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same, including those incurred in connection with any claim for indemnity hereunder), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company and the prospective sellers of registrable securities covered by the registration statement which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and such prospective sellers from the offering of the securities covered by such registration statement; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (ii), the relative benefits received by the prospective sellers shall be deemed not to exceed the amount of proceeds received by such prospective sellers. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. such prospective sellers' obligations to contribute as provided in this section 2.8(d) are several in proportion to the relative value of their respective registrable securities covered by such registration statement and not joint. in addition, no person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (e) other indemnification. indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.8 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each seller of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority other than the securities act. (f) indemnification payments. the indemnification and contribution required by this section 2.8 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. 3. definitions. as used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms have the following respective meanings: 15 "commission" means the securities and exchange commission or any other federal agency at the time administering the securities act.
