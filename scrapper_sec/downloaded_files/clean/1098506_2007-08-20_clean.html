right nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right. 13.4 set-off in addition to any rights now or hereafter

knowledge or has been notified by a borrower of such fact or has been notified by a lender that such lender considers that a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, such notification to specify in detail the nature thereof. -85- 14.7 action by administrative agent the administrative agent shall be entitled to use its discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any rights which may be vested in it on behalf of the lenders by and under this agreement; provided, however, that the administrative agent shall not exercise any rights under section

action taken or failure to act pursuant to such instructions shall be binding on all lenders. in respect of any notice by or action taken by the administrative agent hereunder, the borrowers shall at no time be obliged to enquire as to the right or authority of the administrative agent to so notify or act. 14.8 notice of events of default in the event that the administrative agent shall acquire actual knowledge or shall have been notified of any default or event of default, the administrative agent shall promptly notify the lenders and shall take such action and assert such rights under section 13.1 of this agreement and under the other credit documents as the majority lenders shall request in writing and the administrative agent shall not be subject to any liability by reason of its acting pursuant to any such request. if the majority lenders shall fail for five banking days after receipt of the notice of any default or event of default to request the administrative agent to take such action or to assert such rights under any of the credit documents in respect of such default or event of default, the administrative agent may, but shall not be required to, and subject to subsequent specific instructions from the majority lenders, take such action or assert such rights (other than rights under section 13.1 of thi s agreement or under the other credit documents and other than giving an express waiver of any default or any event of default) as it deems in its discretion to be advisable for the protection of the lenders except that, if the majority lenders have

such amendment is executed or such consent or waiver is given before or after such failure), shall not be construed as a breach of such covenant, condition or obligation or as a default or event of default.

(d) if lenders with individual commitments that in the aggregate are equal to or greater than 70% but less than 100% of the aggregate individual commitments of all lenders approve the unanimous lender request within the unanimous lender response period (the &#147;

(c) for greater certainty, the lenders acknowledge and agree that without limiting the generality of the provisions of section 14.16(a) and (b), such provisions will have application if and whenever any lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, compensation, or otherwise) on account of any monies owing or payable by the borrowers to it under the credit documents in excess of its pro rata share of payments on account of monies owing by the borrowers to all the finance parties thereunder.
