recapitalization &#148;) in connection with the ipo.&#160; these transactions established ibg holdings as the holding company for the interests of the former members of ibg llc. other than the anticipated decrease over time in the percentage voting power in the company held by ibg holdings as described in greater detail under &#147;item 6&#151;contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to the securities of the issuer,&#148; as of the date of this statement, the reporting persons do not, have, any present plan or proposals which would relate to or would result in any transaction event or action enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5.&#160;

(c) there were no transactions in the class a common stock by the reporting persons during the last sixty days, other than the transactions described under &#147;item 6&#151;contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to the securities of the issuer.&#148; (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer voting pursuant to the restated charter, ibg holdings, as the sole holder of the 100 outstanding shares of the class b common stock, is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of ibg llc membership interests held by it at any given time. except as otherwise provided by law and the restated charter, the company&#146;s shares of class a common stock and class b common stock vote together as a single class.&#160; as of the date of this statement, ibg holdings 5 holds 360,000,000 ibg llc membership interests, and, as a result, the class b common stock held by ibg holdings represents approximately 90.0% of the voting power of the company.&#160; such percentage voting power is anticipated to decrease over time as a result of the exchange and redemption transactions described below.&#160; mr. thomas peterffy, through his ownership of the voting membership interests in ibg holdings, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of the class b common stock and accordingly holds approximately 90.0% of the voting power of the company.&#160; as set forth in the limited liability company operating agreement of ibg holdings, dated as of may 3, 2007 (the &#147; ibg holdings llc agreement &#148;), if at any time in the future thomas peterffy and his affiliates own less than a majority of the membership interests in ibg holdings, then at such time all membership interests in ibg holdings will become voting membership interests. accordingly, all members of ibg holdings, instead of mr. peterffy alone, would together direct the voting of the shares of class b common stock, and all such members would together exercise control over all matters requiring the approval of the company&#146;s stockholders. however, even if mr. peterffy and his affiliates cease to own a majority of the membership interests in ibg holdings, mr. peterffy could, depending on his level of percentage ownership, continue to effectively control or significantly influence matters requiring the approval of the company&#146;s stockholders. exchange and redemption of ibg holdings membership interests in connection with the recapitalization, the members of ibg llc immediately prior to the ipo received membership interests in ibg holdings. the membership interests in ibg holdings will not be directly exchangeable for shares of class a common stock. instead, the membership interests will become redeemable at various times over the next eight years following the ipo at the option of the holder. the redemption price for the membership interests will depend on the manner in which the payment is made to ibg holdings. on an annual basis, each holder of an ibg holdings membership interest may request that the liquefiable portion (determined in accordance with the schedule set forth below) of its interest be redeemed by ibg holdings. the primary manner in which the redemption price will be paid is by selling a similar number of shares of class a common stock to the public and using the gross proceeds from such sales, less underwriting discounts or placement agency fees, to acquire ibg llc membership interests from ibg holdings. the company has reserved for issuance 360.0 million shares of class a common stock, which is the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock expected to be issuable over time through such sales, assuming no anti-dilution adjustments based on combinations or divisions of class a common stock. the company would then expect ibg holdings to use the net proceeds it receives from such sales to redeem an identical number of ibg holdings membership interests from the requesting holders. in some cases, ibg llc may redeem ibg llc membership interests from ibg holdings using cash on hand. the primary circumstance under which ibg llc would use cash on hand would be if ibg llc had, at a given point in time, a relative surplus of cash on hand and the company&#146;s board of directors were to determine that using cash on hand to effect redemptions of ibg llc membership interests would be an optimal use of such funds in relation 6 to alternative uses. the redemption price per membership interest would be equal to the 30-day average closing price of the class a common stock. in connection with the ipo, the holders of the ibg holdings membership interests have agreed to a schedule for redemptions which would allow the holders to liquefy their investment in ibg holdings, which is as follows (all dates are approximate and subject to the prior or concurrent registration of the corresponding shares of class a common stock and sale of such shares into the public markets in order to pay the redemption price of the ibg holdings membership interests, if this financing alternative is utilized): &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 10.0% of the ibg holdings membership interests on the date of the ipo; &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; an additional 12.5% of the ibg holdings membership interests on each of the first seven anniversaries of the ipo; and &#183; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
