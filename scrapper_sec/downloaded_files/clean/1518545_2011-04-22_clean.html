other developments concerning vimpelcom and its businesses generally; other business opportunities available to the reporting persons; changes in law and government regulations; general economic conditions; and financial and stock market conditions, including the market price of the common shares. &#160; 16 &#160; item 5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

provided, however, that failure to so notify the indemnitor shall not relieve the indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of the claim, except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by such failure. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if an indemnitee shall receive notice of any claim or proceeding initiated by a third party which is or may be subject to indemnification (other than any claim or proceeding related to taxes) (each, a &#8220;

&#160; 10 &#160; (b) &#160; to the extent permitted by law, each holder will, if registrable securities held by such holder are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify the company, each of its directors and officers, each underwriter, if any, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the company or such underwriter (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act), and any other person participating in such registration, each of its officers and directors and each person controlling (within the meaning of section&#160;15 of the securities act) such person participating in such registration, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse or pay for the account of the company, such persons, such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred (as and when incurred) in connection with investigating, preparing the defense of or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company in writing by such holder and stated to be specifically for use therein; provided , however , that the liability of such holder for indemnification under this section 5.1(b) shall not exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such holder. &#160; (c) &#160; each party entitled to indemnification under this section 5.1 (the " indemnified party ") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the " indemnifying party ") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such indemnified party's expense; provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this agreement except to the extent that the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. &#160; (d) &#160; the obligations of the company and each holder under this section 5.1 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement pursuant to this agreement. &#160; (e) &#160; if a claim for indemnification under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b) is available by its terms but is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then each indemnifying party in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any such claim, loss, liability or action that otherwise would have been indemnified under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b), as the case may be, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or inactions that resulted in such claim, loss, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party, any action or inaction by any such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, omission, action or inaction; provided , however , that the liability of any holder under this section 5.1(e) shall be limited to the amount of net proceeds received by such holder in the offering giving rise to such liability, less any amounts paid pursuant to section 5.1(b).&#160;&#160;the amount of such claim, loss, liability or action subject to this section 5.1(e) shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, liability or action (which shall be limited as provided in section 5.1(c) if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing in this section 5.1(e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section&#160;11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.&#160;&#160;promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of written notice of the commencement or threatened commencement of any claims for which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this section 5.1(e) and if a notice for indemnification has not been otherwise given under this section 5.1, such indemnified party shall give written notice thereof in the manner set forth hereunder for a claim for indemnification to the indemnifying party; provided , however , that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any obligation to provide contribution hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party's ability to defend such action is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such timely notice.&#160;&#160;the parties acknowledge that determining contribution pursuant to this section 5.1(e) by &#160; pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 5.1(e) would not be just or equitable.&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt, if indemnification is available under section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b), the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the fullest extent provided in section 5.1(a) or section 5.1(b) without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this section 5.1(e). &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; article vi &#160; information available &#160; the company, upon the reasonable request of each holder, shall make available for inspection by each holder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the registration statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by each holder or any such underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the company, and cause the company&#8217;s officers, employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by each holder or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the registration statement. &#160; article vii &#160; assignment of registration rights &#160; section 7.1 &#160; assignment .&#160;&#160;neither this agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party and any attempt to do so will be void, except in connection with assignments and transfers of the registrable securities to qualifying transferees, but only if the qualifying transferee signs and delivers to the company a written acknowledgment (in for and substance satisfactory to the company) that is has joined with the holder and the other qualifying transferees as a party to this agreement and has assumed, severally but not jointly, the rights and obligations of the holder hereunder with respect to the registrable securities transferred by the holder.&#160;&#160;this agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties and their successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of each holder.&#160;&#160;nothing in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this agreement, except as provided in this agreement. &#160; section 7.2 &#160; obligations several and not joint .&#160;&#160;the obligations of the holders hereunder shall be several (and not joint).&#160;&#160;a holder shall not be responsible for the failure of any other holders to perform any obligation required to be performed by it hereunder.&#160;&#160;the obligations of the company at any time hereunder to each holders shall be separate and independent obligations.&#160;&#160;each holder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this agreement as it shall see fit, and it shall not be necessary for any other holders to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. &#160; article viii &#160; miscellaneous &#160; section 8.1 &#160; effectiveness; termination; survival .&#160;&#160;this agreement shall take effect on the closing date and shall terminate on the date on which all parties agree in writing to the termination of this agreement.&#160;&#160;any termination of this agreement pursuant to this section 8.1 shall be without prejudice to the rights, obligations or liabilities of any party which shall have accrued or arisen prior to such termination.&#160;&#160;the provisions of article i and article viii shall survive the termination of this agreement. &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; section 8.2 &#160; holders .&#160;&#160;a person is deemed to be a holder of registrable securities whenever such person owns or is deemed to own of record such registrable securities.&#160;&#160;if the company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more persons with respect to the same registrable securities, the company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from such record owner of such registrable securities. &#160; section 8.3 &#160; notices .&#160;&#160;any notice, request, consent, waiver or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be effective only if it is in writing and personally delivered or sent by facsimile or sent, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by recognized overnight courier service, postage or other charges prepaid, and shall be deemed given when so delivered by hand or facsimile, or when received if sent by mail or by courier, as follows: &#160;
