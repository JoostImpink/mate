(a)	in the event of a registration of eligible securities under the securities act pursuant to sections 2.1 and 2.2, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each selling holder, its affiliates, each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, each underwriter of such eligible securities and each other person, if any, who controls such selling holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such selling holder, affiliate, their respective officer, director, employee, agent, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise or in any action in respect thereof, and will reimburse each such person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such eligible securities were registered under the securities act pursuant to sections 2.1 or 2.2, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable to any such selling holder, affiliate, officer, director, employee, agent, underwriter or controlling person in any such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in conformity with information furnished by such selling holder, affiliate officer, director, employee, agent, underwriter or controlling person in writing specifically for use in such registration statement or prospectus. (b)	each selling holder of such eligible securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the company or any underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, each officer of the company who signs the registration statement, each director of the company, each other seller of securities registered by the registration statement covering such eligible securities and each person, if any, who controls such seller, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the company or any such officer, director, underwriter, other seller or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, and shall reimburse the company and each such officer, director, underwriter, other seller and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein made in reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining to such holder furnished in writing to the company by such holder specifically for use in the registration statement or prospectus relating to such eligible securities. notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the aggregate liability of each such holder hereunder shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of eligible securities covered by such registration statement. (c)	promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party hereunder, shall notify such indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this section 2.5 and, unless the failure to so provide notice materially adversely affects or prejudices such indemnifying party's defense against any action, shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under this section 2.5. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from such indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 2.5 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume and undertake the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such defense to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. (d)	no indemnifying party shall be liable for any amounts paid in a settlement effected without the consent of such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. no indemnifying party shall, without the indemnified party's prior written consent, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the plaintiff to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. (e)	the reimbursements required by this section 2.5 shall be made by periodic payment during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received and expenses incurred. (f)	the indemnification provided for under this agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, employee, agent, or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. 2.6	contribution. if for any reason the indemnity set forth in section 2.5 is unavailable or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity (a) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified party on the other hand (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the actual or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or actual or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission) or (b) if the allocation provided by section 2.6(a) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to such indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault of the indemnifying party and such indemnified party but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified party on the other hand, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 2.6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable consideration referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in such paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 2.6, a holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds of the sale of eligible securities sold by such holder and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person that is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 2.7	underwriting agreement. if eligible securities are to be sold pursuant to a registration statement in an underwritten offering pursuant to sections 2.1 or 2.2, the company and each selling holder of eligible securities shall enter into a written agreement with the managing underwriter or underwriters selected in the manner herein provided in such form and containing such provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to the company and each such selling holder and as are customary in the securities business for such an arrangement among such underwriter or underwriters, each such selling holder and companies of the company's size and investment stature. no holder of eligible securities may participate in any underwritten sale of eligible securities pursuant to sections 2.1 or 2.2 hereof unless such holder agrees to sell such holder's securities in accordance with any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to specify the method of distribution of the securities being registered and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of eligible securities shall be required to make any representations and warranties to the company or the underwriters other than representations or warranties regarding the identity of such holder, such holder's eligible securities, such holder's ability to transfer title to such holder's eligible securities and such holder's intended method of distribution or any other representations required by applicable law. 2.8	limitations on subsequent registration rights. if, subsequent to the date hereof, the company grants to any holders or prospective holders of the company's securities the right to require that the company register any securities of the company under the securities act, such registration rights shall be granted subject to the rights of the holders to include all or part of their eligible securities in any such registration on the terms and conditions set forth in section 2.2. 2.9	reports under securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit the holders to sell securities of the company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on form s-3, the company agrees to: (a)	make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144, at all times so long as the company remains subject to the periodic reporting

enable the holders to use form s-3 for the sale of its eligible securities; (c)	file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents as may be required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and (d)	furnish to each holder, so long as such holder owns any eligible securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of rule 144, the securities act and the exchange act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to form s-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company and such other reports and documents so filed by the company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any holder of any rule or regulation of the sec which permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form. 2.10	market-standoff agreement. (a)	market-standoff period; agreement. if requested by the company and the managing underwriter of common stock of the company, each holder agrees not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the company (other than those included in the registration) without the prior written consent of such underwriter, for such period of time (not to exceed 180 days) from the effective date of a registration statement filed under the act as may be requested by such underwriter and to execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by such underwriter at the time of the company's underwritten public offering; provided that such agreement shall only apply to the first such registration statement of the company including securities to be sold on its behalf to the public after the date hereof. (b)	limitations. the obligations described in section 2.10(a) shall apply only if all officers and directors of the company and all significant equity holders of the company enter into similar agreements, and shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, or to a registration relating solely to a transaction pursuant to rule 145 under the act. if any person, including any officer or director of the company and any equity holder of the company, is released from its obligations under section 2.10(a) or such similar arrangements, all holders shall be released from such obligations. 2.11	subsequent public offering. at any time following the closing, upon request of holders holding a majority of the eligible securities, the company shall use its best efforts to conduct a firmly underwritten primary registered public offering of its common stock as promptly as practical following the receipt of such notice, if, in the opinion of a major investment banking firm selected by holders holding a majority of the eligible securities, the public equity markets would be receptive to such an offering. article iii participation rights 3.1	right of first offer. subject to the terms and conditions specified in this section 3.1, the company hereby grants to each investor a right of first offer with respect to future sales by the company of its shares (as hereinafter defined). each time the company proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its capital stock ("shares"), the company shall first make an offering of such shares to each investor in accordance with the following provisions: (a)	the company shall deliver a notice by registered or certified mail ("notice") to the investors stating (i) its bona fide intention to offer such shares, (ii) the number of such shares to be offered and (iii) the price and terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such shares.

delaware corporation (the "company"), one fully paid, duly authorized and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "common stock"), of the company at any time or from time to time on or before 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on the warrant expiration date, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth herein (the "exercise price"), all on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth. the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each warrant (the "number issuable") shall be determined for each warrant by dividing $1.00 by the exercise price in effect at the time of such exercise, and is initially one (1) share of common stock. capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given them in section 13 hereof or, if not therein defined, in the securities purchase agreement (as defined herein). section 1.	exercise of warrants. subject to the last paragraph of this section 1, the warrants evidenced hereby may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the registered holder hereof at any time or from time to time on or before 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on the warrant expiration date, upon delivery to the company at the principal executive office of the company in the united states of america, of (a) this warrant certificate, (b) a written notice stating that such holder elects to exercise the warrants evidenced hereby in accordance with the provisions of this section 1 and specifying the number of warrants being exercised and the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued and (c) payment of the exercise price for the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, which shall be payable by any one or any combination of the following: (i) cash, (ii) certified or official bank check payable to the order of the company, (iii) by the surrender (which surrender shall be evidenced by cancellation of the relevant number of warrants represented by any warrant certificate presented in connection with a cashless exercise (as defined below)) of a warrant or warrants (represented by one or more relevant warrant certificates), and without the payment of the exercise price in cash, in return for the delivery to the surrendering holder of such number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock for which such warrant is exercised as of the date of exercise (if the exercise price were being paid in cash) reduced by that number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares for which such warrant is exercised multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is (a) the exercise price and the denominator of which is (b) the market price of one share of common stock on the business day that immediately precedes the day of exercise of the warrant or (iv) by the delivery of shares of common stock that are valued at the market price on the business day immediately preceding the day of the exercise of the warrant that are either held by the holder or are acquired in connection with such exercise, and without payment of the exercise price in cash. any share of common stock delivered as payment of the exercise price in connection with an in-kind exercise (as defined below) shall be deemed to have a value equal to the market price of one share of common stock on the business day that immediately precedes the day of exercise of the warrant. an exercise of a warrant in accordance with clause (iii) is herein referred to as a "cashless exercise" and an exercise of a warrant in accordance with clause (iv) is herein referred to as an "in-kind exercise." the documentation and consideration, if any, delivered in accordance with clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph above are collectively referred to herein as the "warrant exercise documentation." for the purposes of this section 1, market price shall be calculated without reference to the last sentence of the definition thereof. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within two (2) business days after receipt of the warrant exercise documentation, the company shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock issuable in connection with such exercise, and if less than the full number of warrants evidenced hereby are being exercised, a new warrant certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of warrants evidenced by this warrant certificate, less the number of warrants then being exercised or surrendered; provided, however, that no new warrant certificate need be delivered if the warrant expiration date has occurred. such exercise shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of delivery of the warrant exercise documentation so that the person entitled to receive shares of common stock upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of common stock at such time. the company shall pay all expenses in connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges (other than income taxes of the holder) that may be imposed in respect of the issue or delivery of any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants evidenced hereby. the company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any certificate for shares of common stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the warrants evidenced hereby. in connection with the exercise of any warrants evidenced hereby, at the company's option, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the company may elect to pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to any such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of common stock on the business day that precedes the day of exercise. if more than one such warrant shall be exercised by the holder thereof at the same time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the total number of warrants so exercised. section 2.	adjustments . the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this section 2. (a)	adjustment of exercise price upon issuance of common stock. if after november 29, 2001 (the "issue date") the company shall issue or sell any shares of its common stock (except upon exercise of the warrants and shares issued as a result of adjustments made under the terms of the warrants) for a price per share less than (including, without limitation, those circumstances described in paragraphs (i) through (vii) below), the exercise price in effect on the date immediately prior to the date of such issue or sale, then, immediately upon such issue or sale, the exercise price then in effect shall be reduced to such lower price per share. (i)	issuance of rights or options. in case at any time after the issue date the company shall in any manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise), any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, common stock or any stock, notes or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock (such convertible or exchangeable stock, notes or securities being herein called "convertible securities"), whether or not such rights, options or warrants or the right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, such grant shall be deemed a sale by the company of its common stock and the price per share for such deemed sale of common stock shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount, if any, in cash or in property received or receivable by the company as consideration for the granting of such rights, options or warrants, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, plus, in the case of such rights, options or warrants that relate to convertible securities, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such convertible securities and upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities issuable upon the exercise of such rights, options or warrants. except as provided in section 2(a)(iii), no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. (ii)	issuance of convertible securities. in case at any time after the issue date the company shall in any manner issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) or sell any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, such issuance or sale of convertible securities shall be deemed a sale by the company of its common stock and the price per share for such common stock shall be determined by dividing (a) the total amount received or receivable in cash or in property by the company as consideration for the issue or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (b) the total maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities; provided, however, that (i) except as otherwise provided in section 2(a)(iii), no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, and (ii) if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any option to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the exercise price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 2(a), no further adjustment of the exercise price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. (iii)	change in option price or exercise price. if the purchase price provided for in any right or option referred to in section 2(a)(i), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities referred to in section 2(a)(i) or 2(a)(ii), or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in section 2(a)(i) or 2(a)(ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock shall change (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution), the exercise price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be readjusted (increased or decreased, as the case may be) to the exercise price that would have been in effect at such time had such rights, options or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. no readjustment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall have the effect of increasing the exercise price by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment thereof originally made in respect of the issue, sale, grant or assumption of rights, options or convertible securities. on the expiration of any such option or right referred to in section 2(a)(i) or the termination of any such right to convert or exchange any such convertible securities referred to in section 2(a)(i) or 2(a)(ii), the exercise price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be readjusted (increased or decreased, as the case may be) to the exercise price that would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such right, option or convertible securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been granted, issued or sold. if the purchase price provided for in any such right or option referred to in section 2(a)(i) or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in section 2(a)(ii) are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock shall be reduced at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then in case of the delivery of shares of common stock upon the exercise of any such right or option or upon conversion or exchange of any such convertible securities, the exercise price then in effect hereunder shall, if not already adjusted, forthwith be adjusted to such amount as would have obtained had such right, option or convertible securities never been issued as to such shares of common stock and had adjustments been made upon the issuance of the shares of common stock delivered as aforesaid, but only if as a result of such adjustment the exercise price then in effect hereunder is thereby reduced. (iv)	consideration for stock. anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in case at any time any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase any such common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the company therefor, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or allowed by the company in connection therewith. in case at any time any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase any such shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, in whole or in part, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined reasonably and in good faith by the board of directors of the company, without deduction of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid or allowed by the company in connection therewith. in case at any time any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to purchase such shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the company is the surviving company, the amount of consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value as determined reasonably and in good faith by the board of directors of the company of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving corporation as the board may determine to be attributable to such shares of common stock, convertible securities, rights or options, as the case may be. in case at any time any rights or options to purchase any shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with the issue and sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integral transaction in which no consideration is allocated to such rights or options by the parties thereto, such rights or options shall be deemed to have been issued for an amount of consideration equal to the fair value thereof as determined reasonably and in good faith by the board of directors of the company. (v)	record date. in case the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold as a result of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase. (vi)	adjustment to determination of exercise price. when making the calculations and determinations described in this section 2(a), there shall not be taken into account (a) the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options or warrants outstanding on the issue date, (b) the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock of the company, (c) the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the warrants evidenced by this warrant certificate, (d) the issuance of series a preferred stock upon exercise of the series a preferred stock warrants (as defined in the securities purchase agreement dated as of november 29, 2001) issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement agreement and (e) the issuance of 20,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the securities purchase agreement. (vii)	good faith. if any event occurs as to which in the reasonable opinion of the board of directors of the company, in good faith, the other provisions of this section 2 are not strictly applicable but the lack of any adjustment in the exercise price or the number issuable or both would not in the opinion of the board of directors of the company fairly protect the exercise rights of the holder, in accordance with the basic intent and principles of such provisions, then the board of directors of the company shall appoint a firm of independent certified public accountants (which may be the regular auditors of the company) of recognized national standing, which shall give their opinion upon the adjustment, if any, to the exercise price or number issuable or both, as the case may be, on a basis consistent with the basic intent and principles of this section 2, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the exercise rights of all the registered holders of the warrants in accordance with this warrant certificate. (viii)	notice of change in exercise price. the company promptly shall deliver to each registered holder of warrants at least five (5) business days prior to effecting any transaction that would result in an increase or decrease in the exercise price pursuant to this section 2, a statement, signed by its independent certified public accountants, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased exercise price then in effect following such adjustment. (b)	subdivision; combination of stock or stock dividends. in case the company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, by split or otherwise, or issue additional shares of common stock as a dividend (other than a dividend in accordance with section 3 of the certificate of designations (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) in respect of the series a preferred stock), or make any other distribution upon any class or series of stock payable in shares of common stock or convertible securities, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and, conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock of the company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. (c)	reorganization; reclassification; consolidation; merger or sale of assets. in case of (i) any capital reorganization or reclassification or other change of outstanding shares of common stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the company is the resulting or surviving person and that does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding common stock) or (iii) transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets to another person (any of the foregoing, a "transaction"), the company, or such successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to each holder of the warrants evidenced hereby, at least five (5) business days prior to effecting any of the foregoing transactions, a certificate that the holder of each such warrant then outstanding shall have the right thereafter to exercise such warrant into the kind and highest amount of shares of stock or other securities (of the company or another issuer) or property or cash receivable upon such transaction by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such warrant could have been exercised immediately prior to such transaction. such certificate shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 2 and shall contain other terms identical to the terms hereof. if, in the case of any such transaction, the stock, other securities, cash or property receivable thereupon by a holder of common stock includes shares of stock or other securities of a person other than the successor or purchasing persons and other than the company, who controls or is controlled by the successor or purchasing person or who, in connection with such transaction, issues stock, securities, other property or cash to holders of common stock, then such certificate also shall be executed by such person, and such person shall, in such certificate, specifically assume the obligations of such successor or purchasing person and acknowledge its obligations to issue such stock, securities, other property or cash to holders of the warrants upon exercise thereof as provided above. the provisions of this section 2(c) similarly shall apply to successive transactions. (d)	adjustment for other distributions. if the company distributes to all holders of its common stock any of its assets (including but not limited to cash), debt securities, preferred stock, or any rights or warrants to purchase debt securities, preferred stock, assets or other securities of the company, the exercise price shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: 			e'	=	e	x	m - f 							 m where: e'	=	the adjusted exercise price. e	=	the current exercise price. m	=	the market price of one share of common stock on the record date mentioned below. f	=	the fair market value (determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company) on the record date of the assets, securities, rights or warrants applicable to one share of common stock. the adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution. this section 2(d) does not apply to any dividend or distribution that results in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 2(a) or section 2(b) above. section 3.	notice of certain events. in case at any time or from time to time the company shall declare any dividend or any other distribution to the holders of its common stock, or shall authorize the granting to the holders of its common stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right, or shall authorize the issuance or sale of any other shares or rights that would result in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 2(a) or section 2(d), or there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the common stock or consolidation or merger of the company with or into another person, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the company, or there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, then, in any one or more of such cases the company shall mail to each holder of the warrants evidenced hereby at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the company, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least ten (10) business days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, (b) the issue date of such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants or (c) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective. such notice also shall specify the date as of which it is expected that the holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for shares of stock or other securities or property or cash deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. section 4.	certain covenants. the company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued common stock or its authorized and issued common stock held as treasury stock, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue common stock upon exercise of the warrants, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants. the company shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock if at any time there shall be insufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to permit such reservation or to permit the exercise of all outstanding warrants. the company or, if appointed, the transfer agent for the common stock (the "transfer agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this warrant certificate on file with the transfer agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. the company will furnish such transfer agent a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto transmitted to the holder pursuant to section 2(a)(viii) hereof. before taking any action that would cause an adjustment pursuant to section 2 hereof to reduce the exercise price below the then par value (if any) of the common stock, the company will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel (which may be counsel employed by the company), be necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable common stock at the exercise price as so adjusted. the company covenants that all common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the warrants will, upon issue, be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof. section 5.	registered holder. the person in whose name this warrant certificate is registered shall be deemed the owner hereof and of the warrants

provided, however, that no new warrant certificate need be delivered if the warrant expiration date has occurred. such exercise shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of delivery of the warrant exercise documentation so that the person entitled to receive shares of series a preferred stock upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of series a preferred stock at such time. the company shall pay all expenses in connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges (other than income taxes of the holder) that may be imposed in respect of the issue or delivery of any shares of series a preferred stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants evidenced hereby. the company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any certificate for shares of series a preferred stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the warrants evidenced hereby. in connection with the exercise of any warrants evidenced hereby, at the company's option, no fractions of shares of series a preferred stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the company may elect to pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to any such fractional interest multiplied by $10.00 per share of series a preferred stock. if more than one such warrant shall be exercised by the holder thereof at the same time, the number of full shares of series a preferred stock issuable on such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the total number of warrants so exercised. section 2.	adjustments.

(c)	special distributions. in the event that the company shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution (including, without limitation, in cash, in notes or other debt securities or in capital stock (which shall include, without limitation, any options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock)) of the company, whether or not pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement (but excluding any dividend or distribution that results in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 2(a)) in other property or assets, to holders of series a preferred stock (a "special distribution"), then the board of directors shall set aside the amount of such dividend or distribution that each holder of warrants would have been entitled to receive had it exercised such warrants prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution. upon the exercise of a warrant evidenced hereby, the holder shall be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution that such holder would have received had such warrant been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution. section 3.	notice of certain events. in case at any time or from time to time the company shall declare any dividend or any other distribution to the holders of its series a preferred stock or common stock, or shall authorize the granting to the holders of its series a preferred stock or common stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right, or shall authorize the issuance or sale of any other shares or rights that would result in an adjustment to the exercise price pursuant to section 2(a) or would result in a special distribution described in section 2(c), or there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the series a preferred stock or common stock or consolidation or merger of the company with or into another person, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the company, or there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, then, in any one or more of such cases the company shall mail to each holder of the warrants evidenced hereby at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the company, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least ten (10) business days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of series a preferred stock or common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, (b) the issue date of such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants and (c) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective. such notice also shall specify the date as of which it is expected that the holders of series a preferred stock or common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their series a preferred stock or common stock for shares of stock or other securities or property or cash deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. section 4.	certain covenants. the company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued series a preferred stock or its authorized and issued series a preferred stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling

preferred stock (the "transfer agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this warrant certificate on file with the transfer agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. before taking any action that would cause an adjustment pursuant to section 2 hereof to reduce the exercise price below the then par value (if any) of the series a preferred stock, the company will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel (which may be counsel employed by the company), be necessary in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable series a preferred stock at the exercise price as so adjusted. the company covenants that all series a preferred stock that may be issued upon exercise of the warrants will, upon issue, be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof. section 5.	registered holder.
