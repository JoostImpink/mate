(d) parent indemnity claims shall be satisfied (i) first by the return to parent of escrow shares, and (ii) to the extent the value of the escrow shares is insufficient to cover such claims, by payment of cash from the principal shareholder and the trust, in each case within ten (10) days of the delivery of notice by a parent indemnified party of the nature and amount of the parent indemnity claims. provided, however, that to the extent a parent -------- ------- indemnity claim arises as a result of the breach of the representation contained in section 3.9(b)(17), such parent indemnity claim shall be satisfied by the return to parent of the additional escrow shares within ten (10) days of the delivery of notice to the principal shareholder by a parent indemnified party of the nature and amount of the parent indemnity claims. for purposes of satisfying parent indemnity claims and for purposes of section 8, each of the escrow shares shall be valued at the closing stock price. the shareholder representative, acting on behalf of the shareholders, may elect to pay cash in lieu of the obligations set forth in this paragraph. 8.3 limitations on indemnity. ------------------------ (a) maximum liability. the maximum aggregate amount of damages for ----------------- which the shareholders shall be severally and not jointly liable for parent indemnity claims made pursuant -53- to section 8.2(a) hereof shall be an amount equal to the total of (i) value of the escrow shares contributed by shareholders other than the principal shareholder and the trust (calculated based on the closing stock price) plus (ii) the portion of aggregate consideration distributable to the principal shareholder and the trust; provided, however, that the parent indemnity claims -------- ------- relating to any breach of the representation contained in section 3.9(b)(17) shall be limited to the additional escrow shares or cash deposited in the escrow in lieu thereof.

and (b) any costs or expenses with respect to the taxes indemnified hereunder. for purposes of this section 8.4, taxes shall include the amount of taxes which would have been paid but for the application of any credit or net operating or capital loss deduction attributable to any period (or portion thereof) ending after the closing date, but shall not include amounts which would have been paid but for the application of any credit or net operating or capital loss deductions attributable to any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the closing date, except that the parent indemnity claims relating to any breach of the -54- representation contained in section 3.9(b)(17) shall be limited to the additional escrow shares or cash deposited in the escrow in lieu thereof. the indemnification provisions of this section 8.4 shall not be subject to the limits on indemnification set forth in section 8.3, except that the parent indemnity claims relating to any breach of the representation contained in section 3.9(b)(17) shall be limited to the additional escrow shares or cash deposited in the escrow in lieu thereof. at shareholder representative's option, all or any portion of any indemnification obligations of the shareholders under this section 8.4 may be satisfied by a return of escrow shares to parent;
