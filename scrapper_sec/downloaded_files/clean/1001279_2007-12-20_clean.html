no registrable securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter&#8217;s marketing limitation shall be included in such registration.&#160;&#160;if any holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter.&#160;&#160;the registrable securities and/or other securities so withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such registration; provided, however , that, if by the withdrawal of such registrable securities a greater number of registrable securities held by other holders may be included in such registration (up to the maximum of any limitation imposed by the underwriters), then the company shall offer to all holders who have included registrable securities in the registration the right to include additional registrable securities pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth herein in the same proportion used above in determining the underwriter limitation. &#160;

(e) &#160;&#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 9 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall (i) contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand &#160; b-11 &#160; &#160; &#160; and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. no indemnified party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any&#160;indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; other indemnification . &#160;indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subsections of this section 9 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each holder of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the securities act. &#160;

provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under section 9(a) or (b) hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.&#160;&#160;in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such indemnified party a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist or the indemnified party may have defenses not available to the indemnifying party in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in such indemnified party&#8217;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defenses thereof or the indemnifying party fails to defend such claim in a diligent manner, other than reasonable costs of investigation.&#160;&#160;neither an indemnified nor an indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its consent.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the rights set forth above, in any event any party shall have the right to retain, at its own expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; in the event that an indemnifying party does or is not permitted to assume the defense of an action pursuant to section 9(c) or in the case of the expense reimbursement obligation set forth in section 9(a) and (b), the indemnification required by section 9(a) and (b) hereof shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills received or expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities are incurred. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 9 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall (i) contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party&#160;than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.&#160;&#160;no indemnified party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; other indemnification .&#160;&#160;indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subsections of this section 9 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each holder of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the securities act. &#160;

&#160; (c) &#160;&#160; except as set forth in the registration rights agreement, neither the company nor any other person is under any obligation to register the common shares under the securities act or any state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder;

2.7 &#160;&#160; legends .&#160;&#160;the investor understands that until (a) the common shares may be sold by the investor under rule 144(k) or (b) such time as the resale of the common shares has been registered under the securities act as contemplated by the registration rights agreement, the certificates representing the common shares will bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of the certificates for such common shares): &#160; the securities (the &#8220; securities &#8221;) evidenced hereby have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220; securities act &#8221;), and, accordingly, may not be offered or sold except as set forth in the following sentence. by its acquisition hereof, the holder agrees that it will not offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer (individually and collectively, a &#8220;

provided, however , that such indemnity agreement found in this section 9(b) shall in no event exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such holder. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer by any holder of such shares. &#160; (c) &#160;&#160; promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in section 9(a) or (b) hereof (including any governmental action), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such action; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under section 9(a) or (b) hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such indemnified party a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist or the indemnified party may have defenses not available to the indemnifying party in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless in such indemnified party&#8217;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of the defenses thereof or the indemnifying party fails to defend such claim in a diligent manner, other than reasonable costs of investigation. neither an indemnified nor an indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its consent. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the rights set forth above, in any event any party shall have the right to retain, at its own expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160; in the event that an indemnifying party does or is not permitted to assume the defense of an action pursuant to section 9(c) or in the case of the expense reimbursement obligation set forth in section 9(a) and (b), the indemnification required by section 9(a) and (b) hereof shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills received or expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities are incurred. &#160; (e) &#160;&#160; if the indemnification provided for in this section 9 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall (i) contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate relative fault of&#160;the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. no indemnified party guilty&#160; &#160; 11 &#160; of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; (f) &#160;&#160; other indemnification . indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subsections of this section 9 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each holder of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other than the securities act. &#160;

a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company; and such other reports and documents as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing it to sell any such securities without registration. &#160;
