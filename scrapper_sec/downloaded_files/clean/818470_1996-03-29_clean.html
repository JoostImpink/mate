(a) upon the occurrence of an event of default, and ----------------- from time to time thereafter prior to the date on which the principal amount hereof and all accrued interest thereon is paid in full (provided that if notice of redemption is delivered in accordance with the provisions of section 5 above, the right to convert shall terminate on the second business day next preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the issuer shall default in payment due upon redemption thereof), the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (or any portion thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000) (the "conversion amount") shall be convertible at the option of the holder into fully paid and non-assessable common stock of the issuer at the conversion rate (as defined below), subject in each case to the adjustments in the conversion rate pursuant to sections 8(b) and 11(j) below. the shares of common stock into which this debenture is convertible are hereinafter referred to as "conversion shares." - 5 - for purposes of this debenture the term "conversion rate" shall mean 500 shares of common stock for each $1,000 of conversion amount, provided that, if the plan of reorganization does not close as a result of a termination by the issuer pursuant to section 10.2(b) of the plan of reorganization based upon a material breach of the plan of reorganization by the holder, the conversion rate will be decreased to 333-1/3 shares of common stock for each $1,000 of conversion amount. (b) adjustments. the conversion rate from time to time in effect shall be ----------- subject to adjustment as follows: (i) in case the issuer shall (a) pay a dividend in shares of its common stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, or (d) issue by reclassification of its shares of common stock any shares of the issuer, the conversion rate in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted retroactively as provided below so that the holder of this debenture thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of the issuer to which he would have been entitled after the happening of any of the events described above had such debenture been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. an adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (i) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (ii) in case the issuer shall issue options, warrants or other rights to all holders of its common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share less than the fair market value per share of common stock (as defined in subsection (e) below), the number of shares of common stock into which each $1,000 of principal amount of and accrued interest on this debenture shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock into which the aggregate conversion amount was theretofore convertible by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights - 6 - or warrants plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such fair market value. subject to subsection (5), such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. (iii) in case the issuer shall distribute to all holders of its common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions) or rights to subscribe or warrants, options or other rights to purchase (excluding those referred to in subsection (ii) above), then in each such case the number of shares of common stock into which each $1,000 of principal amount of and accrued interest on this debenture shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock into which the aggregate conversion amount was theretofore convertible by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the fair market value (as defined in subsection (e) below) per share of common stock on the date of such distribution, and the denominator of which shall be such fair market value per share of the common stock, less the then fair market value (as determined by independent public accountants selected by the holder, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of the common stock. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. (iv) in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment to the conversion rate pursuant to subsection 8(b)(i), the holder shall become entitled to receive any shares of the issuer other than shares of its common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of this debenture shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions contained in this section 8 with respect to the common stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. - 7 - (c) no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this debenture. if the conversion of this debenture results in a fraction, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value (determined as provided by section 8(e)) of the common stock on the day of conversion shall be paid to such holder in cash by the issuer. (d) the issuer covenants that, upon conversion of this debenture as herein provided, there will be credited to the issuer's capital account, from the consideration for which the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion are issued, an amount per share of common stock so issued as determined by the issuer's board of directors, which amount shall not be less than the amount required by law and by the certificate of incorporation of the issuer, as amended, as in effect on the date of such conversion. for the purposes of this covenant the conversion amount, less the amount of cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares on such conversion, shall be deemed to be the amount of consideration for which the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion are issued. (e) no adjustment in the conversion shares shall be made by reason of the issuance of shares of common stock or any security convertible into shares of common stock in exchange for cash, property or services; provided, the value of such cash, property or services is equal to the fair market value of the common stock issued therefor. for purposes hereof, the term "fair market value" of the common stock shall mean, for any day, the last sale price per share for the common stock on the national association of securities dealers national market system, or, if the common stock shall not be listed on such system, the closing bid price per share in the over-the-counter market, in each such case, unless otherwise provided herein, averaged over a period of 5 consecutive trading days prior to the date as of which the determination is to be made. (f) the right to convert this debenture into common stock shall be exercised by the holder delivering written notice (the "conversion notice") and a copy of the debenture (provided that if the conversion notice relates to the exercise of conversion rights in respect of all of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest, the holder shall deliver the original debenture) to the issuer at its office in austin, texas. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the date such conversion - 8 - notice is sent to the issuer in accordance with this debenture. the holder shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such common stock on such date. in case of notice being given by the issuer for redemption pursuant to section 5 above, the right to convert principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on the debenture shall remain in effect until the close of business on the second business day preceding the date specified in the notice for redemption and, on that date, shall cease and terminate, unless previously exercised or the issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price for this debenture. upon conversion, the issuer shall deliver to the holder duly issued certificates representing the shares of fully paid and nonassessable common stock which constitute the conversion shares as well a new debenture on the same terms hereof representing the remaining principal amount which shall include all accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of conversion. (g) the issuer shall pay all expenses, taxes (other than income taxes of holder) and other charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of stock certificates and the new debenture pursuant to this section 8, except that, in case such stock certificates or new debenture shall be registered in a name or names other than the name of the holder of this debenture, funds sufficient to pay all stock transfer taxes, if any, which shall be payable upon the execution and delivery of such stock certificates or debenture shall be paid by the holder to the issuer at the time of delivering the debenture to the issuer upon exercise. 9. transfer of debenture and conversion shares. (a) the holder of this ------------------------------------------- debenture, by acceptance hereof, represents and acknowledges that this debenture and the conversion shares which may be purchased upon exercise of the conversion rights contained in section 8 hereof are not being registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"). the holder is acquiring this debenture for investment for its own account, with no intention of reselling or otherwise distributing the same without registration under the securities act, except pursuant to a valid exemption under the securities act. neither this debenture nor the conversion shares issuable hereunder may be transferred except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act, (ii) to any affiliate of holder, or a nominee thereof, or (iii) pursuant to a valid exemption from registration under the securities act. - 9 - 10. capitalization of the issuer. the issuer represents and warrants to ---------------------------- the holder that the authorized capital stock of the issuer is 20,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value, (the "common stock") of which 4,623,735 shares are issued and outstanding on the date hereof. all such shares of the common stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. 11. additional agreements of the issuer. the issuer agrees with the ----------------------------------- holder and with any holder of conversion shares acquired upon conversion of all or a portion of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest that: (a) character of conversion shares. all shares which may be issued ------------------------------ upon the exercise of the rights contained in the debenture, have been duly authorized by the issuer's board of directors and upon issuance, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes (other than income taxes of holder), liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof;

agreement for the exchange of stock of calcomp inc. for stock of summagraphics corporation (this "agreement"), dated this 19th day of march, 1996, is entered into by and among lockheed martin corporation, a maryland corporation ("lockheed martin"), calcomp inc., a california corporation ("calcomp") and summagraphics corporation, a delaware corporation ("summagraphics"). lockheed martin, calcomp and summagraphics individually are being referred to herein as a "party" and collectively are referred to herein as "parties." w i t n e s e t h: - - - - - - - - - whereas, calcomp has an authorized capital of 1,000 shares of common stock of which 1,000 shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this agreement, all of which are owned by lockheed martin; whereas, summagraphics has an authorized capital of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 4,623,735 shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this agreement, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which are outstanding as of the date of this agreement; whereas, the boards of directors of each of lockheed martin, calcomp and summagraphics deem it advisable and in the best interests of the parties and their stockholders that lockheed martin exchange all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of calcomp for a number of newly issued shares of common stock of summagraphics (the "exchange"), as determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1.3 below; whereas, the board of directors of summagraphics has approved (i) the transactions contemplated by this agreement, (ii) the fourth amended and restated articles of incorporation (as defined in section 5.3) and (iii) the stock option plan (as defined in section 5.8) and recommended their submission to the stockholders of summagraphics for approval; whereas, the parties desire the exchange to qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of section 368(a)(1)(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"); and whereas, the parties desire to provide for certain undertakings, conditions, warranties, representations and covenants in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants, agreements, representations and warranties herein contained, the parties agree as follows: article i the exchange 1.1 the exchange. upon performance of all covenants and obligations ------------ of the parties contained in this agreement and upon the terms and conditions contained herein, on the closing date (as hereinafter defined) lockheed martin agrees to transfer and deliver, or cause to be transferred and delivered, to summagraphics all of the issued and outstanding calcomp common stock (the "calcomp exchange shares"), and summagraphics agrees to issue and deliver to lockheed martin (or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin) such number of shares of summagraphics common stock as is determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1.3 below (the "summagraphics exchange shares"). as a result of the exchange, summagraphics shall own 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of calcomp and lockheed martin (or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary) shall own in the aggregate 89.7% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of summagraphics common stock outstanding immediately following the exchange (on a fully diluted basis). 1.2 closing. the consummation of the transactions contemplated by ------- this agreement (the "closing") will take place at such time on a date not prior to may 8, 1996 (the "closing date") as shall be mutually agreed to by lockheed martin and summagraphics but in any case shall be as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the date of summagraphics' special meeting of stockholders called to consider the exchange. in no event shall the closing date be later than may 31, 1996, provided that if securities and exchange commission clearance of the proxy statement (as hereinafter defined) occurs after april 26, 1996, the time for the closing will be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days after april 26, 1996 that such clearance is received, but in no event beyond june 15, 1996. 1.3 determination of summagraphics exchange shares. the number of ---------------------------------------------- summagraphics exchange shares delivered to lockheed martin shall equal a number of shares of summagraphics common stock determined so that immediately after the exchange lockheed martin owns 89.7% of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of summagraphics determined on a fully diluted basis. for purposes of this agreement, "fully diluted basis" shall mean a basis whereby - 2 - the aggregate number of shares of common stock for such determination includes (i) all summagraphics common stock then issued and outstanding, (ii) all summagraphics common stock that would be issued and outstanding upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of all outstanding warrants, options or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of summagraphics common stock (or rights to acquire any such warrants, options or other rights), regardless of whether such warrants, options or other rights are then exercisable, convertible or exchangeable, (iii) all summagraphics common stock which would be outstanding upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of all outstanding evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or other securities (or rights to acquire any of the foregoing) which are or may be exercisable, convertible or exchangeable into shares of common stock, regardless of whether such evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities are then exercisable, convertible or exchangeable, and (iv) the summagraphics exchange shares issuable upon such determination but excluding summagraphics common stock issuable upon conversion of the secured convertible debenture. for purposes of subsections (ii) and (iii) above, the number of shares of summagraphics common stock issuable pursuant to options, warrants and rights of conversion that will be deemed to be outstanding will be determined using the "treasury stock method" of accounting as defined in apb opinion 15 based on an average of the closing prices, as reported in the wall street journal -- nasdaq national market issues, for the five days preceding closing. an example of the calculation provided above is attached as schedule 1.3. 1.4 employee benefits. employees of calcomp and its subsidiaries ----------------- (each subsidiary of calcomp is hereinafter referred to as a "calcomp subsidiary" or collectively as the "calcomp subsidiaries") immediately prior to the exchange will be eligible to continue to participate in all of the employee benefit programs of calcomp in which such employees were eligible to participate on the same terms and conditions as were previously applicable; provided, however, that they continue to meet the eligibility requirements of those programs. employees of summagraphics and its subsidiaries (each subsidiary of summagraphics is hereinafter referred to as a "summagraphics subsidiary" or collectively as the "summagraphics subsidiaries") who are employees of summagraphics or a summagraphics subsidiary immediately prior to the exchange and who are not made eligible to participate in the employee benefit programs of calcomp following the exchange will be eligible to continue to participate in all of the employee benefit plans of summagraphics in which such employees were eligible to participate prior to the exchange on the same terms and conditions as were - 3 - previously applicable; provided, however, that they continue to meet the eligibility requirements of those programs. in the event that the parties shall determine to extend eligibility to participate in the employee benefit programs of calcomp to employees who are employees of summagraphics immediately prior to the exchange, (i) service with summagraphics and summagraphics subsidiaries shall be considered service with calcomp for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under all such calcomp employee benefit programs and (ii) medical plans of calcomp will offer summagraphics' employees full coverage for pre- existing conditions and credit for deductibles and co-insurance payments to date during the plan year. notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this section 1.4 shall be deemed to convey any right or benefit upon any employee of calcomp or calcomp subsidiaries or summagraphics or summagraphics subsidiaries nor shall any such employee be entitled to enforce any provision of this section 1.4. nothing contained in this section 1.4 shall be deemed to prohibit summagraphics or calcomp or any of their respective subsidiaries from terminating any employment relationship or any employee benefit program or changing the terms or conditions of employment or any employee benefit program at any time following the closing. 1.5 board of directors of summagraphics. at the closing, ----------------------------------- summagraphics shall deliver to lockheed martin letters effecting the resignation as of closing of each of the then current directors of summagraphics whose resignation is requested in writing by lockheed martin prior to closing and lockheed martin shall appoint new directors by written consent. lockheed martin shall provide information with respect to the composition of the board of directors which it will appoint for use in connection with the proxy statement (as hereinafter defined). 1.6 officers of summagraphics. at the closing, summagraphics shall ------------------------- deliver to lockheed martin letters effecting the resignation as of closing of each of the then current officers of summagraphics whose resignation is requested in writing by lockheed martin prior to closing and the new board of directors of summagraphics to be appointed by written consent of lockheed martin under section 1.5 above shall appoint new officers by written consent. notwithstanding such resignations, it is understood and agreed that the officers are not waiving any rights they otherwise may have under employment and severance arrangements existing as of february 1, 1996 or any additional arrangements approved by lockheed martin and calcomp. - 4 - 1.7 name change. effective upon the closing, summagraphics shall ----------- change its name to calcomp inc. and calcomp shall change its name to calcomp technologies, inc. 1.8 treatment of stock options/severance/incentive compensation. the ----------------------------------------------------------- manner in which currently outstanding employee stock options, employee severance payments and employee incentive compensation will be treated is as reflected on the letter attached to this agreement as schedule 1.8. 1.9 certain definitions. as used in this agreement, the following ------------------- terms shall have the meanings set forth below: (a) "material" means material to summagraphics or calcomp (as the case may be) and its respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and determined in light of the facts and circumstances of the matter in question; provided, that any specific monetary amount stated in this agreement with respect to materiality shall determine materiality in that instance.
