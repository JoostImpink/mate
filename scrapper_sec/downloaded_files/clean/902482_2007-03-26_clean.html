(d)&#150;(e). during the last five years, neither parent, nor purchaser, nor, to the knowledge of parent and purchaser, any of the individuals listed in annex i, has been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding has been or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration parent and the purchaser estimate that the total funds required to complete the offer (as defined in item 4 below) and the merger (as defined in item 4 below) will be approximately $452 million, plus any related transaction fees and expenses. the purchaser acquired, and will in the future acquire, all funds for the purchase of shares in the offer and for the payment of the applicable merger consideration in the merger from parent. the parent obtained the funds provided to purchaser out of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and parent&#146;s existing credit facility. on march 16, 2007, parent borrowed $200 million under its existing credit facility. item 4. purpose of transaction on february 11, 2007, the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#147;merger agreement&#148;), with parent and purchaser, under which purchaser commenced a tender offer (the &#147;offer&#148;) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common stock (the &#147;shares&#148;) for a purchase price of $24.00 per share, net to the holders thereof, in cash (the &#147;offer price&#148;). under the merger agreement, after the completion of the offer and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the merger, the purchaser will be 4 merged with and into the company, with the company surviving the merger (sometimes referred to as the &#147;surviving corporation&#148;) as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of parent (the &#147;merger&#148;). the purpose of the offer is to enable the purchaser to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. the offer is being made pursuant to the merger agreement and is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be effected and reduce the time required for stockholders to receive the transaction consideration and to the complete the acquisition of the company. the purpose of the merger is to acquire all issued and outstanding shares not purchased in the offer. the transaction structure includes the merger to ensure the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares. if the merger is completed, parent will own 100% of the equity interests of the company, and will be entitled to all of the benefits resulting from that interest. these benefits include complete control of the company and entitlement to any increase in its value. similarly, parent would also bear the risk of any losses incurred in the operation of the company and any decrease in value of the company. the initial offering period of the offer expired on march 16, 2007. on march 19, 2007, parent issued a press release announcing the results of the offer and that purchaser had accepted for payment all shares tendered in the offer through march 16, 2007. based on the number of shares validly tendered and accepted for payment at the end of the initial offering period of the offer, purchaser acquired 15,347,000 shares, which represented approximately 87.4% of all outstanding shares. based on the offer price, the value of such shares purchased by purchaser was approximately $368.3 million. purchaser acquired the funds used by purchaser to purchase the shares from parent. on march 19, 2007, parent also announced that purchaser has commenced a subsequent offering period for all remaining shares to permit the company stockholders who have not yet tendered their shares the opportunity to do so. this subsequent offering period will expire at 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on friday, march 30, 2007, unless further extended. the same $24.00 per share offer price will be paid during the subsequent offering period. all shares validly tendered during this subsequent offering period will be immediately accepted and payment will be made promptly after acceptance, in accordance with the terms of the offer. as of the date of this filing, the purchaser has acquired an additional 881,403 shares resulting in the purchaser beneficially owning an aggregate of 16,228,403 shares representing approximately 92.4% of all outstanding shares. pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, parent expects to effect a merger of purchaser with and into the company. in the merger, purchaser will acquire all other shares (other than those as to which holders properly exercise appraisal rights) at the same $24.00 per share price, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, that was paid in the offer. as a result of the merger, the company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. parent intends to complete the merger as soon as practicable. as a result of the purchaser&#146;s ownership of more than 92.4% of the shares, all shares not tendered during the subsequent offering period, and not held by a holder who demands appraisal for such shares under the delaware general corporation law, will be converted into the right to receive $24.00 per share in cash pursuant to a short form merger which will occur promptly after the expiration of the subsequent offering period. the implementation of the short form merger will not require a meeting of stockholders. the company stockholders who continue to hold their shares at the time of the merger and fulfill certain other requirements of delaware law will have appraisal rights in connection with the merger. the merger agreement provides that, effective upon the acceptance for payment of the shares pursuant to the offer, purchaser will be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors (the &#147;purchaser designees&#148;), rounded up to the next whole number, on the company&#146;s board of directors (the &#147;board&#148;) as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by purchaser pursuant to the merger agreement) and (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by parent, purchaser and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of shares then outstanding. the merger agreement also provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event the purchaser designees are elected to the board, at least three directors who were directors of the company on february 11, 2007, the date the merger agreement was signed, will continue to serve on the board until the effective time of the merger; (ii) each of such directors must be an &#147;independent director&#148; as defined by rule 4200(a)(15) of the nasdaq stock market rules and eligible to serve on the company&#146;s audit committee under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and the nasdaq stock market rules; and (iii) at least one such director must be an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; as defined in item 5 401(h) of regulation s-k and the instructions thereto. pursuant to the merger agreement and effective as of 2:00 p.m. eastern time on march 19, 2007, (i) andrew e. senyei, md, who served as a member of the board&#146;s compensation committee; emory v. anderson; and kathleen d. laporte, who served as a member of the board&#146;s nominating and corporate governance committee, each resigned as directors of the company; and (ii) the board appointed patrick j. sullivan, john p. mcdonough, timothy m. adams and tony kingsley, each a purchaser designee, as a director to serve on the board until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. mr. sullivan will serve as a class ii director, mr. mcdonough will serve as a class i director, mr. adams will serve as a class iii director and mr. kingsley will serve as a class iii director. it has not yet been determined which committees of the board to which these directors are expected to be named. upon consummation of the merger, the directors of purchaser shall be the directors of the surviving corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. upon consummation of the merger, the officers of purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the merger shall be the officers of the surviving corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. at the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation will be amended to be in the forms attached to the merger agreement. after completion of the offer and the merger, parent anticipates that it will seek to cause the shares to be deregistered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and delisted from quotation on nasdaq. after completion of the offer and the merger, the reconstituted company board of directors expects to work with the company&#146;s management to evaluate and review the company and its business, assets, corporate structure, operations, properties and strategic alternatives, and to integrate the company into parent&#146;s business and market units. as a result of this review and integration, it is possible that parent could implement changes to the company&#146;s business or capitalization that could involve consolidating and streamlining certain operations and reorganizing or disposing of other businesses and operations. the purchaser and, after completion of the offer and the merger, the reconstituted company board of directors, reserve the right to change their plans and intentions at any time, as deemed appropriate. except as set forth in this item 4, the filing persons have no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. the preceding summary of certain provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto, is not intended to

with the depository for the offer. as a result of the subsequent offering period, the purchaser has acquired an additional 881,403 shares resulting in the purchaser beneficially owning an aggregate of
