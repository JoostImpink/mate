(ii) each participating stockholder shall similarly indemnify and hold harmless the company, its controlling persons and their respective shareholders, officers, directors, partners, trustees, employees and agents, against any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions but only insofar as the same shall arise out of or be based upon any untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such participating stockholder to the company for use in the registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that in no event shall any participating's stockholder liability under any provision of this section 5 exceed the amount of proceeds received by such participating stockholder. (iii) each party entitled to indemnification under this paragraph 5(k) (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided, that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, further, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this paragraph 5(k) except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced thereby. the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay such expense if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not (1) include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and (2) provide that such indemnified party does not admit any fault or guilt with respect to the subject matter of such claim or litigation; and no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or settle such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. page 20 of 28 pages (l) contribution. if the indemnification provided for herein is for any reason unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits from the offering of the securities received by, and the relative fault in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions of, said indemnifying party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by a party shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) or underwriting discounts and commissions, as the case may be, received by such party bear to the total proceeds from the offering received by all parties (including underwriting discounts and commissions by the underwriters). the relative fault of a party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (m) information. in connection with any registration hereunder, each participating stockholder shall furnish to the company such information regarding such participating stockholder and the plan of distribution proposed by such participating stockholder as the company may reasonably request in writing or as shall be legally required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein.
