(h) compliance with applicable laws; litigation. (i) rsi, its ------------------------------------------- subsidiaries and employees hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all governmental entities which are required for the operation of the businesses of rsi and its subsidiaries (the "rsi permits"), except where the failure to have any such rsi permits individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. rsi and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the rsi permits and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, except where the failure so to comply individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. as of the date of this agreement, except as disclosed in the rsi filed sec documents, no action, demand, requirement or investigation by any governmental entity and no suit, action or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to rsi or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge (as defined in section 8.3) of rsi, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which individually or in the aggregate would not (a) have a material adverse effect on rsi or (b) reasonably be expected to impair the ability of rsi to perform its obligations under this agreement or the option agreements or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. (ii) neither rsi nor any rsi subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, injunction or decree which has had or, -19- insofar as can be reasonably foreseen, individually or in the aggregate will have, a material adverse effect on rsi.

(j) erisa compliance. (i) with respect to the rsi benefit plans, no ---------------- event has occurred and, to the knowledge of rsi, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which rsi or any of its subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on rsi under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended ("erisa"), the code or any other applicable law. (ii) each rsi benefit plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, except for any failures so to administer any rsi benefit plan that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. rsi, its subsidiaries and all the rsi benefit plans have been operated, and are, in compliance with the applicable provisions of erisa, the code and all other applicable laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any -20- failures to be in such compliance that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. each rsi benefit plan that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the code has received a favorable determination letter from the internal revenue service ("irs") that it is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any rsi benefit plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(a) of the code has received a determination letter from the irs that such trust is so exempt. to the knowledge of rsi, no fact or event has occurred since the date of any determination letter from the irs which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any such rsi benefit plan or the exempt status of any such trust. (iii) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any unsatisfied liability under title iv of erisa (other than liability for premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation arising in the ordinary course). no rsi benefit plan has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of section 302 of erisa or section 412 of the code) whether or not waived. to the knowledge of rsi, there are not any facts or circumstances that would materially change the funded status of any rsi benefit plan that is a "defined benefit" plan (as defined in section 3(35) of erisa) since the date of the most recent actuarial report for such plan. each rsi benefit plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section 3(37) of erisa is set forth on section 3.1(j)(iii) of the rsi disclosure schedule. (iv) with respect to each of the rsi benefit plans (other than any multiemployer plan) that is subject to title iv of erisa, the present value of accrued benefits under each such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to such plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the aggregate assets of such plans allocable to such accrued benefits in any material respect. with respect to any rsi benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan, (a) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has any contingent liability under section 4204 of erisa, and no circumstances exist that present a material risk that any such plan will go into reorganization, and (b) the aggregate withdrawal liability of rsi and its subsidiaries, computed as if a complete withdrawal by rsi and any of its subsidiaries had occurred under each such rsi benefit plan on the date hereof, would not be material. (v) no rsi benefit plan provides medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former -21- employees after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated by applicable law or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee) other than individual arrangements the amounts of which are not material. (vi) rsi has previously provided to jpfi a copy of each collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by rsi or any of its subsidiaries to which rsi or any of its subsidiaries is a party. no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated or renegotiated by rsi or any of its subsidiaries. as of the date of this agreement, there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against rsi or any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of rsi, threatened which may interfere with the respective business activities of rsi or any of its subsidiaries, except where such dispute, strike or work stoppage individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. as of the date of this agreement, to the knowledge of rsi, none of rsi, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or employees has committed any material unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of rsi or any of its subsidiaries, and there is no material charge or complaint against rsi or any of its subsidiaries by the national labor relations board or any comparable governmental agency pending or threatened in writing. (vii) no employee of rsi will be entitled to any material payment, additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any rsi benefit plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as a termination of employment), except that substantially all rsi employee stock options will vest as of the date on which rsi stockholder approval is obtained. (k) taxes. (i) each of rsi and its subsidiaries has filed all ----- material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (taking into account all applicable extensions) and all such returns and reports are complete and correct in all material respects, or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. rsi and each of its subsidiaries has paid (or rsi has paid or caused to be paid on its behalf) all taxes (as defined herein) shown as due on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in -22- the rsi filed sec documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with gaap for all taxes payable by rsi and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. (ii) no deficiencies for any taxes have, to the knowledge of rsi, been proposed, asserted or assessed against rsi or any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. the federal income tax returns of rsi and each of its subsidiaries consolidated in such returns for tax years through 1993 (1992 in the case of u.s. foodservice and its subsidiaries) have closed by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations. (iii) neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the code. (iv) as used in this agreement, "taxes" shall include all (x) federal, state, local or foreign income, property, sales, excise and other taxes or similar governmental charges, including any interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto, (y) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in (x) as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (z) liability for the payment of any amounts described in (x) or (y) as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (x) or (y). (l) voting requirements. the affirmative vote at the rsi ------------------- stockholders meeting (the "rsi stockholder approval") of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of rsi common stock to adopt this agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of rsi's capital stock necessary to approve and adopt this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger. (m) state takeover statutes; certain provisions of rsi certificate. -------------------------------------------------------------- the board of directors of rsi has adopted a resolution or resolutions approving this agreement and the option agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and, assuming the accuracy of jpfi's representation and warranty contained in section 3.2(q), (a) such approval constitutes approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the option agreements by the rsi board of -23- directors under (i) the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl such that section 203 of the dgcl does not apply to this agreement, the option agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) section a.2. of article fourteenth of the rsi certificate such that the 80% vote otherwise required by article fourteenth does not apply to this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and (b) for purposes of article twelfth of the rsi certificate ("article twelfth"), such approval constitutes approval of this agreement and the option agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the rsi board of directors has conclusively determined, pursuant to article twelfth, that such agreements together constitute the "memorandum of understanding" contemplated by article twelfth) for purposes of section b of article twelfth such that the 80% vote otherwise required by article twelfth does not apply to this agreement, the option agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. to the knowledge of rsi, except for section 203 of the dgcl (which has been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is applicable to the merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. (n) accounting matters. to its knowledge, neither rsi nor any of its ------------------ affiliates (as such term is used in section 5.10) has taken or agreed to take any action (including, without limitation, in connection with any rsi stock plan or any agreement thereunder) that would prevent the business combination to be effected by the merger from being accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and rsi has no reason to believe that the merger will not qualify for "pooling of interests" accounting. (o) brokers. no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or ------- other person other than merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated ("merrill lynch") and wasserstein perella & co., inc. ("wasserstein") , the fees and expenses of which will be paid by rsi, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of rsi. rsi has furnished to jpfi true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such fees or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are payable. (p) opinions of financial advisors. rsi has received the opinions of ------------------------------ merrill lynch and wasserstein, each dated the date of this agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio for the conversion of rsi common stock into jpfi common stock is fair from a financial point of -24- view to holders of shares of rsi common stock (other than jpfi and its affiliates), signed copies of which opinions have been delivered to jpfi, it being understood and agreed by jpfi that such opinions are for the benefit of the board of directors of rsi and may not be relied upon by jpfi, its affiliates or any of their respective stockholders. (q) ownership of jpfi common stock. to the knowledge of rsi, as of ------------------------------ the date hereof (and before giving effect to the jpfi option agreement, which will be entered into immediately after the execution of this agreement), neither rsi nor, to its knowledge without independent investigation, any of its affiliates, (i) beneficially owns (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act), directly or indirectly, or (ii) is party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, shares of capital stock of jpfi. (r) intellectual property. rsi and its subsidiaries own or have a --------------------- valid license to use all trademarks, service marks, trade names, patents and copyrights (including any registrations or applications for registration of any of the foregoing) (collectively, the "rsi intellectual property") necessary to carry on its business substantially as currently conducted except for such rsi intellectual property the failure of which to own or validly license individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. neither rsi nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with, and, to rsi's knowledge, there are no infringements of or conflicts (i) with the rights of others with respect to the use of, or (ii) by others with respect to, any rsi intellectual property that individually or in the aggregate, in either such case, would have a material adverse effect on rsi. (s) certain contracts. except as set forth in the rsi filed sec ----------------- documents, neither rsi nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of regulation s-k of the sec), (ii) any non-competition agreement or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit in any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any material portion of the business of rsi and its subsidiaries (including, for purposes of this section 3.1(s), jpfi and its subsidiaries, assuming the merger has taken place), taken as a whole, is or would be conducted, (iii) any exclusive supply or purchase contracts or any exclusive requirements contracts or (iv) any contract or other agreement which would prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the merger or any -25- of the transactions contemplated by this agreement (all contracts of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to herein as "rsi material contracts"). rsi has delivered to jpfi, prior to the execution of this agreement, complete and correct copies of all rsi material contracts not filed as exhibits to the rsi filed sec documents. each rsi material contract is valid and binding on rsi (or, to the extent a rsi subsidiary is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and rsi and each rsi subsidiary have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each rsi material contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on rsi. neither rsi nor any rsi subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of rsi, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any rsi material contract. (t) rsi rights agreement. rsi has taken all action (including, if -------------------- required, redeeming all of the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the rsi rights agreement or amending the rsi rights agreement) so that the entering into of this agreement, the rsi option agreement and the support agreement, the merger, the acquisition of shares pursuant to the rsi option agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the rsi rights agreement or enable or require the rsi rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. (u) environmental liability. there are no legal, administrative, ----------------------- arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature pending or threatened against rsi or any of its subsidiaries seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of, on rsi or any of its subsidiaries, any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including, without limitation, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, as amended ("cercla"), which liability or obligation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on rsi. to the knowledge of rsi, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on rsi. -26- section 3.2. representations and warranties of jpfi and merger sub. ----------------------------------------------------- except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by jpfi and merger sub to rsi prior to the execution of this agreement (the "jpfi disclosure schedule") and making reference to the particular subsection of this agreement to which exception is being taken, jpfi and merger sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to rsi as follows: (a) organization, standing and corporate power.

(k) taxes. (i) each of jpfi and its subsidiaries has filed all ----- material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (taking into account applicable extensions) and all such returns and reports are complete and correct in all material respects, or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. jpfi and each of its subsidiaries has paid (or jpfi has paid or caused to be paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns, and the most recent financial statements contained in the jpfi filed sec documents reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with gaap for all taxes payable by jpfi and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements. -36- (ii) no deficiencies for any taxes have, to the knowledge of jpfi, been proposed, asserted or assessed against jpfi or any of its subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies that individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on jpfi. none of the federal income tax returns of jpfi and each of its subsidiaries consolidated in such returns have closed by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations.

(b) voluntary termination. (i) by the executive. the executive may voluntarily terminate the agreement (including without limitation by retirement) at any time by notice to the company as provided in section 14(f). the executive's death during the term of the agreement shall constitute a voluntary termination of employment for purposes of eligibility for termination payments and benefits as provided in section 9. (ii) by the company. notwithstanding the provisions of section 8(a) above, the company shall have the absolute right to terminate the employment of the executive effective on or after the first anniversary of the effective date, and such termination shall not be considered an involuntary termination, provided that the company gives written notice of such termination to the executive at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such termination. (c) subject to section 9 and any benefit continuation requirements of applicable laws, in the event the executive's employment hereunder is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated for any reason whatsoever, the compensation and benefits obligations of the company under sections 4 and 5 -5- shall cease as of the effective date of such termination, except for any compensation and benefits earned or accrued but unpaid through such date. 9. termination payments and benefits. if the executive's employment hereunder is involuntarily terminated by the company other than for cause (as defined herein) prior to the end of the term of this agreement, then the company shall be obligated to pay to the executive certain termination payments and make available certain benefits during the termination payment period, as follows: (a) termination payment period. the termination payment period shall be the fraction of a year, if any, remaining from the date of termination to the first anniversary of the effective date.

(c) method of payment. the termination payment shall be paid to the executive in a lump sum payment in cash or by check or wire transfer within five (5) days or the termination of the executive's employment. (d) benefits. (i) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any option agreement or other agreement or in any plan, (x) all of the executive's outstanding stock options shall immediately become exercisable and (y) all restrictions on any other equity awards shall lapse and such awards shall vest. (ii) during the termination payment period as set forth above in subsection (a), the company shall use its best efforts to maintain in full force and effect for -6- the continued benefit of the executive all employee welfare benefit plans and perquisite programs in which the executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the executive's termination or shall arrange to make available to the executive benefits substantially similar to those which the executive would otherwise have been entitled to receive if his employment had not been terminated. such welfare benefits shall be provided to the executive on the same terms and conditions (including employee contributions toward the premium payments) under which the executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to his termination. the company does not guarantee a favorable tax consequence to the executive for continued coverage and benefits under the company-sponsored plans nor will it indemnify the executive for such results except with respect to the life insurance plan made available under section 5. (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the executive's continued coverage under the company's medical and dental plan, or a successor plan, pursuant to this provision, the executive's "qualifying event" for purposes of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 ("cobra") shall be his date of termination from the company. (iv) any termination payments hereunder shall not be taken into account for purposes of any retirement plan or other benefit plan sponsored by the company, except as otherwise expressly required by such plans or applicable law.

(e) termination for cause. for purposes of this agreement, "cause" shall mean -7- (i) the willful and continued failure of the executive to perform substantially the executive's duties with the company or one of its subsidiaries (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the executive by the chief executive officer which specifically identifies the manner in which the chief executive officer believes that the executive has not substantially performed the executive's duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by the executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the company, its successors or assigns. for purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the company. any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the board or upon the instructions of the chief executive officer or based upon the advice of counsel for the company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the executive in good faith and in the best interests of the company. the cessation of employment of the executive shall not be deemed to be for cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the board at a meeting of the board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the executive and the executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the board, the executive has engaged in the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. (f) change in control. a "change in control" of the company shall mean any of the following events that occurs after the effective date: -8- (i) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the board (the "incumbent board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the incumbent board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the incumbent board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person (as defined in section 9(f)(ii)) other than the board; or (ii) any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) (a "person") is or becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act) of 50% or more of the company's stock generally entitled to vote for the election of directors ("voting stock") or the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or other transaction (a "business transaction"), in each case, unless, following such business transaction, (i) no person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the company or such corporation resulting from such business transaction) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the company or the corporation resulting from such business transaction and (ii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such business transaction were members of the incumbent board at the time of the execution of the -9- initial agreement, or of the action of the board, providing for such business transaction; or (iii) approval by the shareholders of the company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the company. (iv) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of subsection (f), the merger shall not constitute a change in control. (g) disability defined. "disability" shall mean the absence of the executive from the executive's duties with the company on a full- time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the company, its successors or assigns or its insurers and acceptable to the executive or the executive's legal representative. (h) no obligation to mitigate. the executive is under no obligation to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for hereunder by seeking other employment or otherwise; provided, however, that the executive's coverage under the company's welfare benefit plans will terminate when the executive becomes covered under any employee benefit plan made available by another employer and covering the same type of benefits. the executive shall notify the company within thirty (30) days after the commencement of any such benefits. (i) effect of change of control agreement and prior agreement. the executive's severance benefits under section 9 (d) (ii) of this agreement shall be reduced to the extent that the executive is or becomes entitled to receive comparable benefits under the terms of the prior agreement or the "change in control agreement". (j) certain additional payments by the company. (i) anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the company to or for the benefit of the executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this -10- agreement or otherwise (including, without limitation, amounts attributable to the acceleration of vesting of stock options), but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this section 9(k)) (a "payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "excise tax"), then the executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "gross-up payment") in an amount such that after payment by the executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and excise tax imposed upon the gross-up payment, the executive retains an amount of the gross-up payment equal to the excise tax imposed upon the payments. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 9(k)(i), if it shall be determined that the executive is entitled to a gross-up payment, but that the payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount (the "reduced amount") that could be paid to the executive such that the receipt of payments would not give rise to any excise tax, then no gross-up payment shall be made to the executive and the payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the reduced amount. (ii) subject to the provisions of section 9(k)(iii), all determinations required to be made under this section 9(k), including whether and when a gross-up payment is required and the amount of such gross-up payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by kpmg peat marwick or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the executive (the "accounting firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the company and the executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the executive that there has been a payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the company. in the event that the accounting firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change of control, the executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the accounting firm hereunder). all -11- fees and expenses of the accounting firm shall be borne solely by the company. any gross-up payment, as determined pursuant to this section 9(k), shall be paid by the company to the executive within five days of the receipt of the accounting firm's determination. any determination by the accounting firm shall be binding upon the company and the executive. as a result of the uncertainty in the application of section 4999 of the code at the time of the initial determination by the accounting firm hereunder, it is possible that cross-up payments which will not have been made by the company should have been made ("underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. in the event that the company exhausts its remedies pursuant to section 9(k) (iii) and the executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any excise tax, the accounting firm shall determine the amount of the underpayment that has occurred and any such underpayment shall be promptly paid by the company to or for the benefit of the executive. (iii) the executive shall notify the company in writing of any claim by the internal revenue service that, if successful, would require the payment by the company of the gross-up payment. such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. the executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the company (or such shorter period ending on the date than any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). if the company notifies the executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the executive shall: (a) give the company any information reasonably requested by the company relating to such claim, (b) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the company, -12- (c) cooperate with the company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and (d) permit the company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any excise tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this section 9(k) (iii), the company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the company shall determine; provided, however, that if the company directs the executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the company shall advance the amount of such payment to the executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any excise tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. furthermore, the company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a gross-up payment would be payable hereunder and the executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the internal revenue service or any other taxing authority. (iv) if, after the receipt by the executive of an amount advanced by the company pursuant to section 9(k) (iii), the executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the executive shall (subject to the company's complying with the requirements of section 9(k) (iii)) promptly pay to the company the amount of such refund (together -13- with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). if, after the receipt by the executive of an amount advanced by the company pursuant to section 9(k)(iii), a determination is made that the executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the company does not notify the executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of gross-up payment required to be paid. 10. additional covenants of the executive.

(a) each stockholder hereby agrees to ----------------- attend the rykoff stockholders meeting, in person or by proxy, and to vote (or cause to be voted) all subject shares, and any other voting securities of rykoff, whether issued heretofore or hereafter, that such stockholder owns or has the right to vote, for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. such agreement to vote shall apply also to any adjournment or adjournments of the rykoff stockholders meeting, and to any other meeting of stockholders at which any item of business referred to in the preceding sentence is presented for approval. (b) to the extent inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this section 1, each stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies with respect to such stockholder's subject shares or any other voting securities of rykoff. section 2. no solicitation. no stockholder shall, directly or --------------- indirectly, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or authorize any individual, corporation or other entity to solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing information), from any third party any inquiries or proposals relating to, or conduct negotiations or discussions with any third party with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any proposal or offer relating to the disposition of business or assets of rykoff or jpfi or their respective subsidiaries, or the acquisition of the voting securities of rykoff or jpfi or their respective subsidiaries, or the merger or consolidation of rykoff or jpfi or any of their respective subsidiaries with or to any corporation or other entity other than as provided in the merger agreement, the option agreements or the support agreement (and the stockholders shall promptly notify jpfi of all of the relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which such stockholders may receive relating to any such matters). section 3. securities act covenants and representations. each -------------------------------------------- stockholder hereby agrees and represents to jpfi as follows: (a) such stockholder has been advised that the offering, sale and delivery of jpfi common stock pursuant to the merger will be registered under the securities act on a registration statement on form s-4. such stockholder has also been advised, however, that to the extent such stockholder is considered an "affiliate" of rykoff at the time the merger agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of rykoff any public offering or sale by such stockholder of any shares of jpfi common stock received by such stockholder in the merger will, under current law, require either (i) the further registration under the securities act of any shares of jpfi common stock to be sold by such stockholder, (ii) compliance with rule 145 promulgated by the sec under the securities act or (iii) the availability of another exemption from such registration under the securities act. (b) such stockholder has read this agreement and the merger agreement and has discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon such stockholder's ability -2- to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of jpfi common stock, to the extent such stockholder believed necessary, with such stockholder's counsel or counsel for rykoff. (c) such stockholder also understands that stop transfer instructions will be given to jpfi's transfer agent with respect to jpfi common stock and that a legend will be placed on the certificates for the jpfi common stock issued to such stockholder, or any substitutions therefor, to the extent such stockholder is considered an "affiliate" of rykoff at the time the merger agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of rykoff. section 4. pooling covenants and representations. each stockholder ------------------------------------- hereby agrees and represents to jpfi that such stockholder will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any securities of rykoff or of any shares of jpfi common stock received by such stockholder in the merger or other shares of capital stock of jpfi during the period beginning 30 days prior to the effective time and ending at such time as results covering at least 30 days of combined operations of rykoff and jpfi have been published by jpfi, in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement filed with the sec, a report to the sec on form 10-k, 10-q or 8-k, or any other public filing or announcement which includes the combined results of operations, except for transfers or other dispositions that, taking into account the actions of other affiliates of rykoff, will not prevent jpfi from accounting for the merger as a pooling of interests. section 5. further assurances. each of jpfi and the stockholders ------------------ shall execute and deliver such additional instruments and other documents and shall take such further actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, carry out and comply with all of its obligations under this agreement. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of jpfi or any of the stockholders shall enter into any agreement or arrangement (or alter, amend or terminate any existing agreement or arrangement) if such action would materially impair the ability of any party to effectuate, carry out or comply with all the terms of this agreement. section 6. representations and warranties of jpfi. jpfi represents -------------------------------------- and warrants to each stockholder as follows: each of this agreement and the merger agreement has been approved by the board of directors of jpfi, representing all -3- necessary corporate action on the part of jpfi other than approval of the merger agreement by the stockholders of jpfi. each of this agreement and the merger agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of jpfi. each of this agreement and the merger agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of jpfi, enforceable against jpfi in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may affect the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. jpfi covenants and agrees that, effective as of the effective time, jpfi shall assume the rights and obligations of rykoff under that certain registration rights agreement, dated as of may 17, 1996, by and among rykoff and the other persons whose signatures are set forth on the signature pages thereto pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to jpfi and such other persons. section 7. representations and warranties of stockholders. each ---------------------------------------------- stockholder represents and warrants to jpfi that this agreement (i) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such stockholder and (ii) constitutes the valid and binding agreement of such stockholder, enforceable against such stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may affect the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. each such stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the subject shares set forth opposite its respective name on schedule i. the subject shares listed next to the name of such stockholder on schedule i hereto are the only voting securities of rykoff owned (beneficially or of record) by such stockholder. neither the execution or delivery of this agreement nor the consummation by such stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate (a) the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other organizational document, as applicable, of any such stockholder, or (b) any provisions of any law, rule or regulation applicable to such stockholder or any contract or agreement to which such stockholder is a party, other than such violations described in the foregoing clause (b) as would not prevent or materially delay the performance by such stockholder of its obligations hereunder or impose any liability or obligation on jpfi. each stockholder agrees that, at or prior to the effective time, it shall represent to rykoff, jpfi or their respective counsel that, during the two-year period immediately following the effective time, it -4- shall not (other than incident or pursuant to an extraordinary transaction) sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of (or enter into an agreement to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of) shares of jpfi common stock equal to more than the lesser of (i) 25% or (ii) the shortfall percent, in each case of the shares of jpfi common stock received by it in the merger. the "shortfall percent" shall equal that percentage of the total number of shares of jpfi common stock issued in the merger as, when added to the following percentage of shares of jpfi common stock, shall equal 45%: 100% minus the sum of (i) the percent of shares of jpfi common stock issuable in the merger to the stockholders and (ii) the percent of shares of jpfi common stock issuable in the merger to any other persons that can be identified immediately prior to the merger as holding 5% or more of the total number of shares of rykoff common stock outstanding at such time (for which purposes shares held by a family of mutual funds shall, to the extent possible, be identified with separate funds within such family and, to the extent so separately identifiable, treated as separate stockholders). for purposes of the restriction on disposition of jpfi common stock pursuant to the foregoing representation, the shares of jpfi common stock held by the stockholders shall be aggregated, and the stockholders shall be regarded as a single stockholder. notwithstanding the foregoing, no stockholder shall be required to provide the representation described herein if, as a result of a change in law (including, without limitation, a change pursuant to treasury regulations that may be applied, by election or otherwise, to the merger), the facts intended to be reached by such representation are not a necessary condition for qualification of the merger under section 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. for purposes of this section 7, an "extraordinary transaction" means a merger, consolidation or other business combination, tender or exchange offer, share exchange, restructuring, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving jpfi, so long as any such transaction is not arranged as part of an overall plan to which such stockholder is a party and pursuant to which the merger is also being consummated. section 8. effectiveness and termination. it is a condition ----------------------------- precedent to the effectiveness of this agreement that the merger agreement shall have been executed and delivered and be in full force and effect. in the event the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect. upon such termination, except for any -5- rights any party may have in respect of any breach by any other party of its or his obligations hereunder, none of the parties hereto shall have any further obligation or liability hereunder. section 9. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) notices, etc. all notices, requests, demands or other ------------- communications required by or otherwise with respect to this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given to any party when delivered personally (by courier service or otherwise), when

(c) successors and assigns. this agreement shall be binding upon and ---------------------- shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including without limitation in the case of any corporate party hereto any corporate successor by merger or otherwise, and in the case of any individual party hereto any trustee, executor, heir, legatee or personal representative succeeding to the ownership of such party's subject shares or other securities subject to this agreement. notwithstanding any transfer of subject shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations under this agreement of the transferor.

(f) specific performance. the parties acknowledge that money damages -------------------- are not an adequate remedy for violations of this agreement and that any party may, in its sole discretion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this agreement or prevent any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief. (g) remedies cumulative. all rights, powers and remedies provided ------------------- under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. (h) no waiver. the failure of any party hereto to exercise any --------- right, power or remedy provided under this agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance. (i) no third-party beneficiaries. this agreement is not intended to ---------------------------- be for the benefit of and shall not be enforceable by any person or entity who or which is not a party hereto. -8- (j) jurisdiction. each party hereby irrevocably submits to the ------------ exclusive jurisdiction of the court of chancery in the state of delaware or the united states district court for the southern district of new york or any court of the state of new york located in the city of new york in any action, suit or proceeding arising in connection with this agreement, and agrees that any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such court (and waives any objection based on forum non conveniens or any other objection to venue ----- --- ---------- therein); provided, however, that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the -------- ------- purpose referred to in this paragraph (j) and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of said courts or in the states of delaware or new york other than for such purposes. each party hereto hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding.
