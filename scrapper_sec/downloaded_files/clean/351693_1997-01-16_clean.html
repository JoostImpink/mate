entitled to vote (together with any other shares of common stock that the member may become entitled to vote), for and in the name, place and stead of the member at any meeting of the holders of shares of common stock or any adjournments or postponements thereof or pursuant to any consent in lieu of a meeting, or otherwise, with respect only to the approval of the merger agreement (discussed below), the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and any matters related to or in conjunction with the merger (defined below) and any corporate action, the consummation of which would violate, frustrate the purposes of, prevent, or delay the con- summation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. pursuant to the agreement, each member of the group in his capacity as a stockholder, and not in his capacity as a director of the com- pany, has agreed to negotiate exclusively with parent and purchaser with regard to the acquisition of the company. in conjunction with the offer, the company, parent and purchaser executed an agreement and plan of merger dated january 6, 1997 (the "merger agreement"). the merger agreement provides, among other things, for the commencement of the offer by purchaser and further provides that, after the purchase of common stock pursuant to the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement, purchaser will be merged with and into the company with the company surviving the merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of parent (the "merger"). pursuant to the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (excluding shares owned, directly or indirectly, by the company, parent, purchaser or any other subsidiary of parent and shares owned by holders who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights under the delaware general corporation law) will be converted into the right to receive the offer price. effective upon payment by purchaser for the common stock pursuant to the offer, purchaser shall be entitled to designate the number of directors of the company, rounded up to the next whole number, that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the board (giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional directors pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement), and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by parent and purchaser (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. the company has agreed that it will take all action necessary to cause purchaser's designees to be elected or appointed to the board. a schedule 14d-9 and 14f-1 describing the agreement, the merger agreement and the director-designees, as well as other relevant information, have been filed with the securities and exchange commission and mailed to the company's stockholders. group members raymond h. hefner, jr., richard b. hefner and james r. tolbert, iii constitute three of five members of the board of directors of the company. at a special meeting of the board of directors held on january 6, 1997, the board unanimously adopted the merger agreement. in making its recommendation, the board of directors considered several factors including the company's past and present financial condition, reasonable expectations for future business, the market price of the company's common stock as traded over the last four quarters, the terms of the offer and merger agreement, the general accounting office's recent statement that the united states should use foreign oil and preserve domestic inventories and the decrease in rig count in the state of oklahoma for the present week from the previous week. the directors also noted that all stockholders were receiving the same price for their stock. except as set forth in this item 4, no member of the group has any plans or proposals which would relate to or result in any of the following: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company, or the disposition of securities of the company; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancy on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (f) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the company's charter, bylaws or

to as the "constituent corporations." whereas, the respective boards of directors of dlb, adi and the company have approved the acquisition of the company by dlb pursuant to the terms of this agreement; and whereas, in furtherance thereof adi will make a tender offer for all shares of the company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "common stock"), upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement; and whereas, the respective boards of directors of dlb, adi and the company have approved the merger of adi into the company (the "merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and whereas, in order to induce dlb and adi to enter into this agreement, certain holders of common stock (the "selling stockholders") have entered into a stockholder tender agreement with adi (the "stockholder agreement"), pursuant to which each such holder has agreed, among other things, to tender such holder's shares of common stock to adi pursuant to the offer (hereinafter defined) upon the terms and conditions set forth in such stockholder agreement. now, wherefore, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: article i. the tender offer 1.1. the offer. provided that nothing shall have occurred which would result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in annex a, attached hereto and made a part hereof, as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the fifth (5th) business day following the date hereof, adi shall commence a cash tender offer (the "offer") for all of the outstanding shares (the "shares") of the common stock at a price of thirty and no/100 dollars ($30.00) per share net to the seller in cash (the "price per share"), which offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in annex a hereto, and adi shall file a schedule 14d-1 with respect to the offer in accordance with rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). adi shall, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth on annex a hereto, accept for payment all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer as soon as practicable after such acceptance is legally permitted. notwithstanding the foregoing, adi expressly reserves the right to increase the price per share payable in the offer and make any other changes to the terms or conditions of the offer, provided, however, that adi will not, without the prior written consent of the company (such consent to be authorized by the board of directors of the company), (i) decrease the price per share, change the form of consideration payable in the offer or decrease the number of shares sought, (ii) change the conditions to the offer (other than to waive any condition), (iii) impose additional conditions to the offer or (iv) amend any other term of the offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares (other than insignificant changes or amendments). the offer shall expire at 12:00 midnight, new york city time, on the twentieth (20th) business day following commencement of the offer (such date and time, as may be extended in accordance with the terms hereof, is referred to as the "expiration date"); provided, however, and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that adi may, from time to time, in its sole discretion extend the expiration date, (w) to comply with applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission ("sec"); (x) if any of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied, for the minimum period of time necessary to satisfy such condition; (y) if all of the conditions to the offer have been satisfied but fewer than 90% of the shares of common stock outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) have been tendered in the offer, for the minimum period of time necessary until 90% of such shares have been so tendered, but in no event later than the tenth (10th) day following the initial expiration date; provided, however, that if adi extends the expiration date pursuant to the clause (y), it will be deemed upon such extension to have waived all conditions except (c), (d)(i) and (d)(iii) set forth on annex a hereto; or (z) if a tender or exchange offer for shares of common stock or any other proposal for a business combination involving the company shall be publicly disclosed or dlb or adi shall have otherwise learned that a tender or exchange offer for shares of common stock or any other proposal for a business combination involving the company shall have been made or publicly proposed to be made by any person (including the company, or any of its affiliates, or any group (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act)) (a "competing offer"), and all of the conditions to the offer have not been satisfied, until ten (10) days after the termination or publicly-announced abandonment of such competing offer, but in no event later than the minimum time necessary to satisfy all such conditions; provided, further, that in no event shall the expiration date be extended without the prior written consent of the company beyond the 21st day of march, 1997 unless condition (d) set forth in annex a to this agreement shall not then be satisfied. 1.2. company action. the company hereby consents to the offer and represents that its board of directors has unanimously approved the offer, the merger, this agreement, the stockholder agreement and the acquisition of shares of common stock pursuant thereto, and unanimously resolved to recommend acceptance of the offer and approval of the merger by the stockholders of the company. upon commencement of the offer, the company shall promptly file with the sec and mail to the holders of common stock a solicitation/recommendation statement on schedule 14d-9 reflecting such recommendation and shall permit adi to include a copy of such schedule 14d-9 in its offering documents, as such phrase is hereinafter defined. the company hereby consents to the inclusion in the offer of the recommendation referred to in the preceding sentence. in connection with the offer, the company will furnish adi with such information, including current lists of the stockholders of the company, mailing labels and lists of security positions, and such assistance as adi or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the offer to the company's stockholders. 1.3. board of directors of the company. effective upon the payment by adi for shares pursuant to the offer, adi will be entitled to designate that number of directors of the company, rounded up to the next whole number, that equals the product of (x) the total number of directors on the board of directors (giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional directors pursuant to this section 1.3) and (y) the percentage that the number of shares owned by dlb and adi (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of outstanding shares. the board of directors of the company will at all relevant times be composed of a sufficient number of directors so that the right of adi under this section 1.3 will not be impaired. the company will at such time cause the designees of adi to be elected to or appointed by the board of directors, including, without limitation, increasing the number of directors, amending its bylaws, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain resignations of incumbent directors, and, to the extent necessary, filing with the sec and mailing to its stockholders the information required by section 14(f) of the exchange act and the rules promulgated thereunder, as promptly as possible. dlb and adi will supply any information with respect to themselves and their respective
