agreed amount &#148;), then: (i) for claims which are agreed not to arise from special owned site environmental liabilities, the escrow agent shall release to mcc the number of company indemnity escrow shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the portion of the agreed amount allocable to the indemnifying company stockholders by the mcc stock price (determined as of the fourth business day preceding such release in accordance with section 4(g) hereof);

(c) if a dispute notice is delivered in accordance with section 4(b) of this agreement by the stockholders&#146; representative, then the amount of the claim less the agreed amount (if any) as released to mcc, shall be treated as a disputed claim (the &#147; disputed claim &#148;) and the escrow agent shall not release any company indemnity escrow shares, any special environmental escrow shares or any portion of the dlj indemnity escrow deposit to mcc, and, if prior to the maturity date, the amount of the dlj indemnity escrow deposit to be deposited on the maturity date shall not be reduced, in each case, in respect of such disputed claim, until the earlier to occur of (i) the escrow agent&#146;s receipt of a joint written direction executed by the stockholders&#146; representative and mcc with respect to such claim, the allocation of such losses between dlj and the indemnifying company stockholders and the allocation of such losses as special owned site environmental liabilities if applicable (a &#147; joint written instruction &#148;), or (ii) the escrow agent&#146;s receipt of a final, non-appealable judgment, order or decree of a court or other judicial body of competent jurisdiction that decided the underlying claim and the allocation of such losses with respect to such amount (the &#147; final judgment &#148;). the escrow agent may receive and conclusively rely upon an opinion of counsel to the effect that such final judgment is final, non-appealable and from a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) if either a joint written instruction or a final judgment with respect to any such disputed claim sets forth any dollar amount that is to be paid in favor of mcc (&#147; required amount &#148;), then: (i) for claims which are determined not to arise from special owned site environmental liabilities, to the extent the indemnifying company stockholders are liable for such losses, the escrow agent shall release to mcc from the general york escrow fund, within three (3) business days after escrow agent&#146;s receipt of such joint - 8 - written instruction or final judgment, the number of company indemnity escrow shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the portion of the required amount allocable to the indemnifying company stockholders in respect of such losses by the mcc stock price (determined as of the fourth business day preceding such release in accordance with section 4(g) hereof); (ii) for claims which are determined to arise from special owned site environmental liabilities, to the extent the indemnifying company stockholders are liable for such losses, (a) the escrow agent shall release to mcc from the special environmental escrow fund, within three (3) business days after escrow agent&#146;s receipt of such joint written instruction or final judgment, the number of special environmental escrow shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the portion of the required amount allocable to the indemnifying company stockholders in respect of such losses by the mcc stock price (determined as of the fourth business day preceding such release in accordance with section 4(g) hereof), and (b) to the extent the remaining amount of the special environmental escrow fund is insufficient to satisfy any such losses, the escrow agent shall release to mcc from the general york escrow fund, within three (3) business days after escrow agent&#146;s receipt of such joint written instruction or final judgment, the number of company indemnity escrow shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the dollar amount of such insufficiency by the mcc stock price (determined as of the fourth business day preceding such release in accordance with section 4(g) hereof);
