series e preferred stock &#8221;) in exchange for an aggregate of $20,524,149 of principal and accrued interest of certain debt previously owed by the issuer to h.i.g. aert.&#160;&#160;the 20,524.149 shares of series e convertible preferred stock are convertible into 273,655,320 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations, preferences and rights of the series e convertible preferred stock (the &#8220; certificate of designations &#8221;).&#160;&#160;below is a summary of the preferences, rights and privileges of the series e preferred stock. &#160; ranking &#160; the series&#160;e preferred stock ranks senior to all shares of capital stock of the issuer (the &#8220; junior stock &#8221;).&#160;&#160;without the prior express consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock, voting separately as a single class, the issuer is not authorized to issue any additional shares of capital stock that is senior or pari passu to the shares of series e preferred stock in preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the issuer. &#160; dividends &#160; dividends on the series e preferred stock accrue cumulatively on a daily basis during each quarter at a rate per annum of 6% of the stated value, which is equal to $1,000 per share of the series e preferred stock, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization, reorganizations, reclassifications, combinations, subdivisions or other similar events related to the series e preferred stock.&#160;&#160;&#160;

if after the date the shares of series e preferred stock are issued, the issuer issues any shares of common stock for consideration per share less than a price equal to the dollar volume-weighted average price of the common stock on &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; the otc bulletin board during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., new york time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., new york time, for the ten trading day period immediately prior to such issuance, the conversion price will be reduced to a price determined by multiplying the original conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding at such time (excluding shares owned by the issuer, shares of common stock issuable upon options and convertible securities not then exercisable, and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of series e preferred stock) (the &#8220; common stock deemed outstanding &#8221;), plus the number of shares of common stock that the consideration received by the issuer for such dilutive issuance would purchase at the closing price of the common stock on the date of issuance; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding immediately after such dilutive issuance. &#160; liquidation preference &#160; in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer, before any payment is made to the holders of junior stock, the holders of each share of series&#160;e preferred stock will be entitled to receive payment per share of series e preferred stock equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon or (ii)&#160;the amount per share such holder would receive if the holder converted the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock into common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer.&#160;&#160;after such payment, the holders of series e preferred stock are not entitled to any further participation in any distribution of the remaining assets of the issuer. &#160; redemption rights &#160; in the event that (i) the issuer fails to deliver the required number of shares of common stock within five trading days after the conversion date or payment of the buy-in price when due, or written notice to any holder of the series e preferred stock of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion of any shares of series e preferred stock, or (ii) any event of default occurs under any of the notes as specified in the series e exchange agreement (the &#8220; triggering event &#8221;), a holder of series e preferred stock is entitled to require the issuer to redeem all or any portion of the holder&#8217;s shares of series e preferred stock at a price per share equal to the greater of (x) $1,000 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and (y) the product of the conversion rate of 13,333 multiplied by the highest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such triggering event and ending on the date the issuer makes the entire payment required to be made. &#160; in the event of a merger, selling of all or substantial all of the issuer&#8217;s assets, allowing other persons to purchase more than 50% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the issuer, or a reorganization of the common stock, the holder of the series e preferred stock is entitled to require the issuer to redeem all or any portion of the holder&#8217;s shares of series e preferred stock at a price per share of series e preferred stock equal to $1,000 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. &#160; voting rights &#160; except as otherwise provided by law or as expressly contemplated by the certificate of designations, holders of series&#160;e preferred stock have the right to vote with the holders of common stock and the holders of any other capital stock entitled to vote as a single class on an &#8220;as converted&#8221; basis.&#160;&#160;in addition, the holders of series e preferred stock have the exclusive right, voting separately as a single class, to elect four of the seven directors of the issuer, if the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock represent at least twenty percent of the outstanding shares of common stock, calculated on an &#8220;as converted&#8221; basis.&#160;&#160;if the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock do not represent at least twenty percent of the outstanding shares of common stock, the holders of series e preferred stock have the right to elect one of the seven directors of the issuer. &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; protection provisions &#160; except as otherwise provided by law or contemplated by the certificate of designations, without first obtaining the affirmative vote of at least the majority of the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock, neither the issuer nor its subsidiaries are allowed to (i) create or issue shares of any additional class or series of capital stock unless the same ranks junior to the series e preferred stock with respect to the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer and the payment of dividends; (ii) create or issue shares of junior stock requiring redemption or repayment of such junior stock; (iii) issue any shares of series e preferred stock other than pursuant to the series e exchange agreement; (iv) amend any certificate of designations, which would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights or privileges of the series e preferred stock; (v) authorize any sale, merger, acquisition or liquidation of the issuer; (vi) amend the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation that would adversely alter the holders of series e preferred stock; (vii) increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting the board or any committee of the board; (viii) authorize anti-takeover provisions; (ix) amend, alter or repeal the preferences, privileges and rights of the series e preferred stock so as to affect adversely the series e preferred stock; (x) issue any indebtedness which exceeds $3,000,000 in the aggregate; (xi) take any other action that adversely affects the preferences, rights or privileges of the holders of the series e preferred stock; or (xii) circumvent a right of the series e preferred stock. &#160;

voting agreement &#8221;).&#160;&#160;pursuant to the voting agreement, h.i.g. aert and certain stockholders as specified in an exhibit to the voting agreement have agreed to vote to authorize, approve and ratify an amendment to the certificate of incorporation authorizing an additional 400,000,000 shares of common stock of the issuer for a total of 525,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. &#160; registration rights agreement &#160; concurrently with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the series d exchange agreement and series e exchange agreement, h.i.g. aert also entered into a registration rights agreement with the issuer, dated as of march 18, 2011 (the &#8220; registration rights agreement &#8221;).&#160;&#160;subject to customary terms and conditions set forth in the registration rights agreement, the issuer has agreed that h.i.g. aert will have certain demand registration rights and piggy-back registration rights with respect to shares of common stock that were issuable upon the conversion of series e preferred stock and the shares of common stock that were issued in exchange for shares of series d preferred stock and certain warrants, subject to certain limitations. &#160; the foregoing descriptions of the series d exchange agreement, series e exchange agreement, the voting agreement and the registration rights agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the agreements, which are filed as exhibits 2-5 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference. &#160;

consideration of various alternatives with respect to their investment, including possible changes in the present board of directors and/or management of the issuer or other alternatives to increase shareholder value. in addition, the reporting persons may acquire additional issuer securities in the public markets, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise or may determine to sell, trade or otherwise dispose of all or some holdings in the issuer in the public markets, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, or take any other lawful action they deem to be in their best interests. &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; except as set forth in this item 4, no reporting person has any present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the issuer, or the disposition of securities of the issuer;

(i) a class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act; or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated in subparagraphs (a)-(i) above. there is no assurance that the reporting persons will develop any plans or proposals with respect to any of these matters. however, the reporting persons reserve the right to formulate plans or proposals which would relate to or result in the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of this item 4. &#160; item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. &#160; (a) as of the date hereof, h.i.g. aert beneficially owns: (i) 15,289,890 shares of common stock, and (ii) 273,655,320 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of 20,524.149 shares of series e preferred stock (238,133,757 of which are subject to the effectiveness of the amendment (as defined below)).&#160;&#160;h.i.g. capital partners iv and h.i.g. bayside debt &amp; lbo fund ii each hold directly 45.5% and 33.3%, respectively, of the equity interests of h.i.g. aert.&#160;&#160;h.i.g. advisors iv is the general partner of h.i.g. capital partners iv.&#160;&#160;h.i.g. bayside advisors ii is the general partner of h.i.g. bayside debt &amp; lbo fund ii.&#160;&#160;h.i.g.- gpii. is the manager of each of h.i.g. advisors iv and h.i.g. bayside advisors ii.&#160;&#160;sami w. mnaymneh and anthony a tamer are co-presidents and directors of h.i.g.- gpii.&#160;&#160;h.i.g. capital partners iv, h.i.g. bayside debt &amp; lbo fund ii, h.i.g. advisors iv, h.i.g. bayside advisors ii, h.i.g.- gpii, sami w. mnaymneh and anthony a. tamer may therefore be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 15,289,890 shares of common stock owned by h.i.g. aert and the 273,655,320 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of 20,524.149 shares of series e preferred stock.&#160;&#160;other than h.i.g. aert, neither the filing of this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission by any of the reporting persons that it or he is the beneficial owner of any shares of common stock referred to herein for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act or for any other purpose.&#160;&#160;each of the reporting person, other than h.i.g. aert, disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock, except to the extent of its or his pecuniary interest in the shares of common stock. &#160; for purposes of this schedule 13d, the reporting persons based the number of outstanding ordinary shares on an aggregate of 87,363,907 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of march 18, 2011, as reported in the series e exchange agreement (including 15,289,890 shares of common stock of the issuer issued to h.i.g. aert pursuant to the series d exchange agreement), and 273,655,320 shares of common stock of the issuer issuable upon conversion of 20,524.149 shares of series e preferred stock issued to h.i.g. pursuant to the series e exchange agreement.&#160;&#160;&#8221;). &#160; of the total 273,655,320 shares of common stock into which the 20,524.149 shares of series e preferred stock are convertible, only 35,521,563 shares of common stock are currently reserved for issuance upon conversion of the series e preferred stock. at a meeting of the issuer&#8217;s stockholders to be held no later than july 15, 2011, the issuer is contractually obligated to present for stockholder approval an amendment to the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation to authorize an additional 400,000,000 shares of common stock (the &#8220; amendment &#8221;).&#160;&#160;contingent upon the effectiveness of the amendment, the issuer will reserve the remaining 238,133,757 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of series e preferred stock (the &#8220; unreserved shares &#8221;). for purposes of reporting their beneficial ownership in this schedule 13d, the reporting persons have assumed that the 238,133,757 unreserved shares have been reserved and authorized for issuance. if the reporting persons excluded the unreserved shares, they would be deemed to beneficially own 50,811,453 shares of common stock. exclusion of the unreserved shares would result in the reporting persons&#8217; beneficial ownership percentage being approximately 40.9%.&#160;&#160;the number of shares of common stock of the issuer issuable upon conversion of the series e preferred stock is subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designations of the series e preferred stock. &#160;

&#160; 34 &#160; a portable document format (.pdf) file of an executed signature page, such signature page shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such signature page were an original thereof. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; headings; gender . the headings of this agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this agreement. unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, each pronoun herein shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural forms thereof. the terms &#8220;including,&#8221; &#8220;includes,&#8221; &#8220;include&#8221; and words of like import shall be construed broadly as if followed by the words &#8220;without limitation.&#8221;&#160;&#160;the terms &#8220;herein,&#8221; &#8220;hereunder,&#8221; &#8220;hereof&#8221; and words of like import refer to this entire agreement instead of just the provision in which they are found. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; severability . if any provision of this agreement is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this agreement so long as this agreement as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties. the parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s). notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement or any other transaction document (and without implication that the following is required or applicable), it is the intention of the parties that in no event shall amounts and value paid by the company, or payable to or received by buyer, under the transaction documents (including without limitation, any amounts that would be characterized as &#8220;interest&#8221; under applicable law) exceed amounts permitted under any applicable law. accordingly, if any obligation to pay, payment made to buyer, or collection by buyer pursuant the transaction documents is finally judicially determined to be contrary to any such applicable law, such obligation to pay, payment or collection shall be deemed to have been made by mutual mistake of buyer and the company and such amount shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by the applicable law. such adjustment shall be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing or refunding, at the option of buyer, the amount of interest or any other amounts which would constitute unlawful amounts required to be paid or actually paid to buyer under the transaction documents. for greater certainty, to the extent that any interest, charges, fees, expenses or other amounts required to be paid to or received by buyer under any of the transaction documents or related thereto are held to be within the meaning of &#8220;interest&#8221; or another applicable term to otherwise be violative of applicable law, such amounts shall be pro-rated over the period of time to which they relate. &#160; (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

triggering event &#8221;: &#160; (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the corporation&#8217;s (a) failure to cure a conversion failure by delivery of the required number of shares of common stock within five&#160;(5)&#160;trading days after the applicable conversion date or payment of the buy-in price when due or (b) written notice to any holder (including, without limitation, by way of public announcement or through any of its agents) at any time of its intention not to comply, as required, with a request for conversion of any shares of series&#160;e preferred stock that is requested in accordance with the provisions of this certificate of designations; or &#160; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;any event of default (as defined in the notes) occurs under any of the notes. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notice of a triggering event; redemption right . upon the occurrence of any triggering event, the corporation shall within three&#160;(3)&#160;business days deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier (with next day delivery specified) (a &#8220; notice of triggering event &#8221;) to each holder. at any time after the earlier of a holder&#8217;s receipt of a notice of triggering event and such holder becoming aware of a triggering event, such holder may require the corporation to redeem all or any portion of such holder&#8217;s shares of series&#160;e preferred stock by delivering written notice thereof (the &#8220; triggering event redemption notice &#8221;) to the corporation, which triggering event redemption notice shall indicate the number of shares of series&#160;e preferred stock &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; that such holder is electing to redeem. in addition to all other rights of such holder contained herein, each share of series&#160;e preferred stock subject to redemption by the corporation pursuant to this section 5(b) shall be redeemed by the corporation at a price per share of series&#160;e preferred stock equal to the greater of (i)&#160;the conversion amount of such share of series&#160;e preferred stock and (ii)&#160;the product of (x) the conversion rate in effect at such time as such holder delivers a triggering event redemption notice with respect to such conversion amount of such share of series&#160;e preferred stock multiplied by (y) the highest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding such triggering event and ending on the date the corporation makes the entire payment required to be made under this section 5(b) (the &#8220; triggering event redemption price &#8221;). redemptions required by this section 5(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 9. to the extent redemptions required by this section 5(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock by the corporation, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. in the event of any triggering event resulting in the corporation&#8217;s redemption of any shares of series&#160;e preferred stock under this section 5(b), such holder&#8217;s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties&#8217; inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such holder. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 5(b)&#160;&#160;is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such holder&#8217;s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 5, until the triggering event redemption price is paid in full, all shares of series&#160;e preferred stock submitted for redemption under this section 5(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such holder into common stock pursuant to section 4, and upon such conversion the corporation&#8217;s obligations under this section 5(b) shall terminate with regard to all shares so converted. &#160;

50 &#160; respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect to the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to said shares were paid in full. to the extent necessary, the corporation shall cause such actions to be taken by any of its subsidiaries (as defined below) so as to enable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a liquidation event to be distributed to the holders in accordance with this section 6(a). all the preferential amounts to be paid to the holders under this section 6(a) shall be paid or set apart for payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for, or the distribution of any of the assets of the corporation available for distribution to the holders of junior stock in connection with a liquidation event as to which this section 6 applies. for purposes of this certificate of designations, a &#8220; liquidation event &#8221; means the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation or such subsidiaries the assets of which&#160;constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the business of the corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of transactions. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; distribution of remaining assets . upon a liquidation event, after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders, the holders will not be entitled to any further participation as such in any distribution of the remaining assets of the corporation as holders of shares of series&#160;e preferred stock. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; additional rights . in the event the requirements of this section 6 are not complied with, the corporation shall forthwith either (i)&#160;cause such liquidation event to be postponed until such time as the requirements of this section 6 have been complied with; or (ii)&#160;cancel such liquidation event, in which event the rights, powers, designations, preferences and privileges of the holders of the series&#160;e preferred stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, powers, designations, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the liquidation event. &#160;

shall be equal to (1) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the corporation with respect to one share of common stock upon the issuance or sale of the convertible security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such convertible security minus (2)&#160;the sum of all amounts paid or payable by, or for the benefit of, the corporation to the holder of such convertible security (or any other person) upon the issuance or sale of such convertible security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such convertible security (or any other person). except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of common stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such convertible securities, and if any such issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any options for which adjustment of the conversion price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 7(a), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the conversion price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. &#160; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; change in option price or rate of conversion . if the purchase or exercise price provided for in any options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any convertible securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock increases or decreases at any time, the conversion price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the conversion price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. for purposes of this section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any option or convertible security that was outstanding as of the initial issuance date are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such option or convertible security and the shares of common stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. no adjustment pursuant to this section 7(a) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the conversion price then in effect. &#160; (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; calculation of consideration received . if any option or convertible security is issued or deemed issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the corporation, together comprising one integrated transaction, (x)&#160;such option or convertible security (as applicable) will be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal to the black scholes consideration value thereof and (y)&#160;the other &#160; 53 &#160; securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal to the difference of (i) the aggregate consideration received by the corporation minus (ii) the black scholes consideration value of each such option or convertible security (as applicable). if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the gross amount received by the corporation therefor and not reduced by any standard and customary underwriter&#8217;s discounts or commissions, standard and customary selling agent commissions or expenses or other standard and customary reasonable expenses (but net of any amount or other consideration paid or payable to, or withheld by, any purchaser thereof or any of its affiliates). if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the corporation will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of&#160;publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the corporation for such securities will be the average vwap of such security for the five&#160;(5)&#160;trading day period immediately preceding the date of receipt. if any shares of common stock, options or convertible securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the corporation is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business (including goodwill) of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of common stock, options or convertible securities (as the case may be). the fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the corporation and the applicable holder. if such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten&#160;(10)&#160;days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the &#8220; valuation event &#8221;), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five&#160;(5)&#160;trading days after the tenth (10 th ) day following such valuation event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the corporation and such holder. the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the corporation. &#160; (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; record date . if the corporation takes a record of the holders of shares of common stock for the purpose of entitling them (a) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common stock, options or in convertible securities or (b) to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock, options or convertible securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of common stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). &#160; (vi)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; application . if a dilutive issuance occurs that results in an adjustment to the conversion price and the exercise price or conversion price (as the case may be) of any other options or convertible securities pursuant to the &#160; 54 &#160; express terms thereof, then the only adjustment that shall be made under this section 7(a) shall be the adjustment required to be made as a result of such dilutive issuance and no adjustment shall be made under this section 7(a) with respect to any such adjustment made as a result of such dilutive issuance to the exercise price or conversion price (as the case may be) of any such options or convertible securities. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; adjustment of conversion price upon subdivision or combination of common stock . without limiting any provision of section 7(a) or section 8, if the corporation at any time on or after the initial issuance date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. without limiting any provision of section 7(a) or section 8, if the corporation at any time on or after the initial issuance date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. any adjustment pursuant to this section 7(b) shall become&#160; effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. if any event requiring an adjustment under this section 7(b) occurs during the period that a conversion price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such conversion price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; other events . in the event that the corporation (or any subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect the holders from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the corporation&#8217;s board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the conversion price so as to protect the rights of the holders, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to section 7(c) will increase the conversion price as otherwise determined pursuant to this section 7, provided further that if any holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the corporation&#8217;s board of directors and such holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the corporation. &#160; 8.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; rights upon fundamental transaction . &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; receipt of consideration . prior to the consummation of any fundamental transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of common stock, the corporation shall make appropriate provision to insure that each holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock held by such holder: (i)&#160;in addition to the shares of common stock receivable upon such &#160; 55 &#160; conversion, such securities or other assets to which such holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of common stock had such shares of common stock been held by such holder upon the consummation of such fundamental transaction or (ii)&#160;in lieu of the shares of common stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the consummation of such fundamental transaction in such amounts as such holder would have been entitled to receive had the series&#160;e preferred stock held by such holder initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of common stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the conversion rate. provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the required holders. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notice of a fundamental transaction; redemption right . no later than ten&#160;(10)&#160;trading days prior to the consummation of a fundamental transaction, the corporation shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to each holder (a &#8220; fundamental transaction notice &#8221;). at any time during the period beginning after a holder&#8217;s receipt of a fundamental transaction notice or such holder becoming aware of a fundamental transaction if a fundamental transaction notice is not delivered to such holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence (as&#160; applicable) and ending on the later of twenty (20) trading days after (a) consummation of such fundamental transaction or (b) the date of receipt of such fundamental transaction notice, such holder may require (other than with respect to a fundamental transaction that occurs solely as a result of clause (i)(5)&#160;of the definition thereof) the corporation to redeem all or any portion of such holder&#8217;s shares of series&#160;e preferred stock by delivering written notice thereof (&#8220; fundamental transaction redemption notice &#8221;) to the corporation, which fundamental transaction redemption notice shall indicate the number of shares of series&#160;e preferred stock that such holder is electing to redeem. each share of series&#160;e preferred stock subject to redemption pursuant to this section 8(b) shall be redeemed by the corporation in cash at a price per share of series&#160;e preferred stock equal to the conversion amount thereof (the &#8220; fundamental transaction redemption price &#8221;). redemptions required by this section 8(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 9 and shall have priority to payments to stockholders of junior stock in connection with such fundamental transaction. to the extent redemptions required by this section 8(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock by the corporation, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. in the event of a fundamental transaction resulting in the corporation&#8217;s redemption of any portion of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock under this section 8(b), such holder&#8217;s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties&#8217; inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such holder. accordingly, any redemption premium due under this section 8(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of such holder&#8217;s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 8(b), until the fundamental transaction redemption price is paid in full, the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock submitted by such holder for redemption under this section 8(b) may be converted, in whole or in part, by such holder pursuant to section 4 into common stock or in the event &#160; 56 &#160; the conversion date is after the consummation of such fundamental transaction, common stock, securities and/or other assets (as applicable) as contemplated by section 8(a), and upon such conversion the corporation&#8217;s obligations under this section 8(b) shall terminate with regard to all shares so converted. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; application . the provisions of this section 8 shall apply similarly and equally to successive fundamental transactions. &#160; 9.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; redemptions by holders . &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; mechanics . the corporation shall deliver the applicable triggering event redemption price to the applicable holder in cash within three&#160;(3)&#160;business days after the corporation&#8217;s receipt of the applicable holder&#8217;s triggering event redemption notice. if a holder has submitted a fundamental transaction redemption notice in accordance with section 8(b), the corporation shall deliver the applicable fundamental transaction redemption price to such holder in cash concurrently with the consummation of such fundamental transaction if such notice is received at least one (1) business day prior to the consummation of such fundamental transaction and within three&#160;(3)&#160;business days after the corporation&#8217;s receipt of such notice otherwise. in the event that the corporation does not pay the applicable redemption price to the applicable holder within the time period required, at any time thereafter and until the corporation pays such unpaid redemption price in full, the applicable holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the corporation to promptly return to such holder any or all of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock that were submitted for redemption by such holder and for which the applicable redemption price has not been paid. upon the corporation&#8217;s receipt of such notice, (x)&#160;the applicable redemption notice shall be null and void with respect to the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock specified in such notice and (y)&#160;the corporation shall immediately return the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock specified in such notice to the applicable holder. a holder&#8217;s delivery of a notice voiding a redemption notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the corporation&#8217;s obligations to make any payments of interest which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the applicable redemption amount subject to such notice. interest shall accrue at the rate of 1% per month (prorated for partial months) on all redemption amounts that are not paid when due until such redemption amounts are paid in full and the corporation shall pay such accrued interest to the applicable holder at the time the applicable redemption amount is paid in full to such holder. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; notice of redemptions . upon the corporation&#8217;s receipt of any redemption notice from any of the holders, the corporation shall immediately, but no later than three&#160;(3)&#160;business days after its receipt thereof, forward to each of the other holders by facsimile a copy of such notice. if the corporation receives more than one&#160;(1)&#160;redemption notice during the seven&#160;(7)&#160;business day period beginning on and including the date of the corporation&#8217;s receipt of the first redemption notice and the corporation is unable to redeem all of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock designated in all redemption notices received during such seven&#160;(7)&#160;business day period, then the corporation shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder from who the corporation received redemption notices during such seven&#160;(7)&#160;business day period based on the &#160; &#160; 57 &#160; number of shares of series&#160;e preferred stock submitted for redemption pursuant to such redemption notices by each such holder relative to the aggregate number of shares of series&#160;e preferred stock submitted for redemption pursuant to such redemption notices. &#160; 10.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; rights upon issuance of purchase rights . in addition to any adjustments pursuant to section 7 above, if at any time the corporation grants, issues or sells any options, convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all the record holders of any class of common stock (the &#8220; purchase rights &#8221;), then each holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such purchase rights, the aggregate purchase rights which such holder could have acquired if such holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the shares of series&#160;e preferred stock held by such holder immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such purchase rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of common stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such purchase rights. &#160; 11.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; voting rights . &#160; (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; general . the holders of series&#160;e preferred stock shall be entitled to written notice of all meetings of stockholders or written consents (and copies of proxy materials and other information sent to stockholders) in accordance with the corporation&#8217;s bylaws (the &#8220; bylaws &#8221;) and the dgcl. on any matter (other than the election of the series&#160;e directors, which is addressed by section 11(b) hereof) presented to the stockholders of the corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), the holders of outstanding shares of series&#160;e preferred stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of series&#160;e preferred stock would be convertible under the circumstances described in section 4 hereof on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the common stock. except as provided by law or as expressly contemplated by the other provisions of this certificate of designations (including, without limitation, sections 11(b) and 11(c) below), holders of series&#160;e preferred stock shall vote together with the holders of common stock and the holders of any other capital stock entitled to vote on such matters as a single class. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; election of directors . in addition to the voting rights provided in section 11(a), the holders of series&#160;e preferred stock shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a single class, to elect (i) for so long as there remain outstanding shares of series e preferred stock representing at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of common stock (calculated assuming that the preferred stock is then fully converted into shares of common stock at the then-prevailing applicable conversion price), four (4) of the corporation&#8217;s seven (7) directors and (ii) for as long as any shares of series&#160;e preferred stock remain outstanding but such outstanding shares of series e preferred stock do not satisfy the provisions of clause (i) above, one (1) of the corporation&#8217;s seven (7) directors (such directors elected pursuant to this sentence are referred to herein as the &#8220; series&#160;e directors &#8221;).&#160;&#160;each committee of the board shall &#160; 58 &#160; include at least one&#160;(1)&#160;series&#160;e director. all series&#160;e directors shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the required holders either at meetings of stockholders at which directors are elected, a special meeting of holders of series&#160;e preferred stock or by written consent without a meeting in accordance with the dgcl. each series&#160;e director so elected shall serve for a term of one&#160;(1)&#160;year and until such series&#160;e director&#8217;s successor is elected and qualified, subject to such series&#160;e director&#8217;s earlier death, resignation or removal. any vacancy in the position of a series&#160;e director may be filled only by the holders of the series&#160;e preferred stock. each series&#160;e director may, during such series&#160;e director&#8217;s term of office, be removed at any time, with or without cause, by and only by the affirmative vote, at a special meeting of holders of series&#160;e preferred stock called for such purpose, or written consent without a meeting in accordance with the dgcl, of the required holders. any vacancy created by such removal may also be filled at such meeting or by such consent. &#160;

(ii) &#160; priority in demand registrations . if a demand registration involves an underwritten offering, and the sole or lead managing underwriter (as the case may be) of such underwritten offering shall advise the company in writing (with a copy to each investor requesting registration) on or before the date five (5) days prior to the date then scheduled for such offering that, in its opinion, the amount of registrable securities, if any, requested to be included in such demand registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the required investors of the registration (such writing to state the basis of such opinion and the approximate number of registrable securities which may be included in such offering), the company shall include in such demand registration, to the extent of the number which the company is so advised may be included in such offering without such effect, the registrable securities requested to be included in the demand registration by the investors, allocated pro rata among the investors based on the number of registrable securities held by each investor (on an as converted, fully-diluted basis and without giving effect to any exercise or conversion limitations contained in any such convertible or exercisable securities held by any such party and without regard to whether such securities are then convertible or exercisable). in the event the company shall not, by virtue of this section 2(a)(ii), include in any demand registration all of the registrable securities of any investor requesting to be included in such demand registration, such investor may, upon written notice to the company given within five (5) days of the time such investor first is notified of such matter, reduce the amount of registrable securities it desires to have included in such demand registration, whereupon only the registrable securities, if any, it desires to have included will be so included and the investors not so reducing shall be entitled to a corresponding increase in the amount of registrable securities to be included in such demand registration. &#160; (iii) &#160; limitations on registrations . the rights of investors of registrable securities to request demand registrations pursuant to section 2(a)(i) are subject to the following limitations: &#160; (1) &#160; in no event shall the company be required to effect a demand registration unless the reasonably anticipated aggregate offering price to the &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; public of all registrable securities for which registration has been requested by investors, together with any shares sold by the company for its own account, will be at least $1,000,000 or, if the foregoing is not satisfied, all of the registrable securities held by the investors requiring registration are included in the demand registration; and &#160; (2) &#160; in no event shall the company be required to effect, in the aggregate, more than one (1) demand registration in any twelve (12) month period involving an underwritten offering; provided, however, (x) such number shall be increased to the extent the company does not include in what would otherwise be the final registration the number of registrable securities requested to be registered by the investors by reason of section 2(a)(ii) and (y) there is no limitation on the number of demand registrations that will be shelf registrations. &#160; (iv) &#160; underwriting . notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 2(a)(i), if the applicable required investors of the registration elect, the offering of such registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten offering and such required investors of the registration may require that all persons (including other investors) participating in such registration sell their registrable securities to the underwriters at the same price and on the same terms of underwriting applicable to the required investors of the registration. if any demand registration involves an underwritten offering, the sole or managing underwriters and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with such registration shall be selected by the required investors of the registration, subject to the approval of the company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). &#160; (v) &#160; other registrations . during the period (i) beginning on the date of a request and (ii) ending on the date that is ninety (90) days after the date that a demand registration statement filed pursuant to such request has been declared effective by the sec or, if the required investors of the registration shall withdraw such request or such demand registration statement, on the date of such withdrawn request or such withdrawn registration statement, the company shall not, without the consent of the required investors of the registration, file a registration statement pertaining to any other securities of the company (other than a registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a company employee stock or similar plan on form s-8 or a&#160;&#160;registration statement relating solely to an acquisition or business combination to which the company is a party filed on form s-4). &#160; (vi) &#160; registration statement form . registrations under this section 2(a) shall be on such appropriate and available registration form of the sec (i) as shall be selected by the required investors of the registration and (ii) which shall be available for the sale of registrable securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified in the requests for registration. the company agrees to include in any such registration statement all information which any selling investor, upon advice of counsel, shall reasonably request. &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; (b) &#160; piggyback registration . &#160; (i) &#160; right to include registrable securities . &#160; (1) &#160; if the company at any time proposes to register any of its securities under the 1933 act (other than in a registration on form s-4 or s-8 or any successor form to such forms) whether or not pursuant to registration rights granted to other holders of its securities and whether or not for sale for its own account, the company shall deliver prompt written notice (which notice shall be given at least ten (10) trading days prior to such proposed registration and which notice shall be given after the company has publicly disclosed such proposed registration) to all investors of registrable securities of its intention to undertake such registration, describing in reasonable detail the proposed registration and distribution (including the anticipated range of the proposed offering price, the class and number of securities proposed to be registered and the distribution arrangements) and of such investors&#8217; right to participate in such registration under this section 2(b) as hereinafter provided. subject to the other provisions of this section 2(b)(i) and section 2(b)(ii), upon the written request of any investor made within twenty (20) calendar days after the receipt of such written notice (which request shall specify the amount of registrable securities to be registered and the intended method of disposition thereof), the company shall effect the registration under the 1933 act of all registrable securities requested by investors to be so registered&#160;&#160;(a &#8220; piggyback registration &#8221;), to the extent requisite to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the registrable securities so to be registered, by inclusion of such registrable securities in the registration statement which covers the securities which the company proposes to register and shall cause such registration statement to become and remain effective with respect to such registrable securities in accordance with the registration procedures set forth in section 3. if a piggyback registration involves an underwritten offering, immediately upon notification to the company from the underwriter of the price at which such securities are to be sold, the company shall so advise each participating investor. the investors requesting inclusion in a piggyback registration may, at any time prior to the effective date of the piggyback registration statement (and for any reason), revoke such request by delivering written notice to the company revoking such requested inclusion. &#160; (2) &#160; if at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the piggyback registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each investor and, thereupon, (a) in the case of a determination not to register, the company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses incurred in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of investors to cause such registration to be effected as a &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; registration under section 2(a), and (b) in the case of a determination to delay such registration, the company shall be permitted to delay the registration of such registrable securities for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities; provided, however, if such delay shall extend beyond 120 days from the date the company received a request to include registrable securities in such piggyback registration, then the company shall again give all investors the opportunity to participate therein and shall follow the notification procedures set forth in the preceding paragraph. there is no limitation on the number of such piggyback registrations pursuant to this section 2(b) which the company is obligated to effect. &#160; (3) &#160; the registration rights granted pursuant to the provisions of this section 2(b) shall be in addition to the registration rights granted pursuant to the other provisions of this section 2. &#160; (ii) &#160; priority in piggyback registration . if a piggyback registration involves an underwritten offering (on a firm commitment basis), and the sole or the lead managing underwriter (as the case may be) of such underwritten offering shall advise the company in writing (with a copy to each investor requesting registration) on or before the date five (5) days prior to the date then scheduled for such offering that, in its opinion, the amount of securities (including registrable securities) requested to be included in such registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in such offering without materially interfering with the successful marketing of the securities being offered (such writing to state the basis of such opinion and the approximate number of such securities which may be included in such offering without such effect), the company shall include in such registration, to the extent of the number which the company is so advised may be included in such offering without such effect, (i) in the case of a registration initiated by the company, (a) first , the securities that the company proposes to register for its own account, (b) second , the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the investors, allocated pro rata in proportion to the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by each of them, and (c) third , other securities of the company to be registered on behalf of any other person, and (ii) in the case of a registration initiated by a person other than the company, (a) first , the securities proposed to be registered by any persons initiating such registration, allocated pro rata in proportion to the number of securities requested to be included in such registration by each of them and (b) second , the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by the investors, allocated pro rata in proportion to the number of securities requested to be included in such registration by each of them, provided that in the event the company will not, by virtue of this section 2(b)(ii), include in any such registration all of the registrable securities of any investor requested to be included in such registration, such investor may, upon written notice to the company given within three (3) days of the time such investor first is notified of such matter, reduce the amount of registrable securities it desires to have included in such registration, whereupon only the registrable securities, if any, it desires to have included will be so included and the investors not so reducing shall be entitled to a corresponding increase in the amount of registrable securities to be included in such registration. &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; (iii) &#160; selection of underwriters . if any piggyback registration involves an underwritten offering, the sole or managing underwriter(s) and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with such registration shall be subject to the approval of the required investors of the registration (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). &#160; (c) &#160; registration of other securities . whenever the company shall effect a demand registration, no securities other than the registrable securities shall be covered by such registration unless (a) the required investors of the registration shall have consented in writing to the inclusion of such other securities and (b) no investor is unable to include any of its registrable securities requested for inclusion in such registration by reason of section 2(a)(ii). &#160; (d) &#160; underwritten offerings . &#160; (i) &#160; demand underwritten offerings .&#160;&#160;if requested by the sole or lead managing underwriter for any underwritten offering effected pursuant to a demand registration, the company shall enter into a customary underwriting agreement with the underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to the required investors of the registration and to contain such representations and warranties by the company and such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type, including, without limitation, indemnification and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in sections 6 and 7. &#160; (ii) &#160; investors of registrable securities to be parties to underwriting agreement .&#160;&#160;the investors holding the registrable securities to be distributed by underwriters in an underwritten offering contemplated by section 2 shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between the company and such underwriters and may, at such investors&#8217; option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such investors of registrable securities and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such investors of registrable securities; provided, however, the company shall not be required to make any representations or warranties with respect to written information specifically provided by a selling investor for inclusion in the registration statement.&#160;&#160;no investor shall be required to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements with, the company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such investor, such investor&#8217;s registrable securities and such investor&#8217;s intended method of disposition. &#160; (iii) &#160; participation in underwritten registration .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in this section 2, no person may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell its securities on the same terms and conditions provided in any underwritten arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangement and (ii) accurately completes and executes in a timely manner all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, custody &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; agreements, underwriting agreements and other documents customary for such an offering and reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. &#160; (e) &#160; allocation of registrable securities . the initial number of registrable securities included in any registration statement and any increase in the number of registrable securities included therein shall first be allocated pro rata among the investors based on the number of registrable securities held by each investor at the time such registration statement is declared effective by the sec. in the event that an investor sells or otherwise transfers any of such investor&#8217;s registrable securities, each transferee that becomes an investor shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of registrable securities included in such registration statement for such transferor. any shares of common stock included in a registration statement and which remain allocated to any person which ceases to hold any registrable securities covered by such registration statement shall be allocated to the remaining investors, pro rata based on the number of registrable securities then held by such investors&#160;&#160;which are covered by such registration statement. &#160; (f) &#160; legal counsel . subject to section 5 hereof, buyer shall have the right to select one (1) legal counsel to review and oversee, solely on its behalf, any registration pursuant to this section 2 (&#8220; legal counsel &#8221;), which shall be paul, hastings, janofsky &amp; walker llp or such other counsel as thereafter designated by buyer in writing. &#160; (g) &#160; use of form s-3 . the company shall undertake to register the resale of all the registrable securities on form s-3 as soon as such form is available for a primary offering with respect to any shelf registration statement, provided that the company shall maintain the effectiveness of all shelf registration statements then in effect until such time as a shelf registration statement on form s-3 covering the resale of all the registrable securities has been declared effective by the sec and the prospectus contained therein is available for use. &#160; (h) &#160; sufficient number of shares registered . in the event the number of shares available under any shelf registration statement is insufficient to cover all of the registrable securities required to be covered by such shelf registration statement or an investor&#8217;s allocated portion of the registrable securities pursuant to section 2(j), the company shall amend such shelf registration statement (if permissible), or file with the sec a new shelf registration statement (on the short form available therefor, if applicable), or both, so as to cover at least the required shelf registration amount as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new shelf registration statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the necessity therefor arises (but taking account of any staff position with respect to the date on which the staff will permit such amendment to the shelf registration statement and/or such new shelf registration statement (as the case may be) to be filed with the sec). the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment to such shelf registration statement and/or such new shelf registration statement (as the case may be) to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof with the sec, but in no event later than the applicable effectiveness deadline for such shelf registration statement. for purposes of the foregoing provision, the number of shares available under a shelf registration statement shall be deemed &#8220;insufficient to cover all of the registrable securities&#8221; if at any time the number of shares of common stock available for resale under the applicable shelf registration statement is less than the product determined by &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; multiplying (i) the required shelf registration amount as of such time by (ii) 0.90. the calculation set forth in the foregoing sentence shall be made without regard to any limitations on conversion of the preferred stock (and such calculation shall assume that the preferred stock is then fully convertible into shares of common stock at the then-prevailing applicable conversion price). &#160; (i) &#160; effect of failure to file and obtain and maintain effectiveness of any registration statement . if (i) a registration statement covering the resale of all of the registrable securities required to be covered thereby (disregarding any reduction pursuant to section 2(j)) and required to be filed by the company pursuant to this agreement is (a) not filed with the sec on or before the filing deadline for such registration statement (a &#8220; filing failure &#8221;) (it being understood that if the company files a registration statement without affording each investor the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required by section 3(c) hereof, the company shall be deemed to not have satisfied this clause (i)(a) and such event shall be deemed to be a filing failure) or (b) not declared effective by the sec on or before the effectiveness deadline for such registration statement (an &#8220; effectiveness failure &#8221;) (it being understood that if on the business day immediately following the effective date for such registration statement the company shall not have filed a &#8220;final&#8221; prospectus for such registration statement with the sec under rule 424(b) in accordance with section 3(b) (whether or not such a prospectus is technically required by such rule), the company shall be deemed to not have satisfied this clause (i)(b) and such event shall be deemed to be an effectiveness failure), (ii) other than during an allowable grace period (as defined below), on any day after the effective date of a registration statement sales of all of the registrable securities required to be included on such registration statement (disregarding any reduction pursuant to section 2(j)) cannot be made pursuant to such registration statement (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such registration statement effective, a failure to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such registration statement, a suspension or delisting of (or a failure to timely list) the shares of common stock on the principal market (as defined in the securities agreement), or a failure to register a sufficient number of shares of common stock or by reason of a stop order) or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use for any reason (a &#8220; maintenance failure &#8221;), or (iii) if a registration statement is not effective for any reason or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use for any reason, the company fails to file with the sec, any required reports under section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 act (as defined below) such that it is not in compliance with rule 144(c)(1) (or rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) (a &#8220; current public information failure &#8221;)&#160;&#160;as a result of which any of the investors are unable to sell registrable securities without restriction under rule 144 (including, without limitation, volume restrictions), then, as partial relief for the damages to any holder by reason of any such delay in, or reduction of, its ability to sell the underlying shares of common stock (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies available at law or in equity), the company shall pay to each holder of registrable securities relating to such registration statement an amount in cash equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate stated value (as defined in the certificate of designation (as defined in the securities agreement)) of all of such investor&#8217;s preferred stock on the closing date (or if such failure relates to only a portion of the registrable securities, then only with respect to the investor&#8217;s allocable cash investment with respect to the security that is exercisable or convertible (as the case may be) into such portion of such registrable securities) (1) on the date of such filing failure, effectiveness failure, maintenance failure or current public information failure, &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; as applicable, and (2) on every thirty (30) day anniversary of (i) a filing failure until such filing failure is cured; (ii) an effectiveness failure until such effectiveness failure is cured; (iii) a maintenance failure until such maintenance failure is cured; and (iv) a current public information failure until the earlier of (i) the date such current public information failure is cured and (ii) such time that such public information is no longer required pursuant to rule 144 (in each case, pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty (30) days). the payments to which a holder of registrable securities shall be entitled pursuant to this section 2(i) are referred to herein as &#8220; registration delay payments .&#8221; following the initial registration delay payment for any particular event or failure (which shall be paid on the date of such event or failure, as set forth above), without limiting the foregoing, if an event or failure giving rise to the registration delay payments is cured prior to any thirty (30) day anniversary of such event or failure, then such registration delay payment shall be made on the third (3 rd ) business day after such cure. in the event the company fails to make registration delay payments in a timely manner in accordance with the foregoing, such registration delay payments shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. &#160; (j) &#160; offering . notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, but subject to the payment of the registration delay payments pursuant to section 2(i), in the event the staff of the sec (the &#8220; staff &#8221;) or the sec seeks to characterize any&#160;offering pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement as constituting an&#160;offering of securities by, or on behalf of, the company, or in any other manner, such that&#160;the staff or&#160;the sec do not&#160;permit such shelf registration statement to become effective and used for resales in a manner that does not constitute such an offering and that permits the continuous resale at the market by the investors participating&#160;therein&#160;(or as otherwise may be acceptable to each investor) without being named therein as an &#8220;underwriter,&#8221; then the company shall reduce the number of shares to be included in such shelf registration statement by all investors until such time as the staff&#160;and the sec shall so permit such shelf registration statement to become effective as aforesaid.&#160;in making such reduction, the company shall reduce the number of shares to be included by all investors on a pro rata basis (based upon the number of registrable securities otherwise required to be included for each investor) unless the inclusion of shares by a particular investor or a particular set of investors are resulting in the staff or the sec&#8217;s &#8220;by or on behalf of the company&#8221; offering position, in which event the shares held by such investor or set of investors shall be the only shares subject to reduction (and if by a set of investors on a pro rata basis by such investors or on such other basis as would result in the exclusion of the least number of shares by all such investors).&#160; in addition, in the event that the staff or the sec requires any investor seeking to&#160;sell securities under a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement&#160;to be specifically identified as an&#160;&#8220;underwriter&#8221;&#160;in order to permit such shelf registration statement to become effective, and such investor does not consent to being so named as an underwriter in such registration statement,&#160;then, in each such case, the company&#160;shall reduce the total number of registrable securities to be registered on behalf of&#160;such&#160;investor,&#160;until such time as the staff or the sec does not require such identification or until such investor accepts such identification and the manner thereof.&#160;any reduction pursuant to this paragraph will&#160;first reduce all registrable securities other than those issued pursuant to the securities agreement.&#160;in the event of any&#160;reduction in registrable securities pursuant to this paragraph,&#160;an affected investor shall have the right to require, upon delivery of a written request to the company signed by such investor, the company to file a registration statement within thirty (30) days of such request (subject to any restrictions imposed by rule 415 or required&#160;by &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; the&#160;staff or the sec) for resale by such investor in a manner acceptable to such investor, and in a manner that the company and such investor reasonably believe to be permitted in light of the sec&#8217;s or staff&#8217;s previously enunciated positions referenced above, and the company shall following such request&#160;cause to be and keep effective such registration statement in the same manner as otherwise contemplated&#160;in this agreement for&#160;registration statements hereunder, in each case until such time as: (i) all registrable securities held by such investor&#160;have been registered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement in a manner acceptable to such investor&#160;or (ii) such investor agrees to be named as an underwriter in any such registration statement in a manner acceptable to such investor as to all registrable securities held by such investor and that have not theretofore been included in a registration statement under this agreement (it being understood that the special demand right under this sentence may be exercised by an investor multiple times and with respect to limited amounts of registrable securities in order to permit the resale thereof by such investor as contemplated above). &#160; 3.&#160;&#160; related obligations . &#160; whenever the company is required to effect the registration of registrable securities under the 1933 act pursuant to section 2 of this agreement, the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto, and the company shall have the following obligations: &#160; (a) &#160; the company shall promptly prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to all the registrable securities required to be covered by such registration statement (but in no event later than the applicable filing deadline) and use its&#160;&#160;reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing (but in no event later than the effectiveness deadline). subject to allowable grace periods, the company shall keep each registration statement effective (and the prospectus contained therein available for use) (and if such offering is under a shelf registration statement, such effectiveness shall be pursuant to rule 415 for resales by the holders on a delayed or continuous basis at then-prevailing market prices (and not fixed prices)) at all times until (i) if such registration statement is not a shelf registration statement, one hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date of such registration statement or (ii) if such registration statement is a shelf registration statement, the date on which the holders shall have sold all of the registrable securities covered by such shelf registration statement (as applicable) (the &#8220; registration period &#8221;). notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the company shall ensure that, when filed and at all times while effective, each registration statement (including, without limitation, all amendments and supplements thereto) and the prospectus (including, without limitation, all amendments and supplements thereto) used in connection with such registration statement (1) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of prospectuses, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading and (2) will disclose (whether directly or through incorporation by reference to other sec filings to the extent permitted) all material information regarding the company and its securities. the company shall submit to the sec, within one (1) business day after the later of the date that (i) the company learns that no review of a particular registration statement will be made by the staff or that the staff has no further comments on a particular &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; registration statement (as the case may be) and (ii) the consent of legal counsel is obtained pursuant to section 3(c) (which consent shall be immediately sought), a request for acceleration of effectiveness of such registration statement to a time and date not later than forty-eight (48) hours after the submission of such request. each shelf registration statement shall contain (except if otherwise directed by the required investors of the registration) the &#8220; selling stockholder &#8221; and the &#8220; plan of distribution &#8221; sections in substantially the form attached hereto as exhibit b . &#160; (b) &#160; subject to section 3(r) of this agreement, the company shall prepare and file with the sec such amendments (including, without limitation, post-effective amendments) and supplements to each registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with each such registration statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 act, as may be necessary to keep each such registration statement effective at all times during the registration period for such registration statement, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the 1933 act with respect to the disposition of all registrable securities of the company required to be covered by such registration statement until such time as all of such registrable securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such registration statement; provided, however, by 8:30 a.m. (new york time) on the business day immediately following each effective date, the company shall file with the sec in accordance with rule 424(b) under the 1933 act the final prospectus to be used in connection with sales pursuant to the applicable registration statement (whether or not such a prospectus is technically required by such rule). in the case of amendments and supplements to any registration statement which are required to be filed pursuant to this agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to this section 3(b)) by reason of the company filing a report on form 10-q or form 10-k or any analogous report under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;

(m) &#160; if requested by an investor, the company shall as soon as practicable after receipt of notice from such investor and subject to section 3(r) hereof, (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as an investor reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale and distribution of registrable securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of registrable securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the registrable securities to be sold in such offering; (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; and (iii) supplement or make amendments to any registration statement or prospectus contained therein if reasonably requested by an investor holding any registrable securities. &#160; (n) &#160; the company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registrable securities covered by a registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities. &#160; (o) &#160; the company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with, and in the manner provided by, the provisions of rule 158 under the 1933 act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the company&#8217;s fiscal quarter next following the applicable effective date of each registration statement. &#160;

(r) &#160; notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to the last sentence &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; of this section 3(r)), at any time after the effective date of a particular registration statement, the company may delay the disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the company or any of its subsidiaries the disclosure of which at the time is not, in the good faith opinion of the board of directors of the company, in the best interest of the company and, in the opinion of counsel to the company, otherwise required (a &#8220; grace period &#8221;), provided that the company shall promptly notify the investors in writing of the (i) existence of material, non-public information giving rise to a grace period (provided that in each such notice the company shall not disclose the content of such material, non-public information to any of the investors) and the date on which such grace period will begin and (ii)&#160;date on which such grace period ends, provided further that (i) no grace period shall exceed fifteen (15) consecutive days and during any three hundred sixty five (365) day period all such grace periods shall not exceed an aggregate of forty-five (45) days, (ii) the first day of any grace period must be at least five (5) trading days after the last day of any prior grace period and (iii) no grace period may exist during the sixty (60) trading day period immediately following the effective date of such registration statement (provided that such sixty (60) trading day period shall be extended by the number of trading days during such period and any extension thereof contemplated by this proviso during which such registration statement is not effective or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use) (each, an &#8220; allowable grace period &#8221;). for purposes of determining the length of a grace period above, such grace period shall begin on and include the date the investors receive the notice referred to in clause (i) above and shall end on and include the later of the date the investors receive the notice referred to in clause (ii) above and the date referred to in such notice. the provisions of section 3(g) hereof shall not be applicable during the period of any allowable grace period. upon expiration of each grace period, the company shall again be bound by the first sentence of section 3(f) with respect to the information giving rise thereto unless such material, non-public information is no longer applicable. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 3(r), the company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of common stock to a transferee of an investor in accordance with the terms of the securities agreement in connection with any sale of registrable securities with respect to which such investor has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the particular registration statement to the extent applicable, prior to such investor&#8217;s receipt of the notice of a grace period and for which the investor has not yet settled. &#160; (s) &#160; the company shall take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by each investor of its registrable securities pursuant to each registration statement. &#160; 4.&#160;&#160; obligations of the investors . &#160; (a) &#160; at least five (5) business days prior to the first anticipated filing date of each registration statement, the company shall notify each investor in writing of the information the company requires from each such investor with respect to such registration statement. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to complete the registration pursuant to this agreement with respect to the registrable securities of a particular investor that such investor shall furnish to the company, at least three (3) business days prior to such scheduled filing, such information regarding itself, the registrable securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of the registrable securities held by it, as shall be reasonably required to &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; effect and maintain the effectiveness of the registration of such registrable securities and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the company may reasonably request. &#160; (b) &#160; each investor, by such investor&#8217;s acceptance of the registrable securities, agrees to cooperate with the company as reasonably requested by the company in connection with the preparation and filing of each registration statement hereunder, unless such investor has notified the company in writing of such investor&#8217;s election to exclude all of such investor&#8217;s registrable securities from such registration statement. &#160; (c) &#160; each investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 3(g) or the first sentence of 3(f), such investor will immediately discontinue disposition of registrable securities pursuant to any registration statement(s) covering such registrable securities until such investor&#8217;s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 3(g) or the first sentence of section 3(f) or receipt of notice that no supplement or amendment is required. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 4(c), the company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended shares of common stock to a transferee of an investor in accordance with the terms of the securities agreement in connection with any sale of registrable securities with respect to which such investor has entered into a contract for sale prior to the investor&#8217;s receipt of a notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 3(g) or the first sentence of section 3(f) and for which such investor has not yet settled. &#160; (d) &#160; each investor covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 act as applicable to it in connection with sales of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement. &#160; 5.&#160;&#160; expenses of registration . &#160; all reasonable expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to sections 2 and 3, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees, finra filing fees (if any) and fees and disbursements of counsel for the company shall be paid by the company. the company shall also reimburse buyer for the fees and disbursements of legal counsel in connection with registration, filing or qualification pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of this agreement which amount shall be limited with respect to each registration statement to $10,000. &#160; 6.&#160;&#160; indemnification . &#160; (a) &#160; to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company will, and hereby does, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each investor and each of its directors, officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees, agents, advisors, representatives (and any other persons with a functionally equivalent role of a person holding such titles notwithstanding the lack of such title or any other title) and each person, if any, who controls such investor within the meaning of the 1933 act or the 1934 act and each of the directors, officers, shareholders, &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; members, partners, employees, agents, advisors, representatives (and any other persons with a functionally equivalent role of a person holding such titles notwithstanding the lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons (each, an &#8220; indemnified person &#8221;), against any losses, obligations, claims, damages, liabilities, contingencies, judgments, fines, penalties, charges, costs (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs of defense and investigation), amounts paid in settlement or expenses, joint or several, (collectively, &#8220; claims &#8221;) incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or the sec, whether pending or threatened, whether or not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto (&#8220; indemnified damages &#8221;), to which any of them may become subject insofar as such claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other &#8220;blue sky&#8221; laws of any jurisdiction in which registrable securities are offered (&#8220; blue sky filing &#8221;), or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the sec) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the 1933 act, the 1934 act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being, collectively, &#8220; violations &#8221;). subject to section 6(c), the company shall reimburse the indemnified persons, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this section 6(a): (i) shall not apply to a claim by an indemnified person arising out of or based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by such indemnified person for such indemnified person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto and (ii) shall not be available to a particular investor to the extent such claim is based on a failure of such investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by the company (to the extent applicable), including, without limitation, a corrected prospectus, if such prospectus or corrected prospectus was timely made available by the company pursuant to section 3(d) and then only if, and to the extent that, following the receipt of the corrected prospectus no grounds for such claim would have existed; and (iii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified person and shall survive the transfer of any of the registrable securities by any of the investors pursuant to section 9. &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; (b) &#160; in connection with any registration statement in which an investor is participating, such investor agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in section 6(a), the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the registration statement and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the 1933 act or the 1934 act (each, an &#8220; indemnified party &#8221;), against any claim or indemnified damages to which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or otherwise, insofar as such claim or indemnified damages arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case, to the extent, and only to the extent, that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such investor expressly for use in connection with such registration statement; and, subject to section 6(c) and the below provisos in this section 6(b), such investor will reimburse an indemnified party any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim; provided, however, the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6(b) and the agreement with respect to contribution contained in section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of such investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided further that such investor shall be liable under this section 6(b) for only that amount of a claim or indemnified damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such investor as a result of the applicable sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of any of the registrable securities by any of the investors pursuant to section 9. &#160; (c) &#160; promptly after receipt by an indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) under this section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including, without limitation, any governmental action or proceeding) involving a claim, such indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the indemnified person or the indemnified party (as the case may be); provided, however, an indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the indemnifying party if: (i) the indemnifying party has at that time agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such claim and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) in any such claim; or (iii) the named parties to any such claim (including, without limitation, any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified person or such indemnified party (as the case may be) shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified person or such indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified person or such indemnified party (as the case may be) notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, then the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party, provided further that in the case of clause (iii) above the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one (1) separate legal counsel for such indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be). the indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be) shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be) which relates to such action or claim. the indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be) reasonably apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. no indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent; provided, however, the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be) of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the indemnified party. following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party or indemnified person (as the case may be) with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified person or indemnified party (as the case may be) under this section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially and adversely prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. &#160; (d) &#160; no person involved in the sale of registrable securities who is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to indemnification from any person involved in such sale of registrable securities who is not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation. &#160; (e) &#160; the indemnification required by this section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or indemnified damages are incurred. &#160; (f) &#160; the indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the indemnified party or indemnified person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law. &#160; 7.&#160;&#160; contribution . &#160; to the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however: (i) no contribution shall be made under circumstances &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; where the maker would not have been liable for indemnification under the fault standards set forth in section 6 of this agreement, (ii) no person involved in the sale of registrable securities which person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any person involved in such sale of registrable securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation;

within the meaning of the securities act, and any commission paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the securities act. at the time a particular offering of the shares of common stock is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed, which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of common stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling stockholders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or re-allowed or paid to broker-dealers. &#160; under the securities laws of some states, the shares of common stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. in addition, in some states the shares of common stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; with. &#160; there can be no assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. &#160;
