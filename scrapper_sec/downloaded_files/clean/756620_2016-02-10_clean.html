general market and economic conditions; ongoing evaluation of the issuer&#8217;s business, financial condition, operations, prospects and strategic alternatives; the relative attractiveness of alternative business and investment opportunities; tax considerations; and other factors and future developments. &#160; the reporting persons may also be deemed to be members of a &#8220;group,&#8221; within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the act, which could be considered to be comprised of the reporting persons and the orange entities due to the entry into the sale and purchase agreement by dt holdings, deutsche telekom and the orange entities with the issuer.&#160;&#160;the closing of the sale of the shares of ee in consideration for, inter alia, ordinary shares under the sale and purchase agreement took place on january 29, 2016 pursuant to which the reporting persons acquired the dt shares and the orange entities acquired the orange shares.&#160;&#160;effective january 29, 2016, there ceased to be any contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding between the reporting persons and the orange entities with respect to the acquisition, ownership, holding, voting or disposition of securities of the issuer.&#160;&#160;accordingly, any &#8220;group&#8221; within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the act that may have been formed among the reporting persons and the orange entities has been terminated. &#160; the information set forth in or incorporated by reference in items 3, 5 and 6 of this schedule 13d, including, without limitation, as to the rights and obligations of the reporting persons pursuant to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, the relationship agreement, the contingent purchase agreement and the other matters described therein, is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this item 4. &#160;

or &#160; (b)&#160;&#160; if, in the purchaser&#8217;s reasonable opinion, the action either (i) is likely to have an adverse effect on the future liability to tax of a target company or any other member of the purchaser&#8217;s group which adverse effect is material in the context of the purchaser's group taken as a whole (including for these purposes the target companies) (unless and until the indemnity referred to in paragraph 3.3 (a) above is extended to include and cover fully any such additional future liability to tax) provided that the loss or deferral of any relief (other than a purchaser&#8217;s relief) shall not be deemed to have such an effect or (ii) would be prejudicial to the business of a target company or any other member of the purchaser&#8217;s group where such prejudice is material in the context of the purchaser&#8217;s group taken as a whole (including for these purposes the target companies) (provided that the purchaser shall not be entitled to invoke its right not to take any action requested by the sellers on the basis of (ii) unless it shall first have discussed in good faith its concerns with the sellers and taken any steps reasonably requested by the sellers (acting jointly) to reduce the likelihood of the requested action having such&#160;&#160;prejudicial effect, which may, subject to such steps being reasonable in all the circumstances, include allowing the sellers jointly to pursue a dispute in their own names and/or making it clear publicly that the dispute is being pursued at the request of the sellers); or &#160; &#160; - 105 - &#160; &#160; (c)&#160;&#160; in the case of any action which relates to any actual or proposed tax litigation unless (if reasonably requested by the purchaser) an independent tax adviser, after disclosure of all relevant information and documents to such independent tax adviser and provided that the purchaser&#8217;s reasonable comments are taken into account in any instructions given to such independent tax adviser and that the purchaser has been given the opportunity to attend any consultation (including any consultation that takes place by telephone) with such independent tax adviser, advises that it is reasonable to take the action requested by the sellers (acting jointly). &#160; 3.4 &#160; if the sellers do not jointly request the purchaser to take any appropriate action within twenty (20) business days of notice of the relevant tax demand having been given or deemed to have been given to the sellers pursuant to paragraph 3.1 or other request by the purchaser for direction as to how to conduct the disputed matter in accordance with paragraph 3.2 (or, where the sellers have been notified of a shorter applicable time limit for responding to the relevant tax authority, by two (2) business days prior to the expiry of that time limit), or no action is required to be taken by virtue of any of the provisions of paragraph&#160; 3.3 , the purchaser shall be free to satisfy or settle (or to allow the target company concerned to satisfy or settle) the relevant disputed matter on such terms as it may, acting reasonably, think fit, which shall not include taking any step which they would not have taken in the absence of the provisions of this schedule. &#160; 3.5 &#160; paragraphs 3.3(b) and (c) shall not apply so as to prevent a seller claiming any relief (a corresponding adjustment claim ) to which it may be entitled as a result of any transfer pricing adjustment imposed (or sought to be imposed) by a tax authority on a target company (including under the provisions of section 174 of the taxation (international and other provisions) act 2010 or any competent authority or mutual agreement procedure available under the terms of any applicable double tax treaty) and the action which the sellers may request under paragraph 3.2 may include requesting the purchaser's procuring that the target companies take such action as is reasonably necessary in relation to the corresponding adjustment claim. &#160;
