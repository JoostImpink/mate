(b) indemnification by seller of registrable securities. in ------------------------------------------------------- connection with any registration statement in which a seller of registrable securities is participating, each such seller will furnish to the company in writing such information with respect to such seller as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and agrees to indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, the company, its directors and officers and each person who controls the company (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any untrue statement is contained in information with respect to such seller furnished in writing by such seller expressly for use therein. in no event shall the liability of any seller of registrable securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such seller upon the sale of such seller's registrable securities in connection with any registration statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation. -8- page 48 of 68 pages (c) conduct of indemnification proceedings. any person entitled --------------------------------------- to indemnification hereunder (each, an "indemnified party") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (each, an "indemnifying party") after the receipt by such person of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such person will claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this agreement (but the failure to give such notice will not affect the right to indemnification or contribution hereunder unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure) and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all reasonable fees and expenses (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder). such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). an indemnifying party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding without the indemnified party's prior written consent, unless the terms of such settlement, compromise or consent include an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability or loss arising out of such proceeding.
