continue in or carry on any business which is competitive with the business, including owning or controlling any financial interest in any corporation, partnership, firm or other form of business organization which is so engaged; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the ownership of securities of buyer as herein contemplated or in other corporations which are listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the national over-the-counter market in an amount which shall not exceed 5% of the outstanding shares of any such corporation. buyer confirms and agrees that fiskars, inc., an affiliate of the shareholders, currently designs, manufactures and sells surge protectors and the other products identified in schedule 5.1.(a) and this section 5.1 is not intended in any manner to limit or restrict fiskars, inc. or any other affiliate of the shareholders from conducting any part of that business. the parties agree that the geographic scope of this covenant not to compete shall extend worldwide. the parties agree that buyer may sell, assign or otherwise transfer this covenant not to compete, in whole or in part, to any person, corporation, firm or entity that purchases all or part of the business of the fiskars companies. in the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the provisions of this covenant not to compete are excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope or activity, it is expressly agreed that this covenant not to compete shall be construed so that the remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect, and any such over broad provisions shall be deemed, without further action on the part of any person, to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction. as of the closing, buyer and fiskars will enter into the form of non-compete agreement annexed hereto as schedule 5.1(a)(1) which will be consistent with the foregoing provisions. 5.1.(b) covenant of confidentiality. no shareholder shall at any time subsequent to the closing, except as explicitly requested by buyer, (i) use for any

offer employment to any employee of any of the fiskars companies whose employment is continued by any of the fiskars companies or the buyer after the closing date unless such fiskars company or the buyer first terminates the employment of such employee. 5.1.(d) equitable relief for violations. each shareholder agrees that the provisions and restrictions contained in this section 5.1 are necessary to protect the legitimate continuing interests of buyer and company in acquiring the shares, and that any violation or breach of these provisions will result in irreparable injury to buyer for which a remedy at law would be inadequate and that, in addition to any relief at law which may be available to buyer for such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this agreement, buyer shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief as a court may grant after considering the intent of this section 5.1. 5.2. hart-scott-rodino act filings. to the

closing, shareholders shall cause the fiskars companies to give buyer, its counsel, accountants and other representatives (i) access during normal business hours to all of the properties, books,

("holdings") (fiskars and holdings are collectively referred to herein as "shareholders") agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of deltec power systems, inc. ("company"). this letter agreement may be referred to in other writings as the "amendment agreement." article 9 of the stock purchase agreement provides that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement would take place at the offices of the company at the close of business on january 4, 1996, or at such other time as we would mutually agree. the closing did not occur on january 4, 1996. at buyer's request, we have agreed to extend the time for closing in consideration for amendments to the stock purchase agreement and certain financial concessions as follows: 1. the introductory paragraph of article 9 of the stock purchase agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows: "the closing of this transaction (the "closing") shall take place at the offices of the company, 2727 kurtz street, san diego, california, at the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that buyer closes on and is entitled to funding under its secured term and revolving credit facility with j.p. morgan & co., as agent bank, and its contemplated bond financing, with aggregate net available funds of at least $158,500,000 (collectively, the "anticipated financing") or (ii) march 15, 1996. such date is referred to in this agreement as the "closing date." time is of the essence as to the closing." 2. in the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement does not occur on or before the close of business on march 15, 1996 for any reason whatsoever (other than in the event buyer makes a buyer's tender of closing to shareholders on or before such date, buyer shall have made all payments due under this letter agreement, and the shareholders fail to proceed with closing on or before such date), buyer shall pay to shareholders, as a break-up fee, $5 million, which shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the second business day following such date. in the event payment is not made when due, such amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to five percent (5%) in excess of the prime lending rate announced from time to time by firstar bank milwaukee, n.a. (the "prime rate"), which rate shall change as and when the prime rate changes. such break-up fee shall be paid to shareholders in lieu of any other claims or damages shareholders may have as a result of buyer's failure to close such transactions, provided that if buyer's failure to close did not result from its inability (notwithstanding its good faith and reasonable efforts) to obtain the anticipated financing, the shareholders shall retain their right to bring an action for specific performance to cause buyer to close such transactions. such payment shall be made to the following account: skandinaviska enskilda banken, new york routing number (aba#): 026003036 for further credit to: fiskars oy ab, account #3843 contact: alan palmer (212) 907-4700 3. in consideration of the agreement of the shareholders to postpone closing as provided in section 1 hereof, buyer shall pay the shareholders the following amounts: (a) $1.5 million; and (b) an amount equal to 12% per annum of $75 million ($24,658 per day) from january 19, 1996 until the earliest to occur of the: (i) termination of the stock purchase agreement in accordance with its terms as amended by this amendment ("termination"), (ii) closing or (iii) march 15, 1996; and (c) an amount equal to interest that would accrue at one percent (1%) per annum in excess of the prime rate on $82.5 million from january 19, 1996 until the earliest to occur of: (i) termination, (ii) closing or (iii) march 15, 1996. the sum of the amount described in section 3(a), plus the amounts described in sections 3(b) and 3(c) for the period from january 19 through january 31, 1996, shall be paid by buyer on friday, february 9, 1996. the amounts accruing under sections 3(b) and 3(c) for the period after january 31 and before march 1, 1996 shall be paid on march 1, 1996 and for the period after february 29, 1996 and before closing or march 15, 1996, as the case may be, shall be paid on the closing date or march 15, 1996, as the case may be. all such payments shall be made by a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account described in section 2 above. in the event that buyer obtains bridge financing for the cash portion of the purchase price payable to the shareholders under the stock purchase agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement close on or before february 15, 1996, the buyer may credit against the cash purchase price payable to fiskars at the closing one-half of the amount paid to the shareholders pursuant to section 3.(a) hereof, provided that buyer must obtain the consent of shareholders to any bridge financing that: (i) contains any warrants, options, stock or other equity exercisable or issuable at less than market value when exercised or issued and that dilute (or could dilute) shareholders' interest in buyer to an extent unacceptable to shareholders, or (ii) is not customary bridge financing obtained from recognized financial institutions or investment or merchant bankers. 4. each of the parties to the stock purchase agreement hereby waives each and every one of the conditions precedent to its obligation to proceed with closing, provided that the following conditions precedent shall remain in full force and effect: (i) the condition in sections 6.2 and 7.2 to deliver the closing documents specified in sections 9.1 and 9.2 (with the exception of the compliance certificates described in sections 9.1(b) and 9.2(c)); and (ii) the condition that a party may refuse to close if it has been enjoined from closing by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action not brought by the party asserting the condition precedent. none of such waived conditions shall be asserted by any party as a reason not to close the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. in the event closing occurs, nothing in this amendment agreement shall waive a party's rights to indemnity under article 8 of the stock purchase agreement except to the extent of claims released pursuant to section 1 of the agreement not to sue or interfere of even date herewith among the parties. 5. [intentionally left blank]. 6. buyer shall pay and indemnify and hold the shareholders and the company harmless against all reasonable expenses of the shareholders' accountants, kpmg peat marwick and

agreement have not closed and that all such cooperative efforts should be discontinued until closing, except as provided below. buyer, on the one hand, and shareholder and company, on the other hand, hereby confirm their respective duties to maintain information received from the shareholders and company, on the one hand, and from buyer, on the other hand, confidential pursuant to those certain

respective employees, consultants and agents or will be disclosed to them as part of due diligence or otherwise as part of these transactions. notwithstanding the foregoing, buyer and deltec shall continue to pursue two pending business transactions that involve (i) deltec manufacturing and selling certain products to buyer on a private label basis and (ii) a joint technical project related to combining deltec software and buyer's hardware for the purpose of designing a product to satisfy a supply contract with 3com, provided that any disclosure by deltec to buyer of any source code relating to deltec's software shall be subject to a special confidentiality agreement related to such software on terms mutually acceptable to deltec and buyer. the shareholders shall cause deltec: (i) to maintain any proprietary information received from buyer related to such development project confidential, (ii) not to use such information without the written consent of buyer in the event the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement do not close, and (iii) not to pursue (either singly or with others) a supply contract with 3com competitive with buyer for the product(s) that is the subject of the joint technical project described above. each of deltec and buyer may decide, in its absolute discretion, to enter into a joint supply arrangement with the other party for the 3com product, which supply arrangement will be on reasonable and customary terms and conditions. in addition, shareholders and company acknowledge and consent that buyer may continue to discuss the terms and conditions of post-closing employment arrangements with the senior management of the company. 8. section 2.1 of the stock purchase agreement is hereby amended as follows: (a) section

of directors (the "board") of exide electronics group, inc., a delaware corporation (the "corporation"), acting pursuant to the authority granted to the board in accordance with provisions of section 151(g) of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, at a duly convened meeting of the board at which a quorum was present and acted throughout. resolved, that pursuant to the authority expressly granted to the board by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation (the "certificate of incorporation"), there is hereby created a series g convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, which shall consist of 1,000,000 shares of serial preferred stock (hereinafter called the "series g preferred stock"). the series g preferred stock shall have the following powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions (in addition to the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, set forth in the certificate of incorporation, which may be applicable to the serial preferred stock) as follows: a. dividends 1. cumulative. the holders of shares of series g preferred stock (hereinafter called the "holders") shall be entitled to receive, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, cash dividends at the rate of: (i) eighty cents ($0.80) per share per annum, and no more, through march 31, 2001, and (ii) thereafter at a rate of one dollar twenty cents ($1.20) per share, and no more. dividends shall be payable in cash quarterly, in arrears, commencing on june 30, 1996, and thereafter on the last business day of march, june, september and december of each year that any series g preferred stock shall be outstanding. such dividends are prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any distribution (as defined below) on the common stock of the corporation (the "common stock"), and shall be prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any distribution on any other preferred stock of the corporation unless such stock is expressly senior to the series g preferred stock after written consent of holders, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. such dividends shall accrue on each share of series g preferred stock from day to day from the date of initial issuance thereof whether or not earned, declared, or paid, and whether or not funds are legally available therefor, so that if such dividends with respect to any previous dividend period at the rate provided for herein have not been paid on, or declared and set apart for, all shares of series g preferred stock at the time outstanding, the deficiency shall be fully paid on, or declared and set apart for, such shares before any distribution shall be paid on, or declared and set apart for common stock or any other series of preferred stock except as aforesaid. 2. all cash dividends shall be paid by the corporation to the holders except to the extent (but only to the extent) a payment would cause the corporation to violate any covenant or condition under any of its credit or debt financing agreements. in the event any part or all of a dividend payment will cause such violation, the corporation will use reasonable and good faith efforts to obtain waivers of compliance with its debt covenants for the purpose of such dividend and will so notify the holders; provided, that such efforts shall not require the corporation to incur additional expenses, except for reasonable legal expenses related to preparing such waivers. 3. the corporation shall pay all cash dividends by certified bank check or wire transfer. 4. for purposes of this section (a), unless the context otherwise requires, "distribution" shall mean the transfer of cash or property without consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise, or the purchase or redemption of shares of the corporation (other than repurchases of common stock held by directors, employees or consultants of the corporation upon termination of their directorship, employment or services pursuant to agreements providing for such repurchase, which agreements were either in effect prior to the closing date or in forms which are customary and reasonable based on similar industry or corporation standards) for cash or property, including any such transfer, purchase or redemption by a subsidiary of the corporation. b. preference on liquidation 1. in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of shares of series g preferred stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment shall be made in respect of the common stock (and before payment with respect to any other series of preferred stock then in existence and outstanding which is not expressly senior to the series g preferred stock as permitted by section (a)), if any, an amount equal to twenty dollars ($20) per share of series g preferred stock, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for distribution. after setting apart or paying in full the preferential amounts due to the holders, the remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to stockholders, if any, shall be distributed exclusively to the holders of common stock, each such issued and outstanding share of common stock entitling the holder thereof to receive an equal proportion of said remaining assets, unless the rights, preferences or privileges of another series of preferred stock then in existence and outstanding has priority over the common stock, in which case the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to receive assets prior to the receipt by holders of the common stock as mandated by the terms of such preferred stock issue. if upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders the full amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders shall share ratably in any distribution of assets according to the respective amounts which would be payable in respect of the shares of series g preferred stock held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to said shares were paid in full. 2. in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the corporation shall, within ten (10) days after the date the board of directors approves such action, or twenty (20) days prior to any stockholders' meeting called to approve such action, or twenty (20) days after the commencement of any involuntary proceeding, whichever is earlier, give each holder initial written notice of the proposed action by airmail or other express delivery service. such initial written notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of such proposed action, including a description of the stock, cash and property to be received by the holders upon consummation of the proposed action and the date of delivery thereof. if any material change in the facts set forth in the initial notice shall occur, the corporation shall promptly give written notice by airmail or other express delivery service to each holder of such material change. 3. the corporation shall not consummate any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation before the expiration of thirty (30) days after the mailing by airmail or other express delivery service of the initial notice or ten (10) days after the mailing by airmail or other express delivery service of any subsequent written notice, whichever is later; provided that any such 30- day or 10-day period may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of all of the outstanding shares of series g preferred stock. 4. in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation which will involve the distribution of assets other than cash, the corporation shall promptly engage competent independent appraisers to determine the value of the assets to be distributed to the holders, the holders of shares of other series of preferred stock then in existence and outstanding, if any, and the holders of shares of common stock (it being understood that with respect to the valuation of securities, the corporation shall engage such appraiser as shall be approved by the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of series g preferred stock, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). the corporation shall, upon receipt of such appraiser's valuation, give prompt written notice to each holder of the appraiser's valuation. c. voting except as otherwise required by law or as set forth herein, the shares of series g preferred stock shall be voted in accordance with any stockholder agreement then in effect between the corporation and the holder, and if no stockholder agreement is then in effect, such shares shall be voted in the manner the holders deem appropriate; in each case as if it were common stock. subject to the terms of any stockholders agreement in effect, each holder shall be entitled to such number of votes for the series g preferred stock held by the holder on the record date fixed for such meeting, or on the effective date of such written consent, as shall be equal to the largest number of whole shares of the corporation's common stock into which all of the holder's shares of series g preferred stock are convertible immediately after the close of business on the record date fixed for such meeting or the effective date of such written consent. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the holders shall be entitled to vote as a separate class for any changes in the rights and privileges of the series g preferred stock. d. conversion rights each share of series g preferred stock shall be convertible at any time into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the corporation at the option of the holder. the number of shares of common stock into which each share of the series g preferred stock may be converted shall be determined by dividing the original purchase price by the series g conversion price (determined as hereinafter provided) in effect at the time of the conversion. the original purchase price of the series g preferred stock is $20 per share. subject to adjustment of the series g conversion price pursuant to section (e), the series g preferred stock shall be convertible on a share-for-share basis into the corporation's common stock. 1. the series g conversion price per share at which shares of common stock shall be initially issuable upon conversion of any shares of series g preferred stock shall be twenty dollars ($20). 2. the holder may exercise the conversion rights as to all shares of series g preferred stock owned by the holder or any part thereof by delivering to the corporation during regular business hours, at the office of any transfer agent of the corporation for the series g preferred stock, or at the principal office of the corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer to the corporation (if required by it), accompanied by written notice stating that the holder elects to convert such shares. 3. conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when such delivery is made or to be made, and such date is referred to herein as the "conversion date". as promptly as practicable after delivery of the certificates representing series g preferred stock to be converted the corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of such holder, at such office or other place designated by the holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock to which such holder is entitled and a check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of common stock as provided in subparagraph (4) of this section (d). the holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the common stock on the applicable conversion date unless the transfer books of the corporation are closed on the date, in which event it shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the common stock on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open, but the series g conversion price shall be that in effect on the conversion date. upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares of series g preferred stock represented by a certificate surrendered for conversion, the corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder, at the expense of the corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of series g preferred stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered. 4. no fractional shares of common stock or script shall be issued upon conversion of shares of series g preferred stock. if more than one share of series g preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of series g preferred stock so surrendered. instead of any fractional shares of common stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of series g preferred stock, the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair market value of such fractional interest as determined by the corporation's board of directors. 5. at the time the corporation delivers shares of common stock to the holder, the corporation shall pay to the holder the unpaid dividends on the converted series g preferred stock accrued through the conversion date to the extent otherwise permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, including without limitation, section a.2 hereof. in the event the payment of such unpaid dividends is not permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, the holder may elect, at the holder's option, to purchase additional shares of the corporation's common stock with such unpaid dividends at the series g conversion price at which the holder is converting series g preferred stock into the corporation's common stock. such election shall be made by the holder sending a written notice to the corporation within ten (10) days following the corporation's failure to pay such dividends. the corporation shall deliver certificates for shares of the corporation's common stock so purchased as promptly as practicable after receipt of the holder's notice. unpaid dividends that are not used by the holder to purchase the corporation's common stock shall remain accrued and outstanding and shall be paid at such time as the restrictions against payment of such dividends no longer apply. 6. the corporation shall pay any and all united states issue and other taxes (other than taxes with respect to income, gain or receipts) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of series g preferred stock pursuant thereto. the corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of common stock in a name other than that in which the series g preferred stock so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. 7. the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued common stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of series g preferred stock, the full number of shares of common stock deliverable upon the conversion of all series g preferred stock from time to time outstanding. the corporation shall from time to time (subject to obtaining necessary director and stockholder action), in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware, increase the authorized amount of its common stock remaining unissued to an amount that is sufficient to permit the conversion of all of the shares of series g preferred stock at the time outstanding. 8. all shares of common stock which may be issued upon conversion of the shares of series g preferred stock will upon issuance by the corporation be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof. e. adjustment of series g conversion price the series g conversion price from time to time in effect shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 1. stock splits, dividends and combinations. in case the corporation shall at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock, or shall issue a stock dividend on its outstanding common stock, the series g conversion price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the corporation shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of common stock, the series g conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased, effective at the close of business on the date of such subdivision, dividend or combination, as the case may be. 2. non-cash dividends, stock purchase rights, capital reorganizations and dissolutions. in case: a. the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend, or any other distribution, payable otherwise than in cash; or b. the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or to receive any other rights; or c. of any capital reorganization of the corporation, reclassification of the capital stock of the corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of common stock), consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into another corporation or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to another corporation; or d. of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation; then, and in any such case, the corporation shall cause to be mailed to the transfer agent for the series g preferred stock and to the holders of record, at least ten (10) days prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on which (x) a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, or (y) such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 3. in the event the corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons or evidences of indebtedness issued by other persons, then, in each such case, the holders shall be entitled to the distributions at the rate provided for in section (a) above before any distribution shall be made to the holders of common stock, and no adjustment to the series g conversion price provided for in this section (e) shall be applicable. 4. the corporation will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all of the provisions of this section (e) and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders. in any such event, the series g conversion price shall be equitably adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the effect on the series g preferred stock and the corporation's common stock from any such events. 5. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the series g conversion price pursuant to this section (e), the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof, and prepare and furnish to each holder affected thereby a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (a) such adjustment or readjustment, (b) the series g conversion price at the time in effect, and (c) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of its shares. 6. any shares of series g preferred stock that are converted shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of series g preferred stock. 7. so long as any shares of series g preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not, without first obtaining the approval by vote or written consent, in the manner provided by law, of the holders of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the total number of shares of series g preferred stock outstanding, voting separately as a class, (a) reduce or eliminate any or all of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the series g preferred stock or increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of series g preferred stock; or (b) amend the provisions of this paragraph (7); provided, however, that the corporation may, with the holders' written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, create new class or series of shares of preferred stock senior to or on a parity with the series g preferred stock as to voting rights, dividends or a distribution of assets of the corporation in liquidation. f. redemption 1. optional redemption: corporation. at any time after march 31, 1996, if the market price, as defined below, of the corporation's common stock has

(c) in the event (i) stockholder is prohibited by section 3.4(a) hereof from tendering or exchanging any company securities into a tender or exchange offer which results in a consummated offer and, as a result of the consummated offer, the bidder beneficially owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of the company and (ii) the stockholder has not sold all of its company securities within ninety (90) days following the consummation of the consummated offer, then within one hundred twenty (120) days following the consummation of the consummated offer, company shall pay to stockholder in cash an amount equal to (i) the sum of the highest per share or other per unit price paid by the bidder in the consummated offer, less the average of the last reported sales price per share of common stock and/or other company security if listed on the nasdaq stock market or the average closing price per share of common stock and/or other company security if listed on a national securities exchange for the thirty (30) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the fifth business day prior to the commencement of the tender or exchange offer (or if such shares or other company securities subject to the tender or exchange offer are not listed on the nasdaq stock market or on a national securities exchange, the fair market value of a share of common stock and/or unit of other company security subject to the tender or exchange offer, calculated as of the fifth business day immediately prior to the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, as determined by an independent appraiser with an established national reputation for appraising businesses selected by mutual agreement of company and stockholder, or in the absence of such mutual agreement, selected by price waterhouse llp), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares and/or other company securities subject to the tender or exchange offer held by stockholder on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following consummation of the consummated offer. (d) in the event of an exchange offer or a tender offer other than an all cash tender offer, the "highest per share or other per unit price paid by the bidder" as such phrase applies to non-cash consideration paid by the bidder, shall mean the fair market value of such non-cash consideration calculated on a per share or per unit basis, as the case may be, as of the time of the applicable payment, as determined by an independent appraiser with an established national reputation for appraising businesses selected by mutual agreement of the company and stockholder, or in the absence of such mutual agreement, selected by price waterhouse llp. 3.5. restrictions following offerings for so long as the stockholder shall own or hold any of the shares, the stockholder will agree to reasonable and customary "lock-up" restrictions on the resale of company securities during or following a registered public offering of any securities of the company, provided that such restrictions do not apply for more than one hundred fifty (150) days following the completion of such registered public offering and that such restrictions are also agreed to by the company and all of its affiliates, directors and executive officers whose agreement is deemed necessary by the underwriters of such offering. 3.6. registration rights (a) piggyback registration. if at any time that the stockholder owns or holds shares, the company proposes to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to an offering of common stock solely for cash (other than a registration statement (i) on form s-8 or any successor form to such form or in connection with any employee or director welfare, benefit or compensation plan; (ii) on form s-4 or any successor form to such form or in connection with an exchange offer; (iii) in connection with a rights offering exclusively to existing holders of common stock; (iv) in connection with an offering solely to employees of the company or its subsidiaries; or (v) relating to a transaction pursuant to rule 145 under the securities act), whether or not for its own account, the company shall give prompt written notice of such proposed filing to the stockholder. the notice referred to in the preceding sentence shall constitute an offer by company to the stockholder of the opportunity to register such number of shares as the stockholder may request (a "piggyback registration"). the company shall include in the piggyback registration and in any underwriting in connection therewith all shares for which the request is received by the company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the notice referred to above has been given by the company. the stockholder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of the shares from a piggyback registration at any time prior to the effective date of such piggyback registration or, if the piggyback registration is for an underwritten offering prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement by stockholder and company. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the company and the managing underwriter advises the company that the total number of shares requested to be included in such registration, when combined with the shares of common stock that the company otherwise proposes to register, would create a substantial risk of materially reducing the proceeds of the offering or price per share of the common stock to be offered, the number of shares requested to be included by stockholder in any such piggyback registration shall be reduced on a pro rata basis among stockholder and any other stockholder also requesting participation in such piggyback registration. (b) demand registration. upon a written request of the stockholder, the company shall file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written request for registration under the securities act of all or part of its shares; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to file a registration statement hereunder until october __, 1996. any such request by the stockholder shall specify the aggregate number of shares proposed to be sold and shall also specify the intended method of disposition thereof; provided, however, that the stockholder's demand shall be for registration of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares owned by stockholder as of the date hereof or three percent (3%) of the company's then outstanding shares of common stock, whichever is less. the company shall use its best efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earlier of six (6) months after the date of effectiveness of the registration statement or until the stockholder has sold the number of shares for which it requested registration. the stockholder shall not be entitled to make a demand pursuant to this section 3.6 more than two (2) times; provided, however, that if no registration statement is declared effective with respect to a demand which the stockholder has made (other than because the stockholder has requested that the registration statement not be declared effective) that demand shall not be counted for purposes of this limit. the company may defer filing a registration statement pursuant to this section 3.6 for up to ninety (90) days if in the good faith reasonable judgment of the board the filing of such registration statement would create a material adverse effect on any material company financing planned or contemplated or, pursuant to a written opinion of company's legal counsel, require the company to disclose non-public information, the disclosure of which would, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the board, have a material adverse effect on the company. (c) registration procedures. (i) the company shall have no obligation to include shares in a registration statement pursuant to this section 3.6 unless and until the stockholder has furnished the company with all information and statements about or pertaining to the stockholder in such reasonable detail and on such timely basis as is reasonably deemed by the company to be necessary or appropriate for the preparation of the registration statement. (ii) the company shall take such action to list the shares to be registered hereunder on any securities exchange on which the common stock is registered. (iii) in connection with any registration hereunder, company shall use its best efforts to register and qualify the shares to be registered under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as stockholder shall request, provided, however, that the company will not be required to do any of the following: (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not be required but for this section 3.6(c); (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction; or (iii) file any general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. (iv) company shall immediately notify stockholder of the happening of any event of which it has knowledge as a result of which the prospectus included in a registration statement filed pursuant to a demand registration or piggyback registration, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. (v) company shall take such other actions required to register the shares hereunder as stockholder may reasonably request. (d) registration expenses. if shares are included in a registration statement filed by the company, the stockholder shall pay all transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale of the shares, the fees and expenses of its own counsel, and its pro-rata share of any underwriting discounts or commissions or the equivalent thereof. company shall pay all other costs and expenses associated with any demand registration or piggyback registration, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with blue sky laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, and fees and expenses of counsel for the company and all independent certified public accountants and other persons retained by the company. 3.7. indemnification in connection with registration statements (a) in connection with any demand registration or any piggyback registration pursuant to this agreement, stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless company and any underwriters (as defined in the securities act) of such offering and their respective officers, directors and controlling persons (within the meaning of either the securities act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) from any and all loss, liability, claims, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by them insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement or prospectus covering the shares to be sold or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that stockholder shall only be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such stockholder as furnished in writing to company or any underwriter by or on behalf of stockholder expressly for use in the registration statement or prospectus covering the shares to be sold. except to the extent set forth in the foregoing sentence, company shall indemnify and hold harmless stockholder, its respective officers, directors, partners and controlling persons (within the meaning of either the securities act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) participating in the demand registration or any piggyback registration from any and all loss, liability, claims, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by them insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact furnished by company for use in such registration statement or prospectus related thereto or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact pertaining to company and required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. the indemnification provided by this section 3.7 shall be a continuing right to indemnification and shall survive the registration and sale of any securities by stockholder or any other person entitled to indemnification hereunder. (b) if the indemnification provided for in section 3.7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, liability, claims, damage or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relevant fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount stockholder shall be obligated to contribute pursuant to this section 3.7 shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such stockholder from the sale of shares sold pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute (less the aggregate amount of any damages which stockholder has otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of such shares). 3.8. filings with the securities and exchange commission with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that may permit the sale of the shares to the public without registration, the company agrees to use its best efforts to: (a) remain subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and file with the securities and exchange commission in a timely manner all reports required of the company thereunder; and (b) furnish to the stockholder upon written request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of section 13 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. 4. representations, warranties and indemnities 4.1. representations and warranties (a) as a material inducement to the company to enter in the purchase agreement and sell the shares to the stockholder, the stockholder hereby represents and warrants to company and agrees that neither stockholder nor any of its affiliates (i) intends to, directly or indirectly, manage or control the affairs of or acquire a controlling interest in the company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (whether through acquisition of stock, assets or otherwise) at this time or in the future; (ii) will in the future seek to directly or indirectly, manage or control the affairs of, or acquire a controlling interest in, the company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (whether through acquisition of stock, assets or otherwise), except as expressly provided for in this agreement; and (iii) will, directly or indirectly, attempt to influence or encourage any other person, company, other entity or group to seek to manage or control the affairs of, or acquire a controlling interest in, the company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (whether through acquisition of stock, assets or otherwise), except as expressly provided for in this agreement. the stockholder hereby expressly acknowledges its understanding that the company would not have entered in the purchase agreement or consummated the transactions contemplated thereby without stockholder's assurances and agreements set forth in this article 4 relating to its present and future role in the company's affairs.
