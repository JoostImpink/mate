(iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement for sale under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the holders of the securities covered thereby (hereinafter in this section referred to as "such holders") participating in such registration may reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable such holders to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities covered thereby owned by such holders. (v) furnish to such holders participating in such registration and to the underwriters of the securities being registered a reasonable number of copies of the registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, and such other documents as such holders or underwriters may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public offering of such securities.

(ix) prepare and promptly file with the securities and exchange commission and promptly notify such holders of the filing of such amendment or supplement to such registration 12 11 statement or prospectus as may be necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when a prospectus relating to such securities is required to be delivered under the securities act, any event shall have occurred as the result of which any such prospectus or any other prospectus as then in effect would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statement therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. (x) advise such holders, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the securities and exchange commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for the purpose and promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued. (xi) as soon as practicable and in no event less than one day prior to the filing of any amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus, furnish copies thereof to such holders and refrain from filing any such amendment or supplement to which a majority in interest of such holders shall have reasonably objected on the grounds that such amendment or supplement does not comply in all material respects with the requirements of the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder, unless in the opinion of counsel for the company the filing of such amendment or supplement is reasonably necessary to protect the company from any liabilities under any applicable federal or state law and such filing will not violate applicable law. (xii) allow the managing underwriter (and its counsel) to conduct "due diligence" investigations of the company and participate in the preparation of the registration statement, and at the request of any such holder, enter into an underwriting agreement containing customary terms, conditions and furnish on the date or dates provided for in the underwriting agreement: (i) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to such holder, addressed to the underwriters and to such holder or holders making such request, opining as to such matters as such underwriters and holder or holders may reasonably request; and (ii) a letter or letters from the independent certified public accountants of the company, addressed to the underwriter and to such holder or holders making such request, covering such matters as such underwriters and holder or holders may reasonably request, in which letters such accountants shall state (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) that they are independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the securities act and that in the opinion of such 13 12 accountants the financial statements and other financial data of the company included in the registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the securities act. (d) the obligations of the company under section 7(b) to comply with requests for demand registrations are subject to the following limitations: (i) the company shall be entitled to postpone up to 60 days in any twelve month period the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to section 7(b) if, at the time it receives a demand notice, the company determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that such registration and sale would materially interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries and promptly gives brea written notice of such determination. if the company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, the demand notice received by the company shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of demand registrations to which brea is entitled pursuant to this section 7. (ii) any demand notice shall be for the registration of shares of common stock representing at least 25% of the total number of shares of common stock issued to the blackstone entities on the date of this agreement or, if less, all shares of common stock owned by the blackstone entities and their permitted transferees. (iii) in the event of a demand registration, sales shall be made through a managing underwriter or underwriters mutually selected by brea and the company. (e) notwithstanding the provisions of section 7(a) and 7(b): (i) in the event of any company registration in which the managing underwriter(s) notify the company that the aggregate amount of securities of the company proposed to be offered by the company, the blackstone entities and other holders would adversely affect the ability to effect such offering, then the number of shares of common stock proposed to be offered by the blackstone entities and any other holders shall be reduced (if need be to zero) to the aggregate amount determined by the managing-underwriter(s) that can be offered without adversely affecting the ability to effect such offering, such reductions to be made pro rata among brea and such other holders in accordance with the number of shares of common stock proposed to be offered by each such offeror; and (ii) in the event of any demand registration in which the managing underwriter(s) notify the company that the aggregate amount of securities of the company proposed to be offered by the company, the blackstone entities 14 13 and any other holders would adversely affect the ability to effect such offering, then the number of shares of common stock proposed to be offered by the blackstone entities shall first be included in such registration; then the shares of common stock, if any, proposed to be included in such registration by the company and any other holders shall be reduced (if need be to zero) to the aggregate amount determined by the managing-underwriter(s) that can be offered without adversely affecting the ability to effect such offering, such reductions to be made pro rata in accordance with the number of shares of common stock proposed to be offered by each such offeror. 8. registration expenses. to the extent permitted by applicable law, the company shall pay all expenses in connection with any company registration or demand registration, including, without limitation, (a) all expenses incident to filing with the nasd, (b) registration fees, (c) printing expenses, (d) accounting and legal fees and expenses of one accounting firm and one law firm to represent all selling stockholders (selected by brea, in the case of any demand registration, and reasonably acceptable to brea, in the case of any company registration), (e) expenses of any special audits incident to or required by any such registration or qualification, (f) premiums for insurance in such amount, if any, deemed appropriate by the managing underwriter, and (g) expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions in connection with such registration or qualification; provided, however, the company shall not be liable for (1) any discounts or commissions to any underwriter attributable to shares of common stock being sold by any selling stockholder, (2) any stock transfer taxes incurred in respect of the shares of common stock being sold by any selling stockholder, or (3) the legal fees of any selling stockholder (other than as set forth in clause 8(d) above). 9. blue sky laws. in any registration under sections 7(a) and 7(b), the company shall use its best efforts to register, qualify, or effect an exemption with respect to the shares of common stock of the blackstone entities under the "blue sky" laws of such states as may be reasonably requested by brea or the managing underwriter(s); provided, however, that the company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdictions. 10. indemnification. in connection with any registration pursuant to section 7: (a) the company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, brea, and each of its partners, officers, employees and agents, and any affiliates (as defined in the securities act) of brea and each person who controls brea (within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act), against any losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages, liabilities, actions or 15 14 judgments, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively, "damages"), joint or several, to which any of them may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such damages arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission by the company, or preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading; and will reimburse brea, and its respective partners, officers, employees and agents, and any affiliates or control persons, for any legal or other expenses incurred by it or any of them in connection with investigating or defending against any such damages; except that the company will not be liable in any such case to brea or any other person or entity to the extent that any damages arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a registration statement, or preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of brea specifically for use therein. (b) brea agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the company, each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, and any affiliates (as defined in the securities act) of the company and each person who controls the company (within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act), against any damages, joint or several, to which any of them may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such damages arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission by the company, or preliminary or final prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by or on behalf of brea, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse the company, its directors, officers, agents, and affiliates or control persons, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such damages. 16 15 (c) any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt notice to the indemnifying person of any claim with respect to which it shall seek indemnification and shall permit such indemnifying person to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person; provided, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (i) the indemnifying person shall have agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (ii) the indemnifying person shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person, or (iii) in the opinion of outside counsel to such person there may be one or more legal defenses available to such person which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying person with respect to such claims (in which case, if the person notifies the indemnifying person in writing that such person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying person, the indemnifying person shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such person). if such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying person, the indemnifying person shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnified person shall be required to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified person of a written release in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. an indemnifying person who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel (and, if necessary, local counsel) for all persons indemnified by such indemnifying person with respect to such claim, unless in the written opinion of outside counsel to an indemnified person a conflict of interest as to the subject matter exists between such indemnified person and another indemnified person with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying person shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of additional counsel for such indemnified person. (d) if for any reason the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable to an indemnified person or is insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated hereby, then the indemnifying person shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified person as a result of such loss, cost, expense, claim damage, liability, action or judgment in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the indemnified 17 16 person and the indemnifying person, but also the relative fault of the indemnified person and the indemnifying person, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 11. lock-up provision. each blackstone entity agrees in connection with any public offering of the company's securities following the date hereof that, upon the request of the managing underwriter(s) in the case of any underwritten public offering, or the company in the case of a non-underwritten public offering, it shall not sell or offer to sell any shares of common stock or any other securities of the company, other than shares of common stock included in the public offering, during the period commencing on the distribution of a "red herring" prospectus for such offering and ending 90 days following the date of the final prospectus used in such offering, provided that all fine family stockholders and all officers and managers of the company have agreed to the same lockup terms. 12. participation in registrations. each blackstone entity may not participate in any registration of securities of the company unless such blackstone entity. (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the company and reasonably acceptable to brea (in the case of any demand registration) which are customary and which are not in direct contradiction of any rights granted to brea or the blackstone entities under this agreement; and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custodial agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements which are customary and which are not in direct contradiction of any rights granted to brea or the blackstone entities under this agreement. 13. request to deregister. the company will promptly deregister any of the shares of the blackstone entities initially included in a registration statement pursuant to section 7 if brea should thereafter desire to withdraw such shares from the proposed offering, provided that (a) the registration statement has not been declared effective, or (b) if the registration statement has been declared effective, it is not current under the requirement of the securities act due to the lapse of time or material changes in the affairs of the company. such deregistration by the company shall in no way indicate that the company or its counsel deem that any such shares meet the requirements for sale under such rule. 14. legend on stock certificates. each certificate evidencing shares of common stock will be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: 18 17 the securities represented by this certificate are subject to the stockholders agreement, dated as of june 25, 1996, among interstate hotels company (the "company") and certain stockholders of the company. a copy of such agreement will be furnished without charge by the company to the holder hereof upon written request. the company will imprint such legends on certificates evidencing shares of common stock outstanding prior to the date hereof. the legend set forth in the paragraph above shall be removed at such time as brea and its permitted transferees no longer own any common stock. 15. brea as representative. for the sake of convenience, notices and other communications required hereunder to be made to the blackstone entities and their permitted transferees, and all notices and other communications required hereunder to be made by the blackstone entities and their permitted transferees to the company and the fine family stockholders, shall be made through brea or such other blackstone affiliate as may be designated by brea. 16. successors and assigns; no third-party beneficiaries. the stipulations, terms, covenants and agreements contained in this agreement shall inure

any person or entity, other than the parties hereto and such successors and permitted transferees, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. 17. assignment. this agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto (other than to permitted transferees of such party) without the consent of the other party hereto. notwithstanding any such assignment, the assigning party will continue to remain primarily liable under this agreement. 18. notices. all notices, demands or requests made pursuant to, under or by virtue of this agreement must be in writing and shall be (i) personally delivered,
