liabilities of the loan parties accrued hereunder and under any other loan document, shall become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all

as if such person was not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any of the loan parties for services in connection with this agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the lenders. neither agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the loan documents. without limiting the generality of the

successor. if no successor shall have been so appointed by the required lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring agent gives notice of its resignation, then

(i) goamerica, inc., a delaware corporation (together with its successors and permitted assigns, the &#147;company&#148;); (ii) each of the shareholders of the company listed on schedule a to this agreement (each a &#147;sponsor&#148; and, collectively the &#147;sponsors&#148;); and (iii) such other persons, if any, that from time to time become parties hereto pursuant to section 8.4 hereof (collectively, together with the sponsors, the &#147;shareholders&#148;). recitals whereas, the company and the sponsors are parties to the stock purchase agreement of even date herewith (the &#147;initial stock purchase agreement&#148;) in which the company has agreed to sell to the sponsors 290,135 shares of series a preferred stock of the company, par value $.01 per share. whereas, the company and the sponsors are parties to the stock purchase agreement of even date herewith (the &#147;acquisition stock purchase agreement&#148; and, collectively with the initial stock purchase agreement, the &#147;clearlake stock purchase agreements&#148;) in which the company has agreed to sell to the sponsors, subject to the happening of the conditions specified therein, up to 6,479,691 additional shares of series a preferred stock of the company. whereas, the parties hereto desire for the company to provide the registration rights set out in this agreement. unless otherwise noted in this agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in section 7. agreement now, therefore, the parties to this agreement hereby agree as follows: 1. demand registrations. 1.1. requests for registration. at any time a sponsor may initiate the registration of common stock to be sold in a public offering (a &#147;demand registration&#148;). subject to the other provisions of this section 1, a sponsor may initiate (on behalf of itself and any of its affiliate) three (3) registrations of all or part of their registrable securities on form s-1 or any similar or successor long-form registration (&#147;long-form registrations&#148;), and, if the company is eligible to utilize a registration statement on form s-3 for resales by selling stockholders, an unlimited (but no more than two such registrations in any twelve month period) number of registrations of all or part of their registrable securities on form s-3 or any similar or successor short-form registration (&#147;short-form registrations&#148;); provided in each case that the aggregate gross offering price of the registrable securities requested to be registered in any long form registration 1 pursuant to this section must equal the greater of (a) $5,000,000 or (b) all of the common stock and conversion shares then held by such sponsor and its affiliates); and provided, further, that the company shall have no liability to any shareholder with respect to any conditions that the securities and exchange commission may impose with respect to any such registration, including any conditions that the securities and exchange commission may impose upon the utilization of rule 415 in connection with any such registration. 1.2. demand notice. all requests for demand registrations shall be made by giving written notice to the company (a &#147;demand notice&#148;). each demand notice shall specify the approximate number of registrable securities requested to be registered. within ten (10) days after receipt of any such demand notice, the company will give written notice of such requested registration to all other holders of registrable securities and, subject to section 1.5, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to include in such registration (and in all related registrations and qualifications under blue sky laws or in compliance with other registration requirements and in any related underwriting) all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 15 days after the delivery of the company&#146;s notice. 1.3. demand registration expenses. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with any registration initiated as a demand registration, whether or not it has become effective. 1.4. short-form registrations. subject to the qualifications set forth herein and subject to any limitations that the securities and exchange commission may impose, (i) demand registrations will be short-form registrations whenever the company is permitted to use any applicable short-form (unless the managing underwriter(s) of such offering requests the company to use a long-form registration in order to sell all of the registrable securities requested to be sold) and (ii) the sponsors may, in connection with any demand registration requested by such holders that is a short-form registration, require the company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file such short-form registration with the securities and exchange commission in accordance with and pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act (or any successor rule then in effect) including, if the company is then eligible, as an automatic shelf registration statement (any such short-form registration, a &#147;shelf registration&#148;). notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, if the securities and exchange commission refuses to declare a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement effective as a valid secondary offering under rule 415 due to the number of registrable securities included in such registration statement relative to the number of shares of common stock outstanding or the number of outstanding shares of common stock held by non-affiliates or for any other reason, then, without any liability under this agreement or any further obligation to register such excess registrable securities, the company shall be permitted to reduce the number of registrable securities included in such registration statement to an amount that does not exceed an amount that the securities and exchange commission allows for the offering thereunder to qualify as a valid secondary offering under rule 415. the company shall not be liable for damages under this agreement as to any registrable securities which are not permitted by the securities and exchange commission to be included in a registration statement due to securities and exchange commission guidance relating to rule 415. 2 1.5. priority on demand registrations. the company shall not include in any demand registration any securities which are not registrable securities without the prior receipt of majority sponsor approval. if a demand registration is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter(s) advises the company that in its opinion the number of registrable securities and, if permitted hereunder, other securities, requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number of registrable securities and other securities, if any, which can be sold therein without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, then the company shall include in such registration, (a) prior to the inclusion of any securities that are not registrable securities, the number of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, pro rata (based on the number of shares requested to be registered) among the respective holders thereof, provided that if the number of securities that are registrable securities that are included in such offering are less than 75% of the number of securities that are registrable securities requested to be included in such offering, such offering shall not count for purposes of calculating the number of long-form registrations initiated by a majority sponsor, and (b) only then securities that are not registrable securities, if the managing underwriter(s) has advised that such securities may be included. 1.6. restrictions on demand registrations. the company will not be obligated to effect any demand registration within 90 days after the closing of a public offering (other than on form s-4 or form s-8 or any successor or similar form, but including the closing of an underwritten distribution pursuant to a shelf registration), except that if such public offering is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter of such public offering determines that a longer period, not to exceed 180 days, is reasonably necessary in its opinion, then such restricted period shall continue for the period designated by the managing underwriter, provided that such period shall not extend beyond 180 days after the closing of such public offering. the company may postpone for up to 45 days (from the date of the request) the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration if and so long as the company determines that such demand registration would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any proposal or plan by the company or any of the subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition or disposition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, registration or issuance of securities, financing or other material transaction. the company may not postpone a demand registration more than two (2) times in any twelve-month period. 1.7. selection of underwriters. the sponsor(s) selling a majority of the registrable securities to be sold by all sponsors in a demand registration will have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering, provided that such selection will be subject to the approval of the board of directors of the company (the &#147;board&#148;), which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. 1.8. other registration rights. the company represents and warrants that it is not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any other agreement granting registration rights to any other person with respect to any equity securities of the company, other than this agreement. except as provided in this agreement, the company shall not grant to any person the right to request the company to register any equity securities of the company, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities, without majority sponsor approval 3 approving the grant of registration rights for such securities; provided that without such approval, subject to section 6, (a) the company may grant rights to other persons to participate in demand registrations and piggyback registrations so long as such rights are subordinate to the rights of the holders of registrable securities with respect to such demand registrations and piggyback registrations; and (b) the company may grant rights to other persons to request registrations so long as the holders of registrable securities are entitled to participate in any such registrations with such persons pro rata on the basis of the number of common stock owned by each such holder. 2. piggyback registrations. 2.1. right to piggyback. whenever the company proposes to register any of its equity securities under the securities act (other than (a) pursuant to a demand registration, (b) in connection with registration on form s-4 or form s-8 or any successor or similar form or (c) in connection with the registration of shares on form s-3 with respect to a dividend reinvestment plan) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities (a &#147;piggyback registration&#148;), the company will give prompt written notice to all holders of registrable securities of its intention to effect such a registration and, subject to sections 2.3 and 2.4 below, will include in such registration all registrable securities with respect to which the company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 15 days after the delivery of the company&#146;s notice. each such company notice shall specify the approximate number of company equity securities to be registered and the anticipated per share price range for such offering. 2.2. piggyback expenses. the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with all piggyback registrations, whether or not any such registration becomes effective. 2.3. priority on primary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the company and the managing underwriter(s) advises the company that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering, the company will include in such registration: (a) first, the securities the company proposes to sell, (b) second, the registrable securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata (based on the number of shares requested to be registered) among the holders of such registrable securities, and (c) third, the other securities requested to be included in the such registration in the manner determined by the company and such shareholders. 2.4. priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of company securities (other than the holders of registrable securities), and the managing underwriter(s) advises the company that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the company will include in such registration: (a) first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting registration, (b) second, securities requested by the company to be included in such registration, and (c) third, registrable securities and other securities 4 requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the holders of such registrable securities and the holders of such other securities permitted to have their securities included in such registration on the basis of the number of shares owned by each such holder. 3. registration generally. 3.1. registration procedures. whenever the holders of registrable securities have requested that any registrable securities be registered pursuant to this agreement, the company will use its best efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and pursuant thereto the company will as expeditiously as reasonably practicable: (a) prepare and (within 60 days after the end of the period within which requests for inclusion in such registration may be given to the company) file with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective (provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the company will furnish to counsel selected by the sponsors owning the registrable securities to be included in any demand registration copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to review by such counsel); (b) prepare and file with the securities and exchange commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary (i) to keep such registration statement effective for a period (a) of not less than 180 days (subject to extension pursuant to section 3.3(b)) or, if such registration statement relates to an underwritten offering, such longer period as in the opinion of counsel for the underwriters a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of registrable securities by an underwriter or dealer, or (b) in the case of a shelf registration, ending on the earliest of (i) the date on which all registrable securities have been sold pursuant to the shelf registration or have otherwise ceased to be registrable securities, (ii) the second anniversary of the effective date of such shelf registration, (iii) such other date determined by the majority sponsors and (iv) when all such registrable securities are freely saleable under rule 144(k) under the securities act, and (ii) to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement until such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement; (c) cause (i) any issuer free writing prospectus to comply with the information and legending requirements under paragraph (c) of rule 433 and to be accompanied or preceded by a statutory prospectus to the extent required under rule 433, and (ii) any free writing prospectus or issuer information contained in a free writing prospectus required to be filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission under paragraph (d) under rule 433 to be so filed in accordance with such requirements; 5 (d) furnish to each seller of registrable securities such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, in each case, to the extent not available on edgar, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), each free writing prospectus used in connection with such registration, and such other documents as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such seller, but in all cases only if such documents are not available on edgar; (e) use its best efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such states as any seller reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the registrable securities owned by such seller (provided that the company will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subsection, (ii) subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction); (f) promptly notify each seller of such registrable securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, upon discovery that, or upon the discovery of the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and, at the request of any such seller, the company will prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the prospective purchasers of such registrable securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (g) use best efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange or market system on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed and, if not so listed, to be listed on the nasd

provided, however, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such registration statement, any such prospectus, preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information prepared and furnished to the company by such holder expressly for use therein. in connection with an underwritten offering, the company will indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. 4.2. indemnification by holders of registrable securities. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder will furnish to the company in writing such information and affidavits as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement, prospectus or free writing prospectus, and, to the extent permitted by law, will indemnify and hold harmless the company and its indemnitees against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the company or any such indemnitee may become subject under the securities act, equivalent foreign securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or in any application, together with any documents incorporated therein by reference or (b) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, any such prospectus, preliminary prospectus or 12 free writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information prepared and furnished to the company by such holder expressly for use therein, and such holder will reimburse the company and each such indemnitee for any legal or any other expenses including any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the consent of such holder, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify will be individual (and not joint and several) to each holder and will be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement, less any other amounts paid by such holder in respect of such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission. 4.3. procedure. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (a) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give such notice), and (b) unless in such indemnified party&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. 4.4. entry of judgment; settlement. the indemnifying party shall not, except with the approval of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to each indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation without any payment or consideration provided by such indemnified party. 4.5. contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 4 is, other than expressly pursuant to its terms, unavailable to or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under the provisions above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (a) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company on the one hand and the sellers of registrable securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other hand from the sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registered offering of securities as to which indemnity is sought or (b) if the allocation provided by clause (a) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits referred to in clause (a) above but also the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the sellers of registrable securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other hand in connection with the statement or omissions which resulted in such 13 losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the company on the one hand and the sellers of registrable securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) to the company bear to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) to the sellers of registrable securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the sellers of registrable securities and any other sellers participating in the registration statement on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or by the sellers of registrable securities or other sellers participating in the registration statement and the parties&#146;

(e) letter-of-credit rights. if any grantor is at any time a beneficiary under a letter of credit now or hereafter issued in favor of such grantor, such grantor shall promptly notify the collateral agent thereof and, at the request and option of the collateral agent, such grantor shall, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the collateral agent, either (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the issuer and any confirmer of such letter of credit to consent to an assignment to the collateral agent of the proceeds of any drawing under the letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the collateral agent to become the transferee beneficiary of the letter of credit, with the collateral agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any drawing under the letter of credit are to be paid to the applicable grantor unless an event of default has occurred or is continuing. (f) commercial tort claims. if any grantor shall at any time hold or acquire a commercial tort claim in an amount reasonably estimated to exceed $50,000, the grantor shall promptly notify the collateral agent thereof in a writing signed by such grantor including a summary description of such claim and grant to the collateral agent, for the ratable benefit of the secured parties, in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance satisfactory to the collateral agent. section 4.05. covenants regarding patent, trademark and copyright collateral. (a) each grantor agrees that it will not, and will not permit any of its licensees to, do any act, or omit to do any act, whereby any patent that is material to the conduct of such grantor&#146;s business may become invalidated or dedicated to the public, and agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mark any products covered by a patent with the relevant patent number as necessary and sufficient to establish and preserve its maximum rights under applicable patent laws. (b) each grantor (either itself or through its licensees or its sublicensees) will, for each trademark material to the conduct of such grantor&#146;s business, (i) maintain 20 such trademark in full force free from any claim of abandonment or invalidity for non-use, (ii) maintain the quality of products and services offered under such trademark, (iii) display such trademark with notice of federal or foreign registration to the extent necessary and sufficient to establish and preserve its maximum rights under applicable law and (iv) not knowingly use or knowingly permit the use of such trademark in violation of any third party rights. (c) each grantor (either itself or through its licensees or sublicensees) will, for each work covered by a material copyright, continue to publish, reproduce, display, adopt and distribute the work with appropriate copyright notice as necessary and sufficient to establish and preserve its maximum rights under applicable copyright laws. (d) each grantor shall notify the collateral agent promptly if it knows or has reason to know that any patent, trademark or copyright material to the conduct of its business may become abandoned, lost or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the united states patent and trademark office, united states copyright office or any court or similar office of any country) regarding such grantor&#146;s ownership of any patent, trademark or copyright, its right to register the same, or its right to keep and maintain the same (other than non-final office action in the course of prosecution). (e) in no event shall any grantor, either itself or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, file an application for any patent, trademark or copyright (or for the registration of any trademark or copyright) with the united states patent and trademark office, united states copyright office or any office or agency in any political subdivision of the united states or in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, unless it promptly notifies the collateral agent (which notice may be given after such filing), and, upon request of the collateral agent, executes and delivers any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the collateral agent may reasonably request to evidence the security interest in such patent, trademark or copyright, and each grantor hereby appoints the collateral agent as its attorney-in-fact to execute and file such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; such power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until the termination or release, pursuant to section 7.16 hereof, of the lien created hereunder. (f) each grantor will take all reasonably necessary steps that are consistent with the practice in any proceeding before the united states patent and trademark office, united states copyright office or any office or agency in any political subdivision of the united states or in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain and pursue each material application relating to the patents, trademarks and/or copyrights (and to obtain the relevant grant or registration) and to maintain each issued patent and each registration of the trademarks and copyrights that is material to the conduct of any grantor&#146;s business, including timely filings of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability and payment of maintenance fees, and, if consistent with good business judgment, to initiate opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings against third parties. 21 (g) in the event that any grantor knows or has reason to believe that any article 9 collateral consisting of a patent, trademark or copyright material to the conduct of any grantor&#146;s business has been or is about to be infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third person in a material respect, such grantor promptly shall notify the collateral agent and shall, if desirable in such grantor&#146;s business judgment, promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution, and take such other actions as are appropriate under the circumstances to protect such article 9 collateral. (h) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, each grantor shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals by the licensor of each copyright license, patent license or trademark license, and each other material license, to effect the assignment of all such grantor&#146;s right, title and interest thereunder to the collateral agent, for the ratable benefit of the secured parties, or its designee. article v remedies section 5.01. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, each grantor agrees to deliver each item of collateral to the collateral agent on demand, and it is agreed that the collateral agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any article 9 collateral consisting of intellectual property, on demand, to cause the security interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such article 9 collateral by the applicable grantor to the collateral agent, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such article 9 collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the collateral agent shall reasonably determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the article 9 collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the article 9 collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the article 9 collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the uniform commercial code or other applicable law. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each grantor agrees that the collateral agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker&#146;s board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the collateral agent shall deem appropriate. the collateral agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the collateral agent shall have the 22 right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the collateral so sold. each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor, and each grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. the collateral agent shall give each applicable grantor 10 days&#146; written notice (which each grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of section 9-611 of the new york ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the collateral agent&#146;s intention to make any sale of collateral. such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker&#146;s board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the collateral agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. at any such sale, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the collateral agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. the collateral agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such collateral shall have been given. the collateral agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. in case any sale of all or any part of the collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the collateral so sold may be retained by the collateral agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the collateral agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such collateral may be sold again upon like notice. at any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this agreement, any secured party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by applicable law), the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such secured party from any grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such secured party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. for purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the collateral agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the collateral agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the obligations paid in full. as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the collateral agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this agreement and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a 23 judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. any sale pursuant to the provisions of this section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in section 9-610(b) of the new york ucc or its equivalent in other jurisdictions. section 5.02. application of proceeds. the collateral agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other realization upon any collateral, including any collateral consisting of cash, as follows: first, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the administrative agent or the collateral agent (in their respective capacities as such hereunder or under any other loan document) in connection with such collection, sale, foreclosure or realization or otherwise in connection with this agreement, any other loan document or any of the obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the administrative agent and/or the collateral agent hereunder or under any other loan document on behalf of any grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other loan document; second, to the payment in full of all other obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the secured parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); third, to the grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. the collateral agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this agreement. upon any sale of collateral by the collateral agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the collateral agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the collateral agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. section 5.03. grant of license to use intellectual property. for the purpose of enabling the collateral agent to exercise rights and remedies under this agreement at such time as the collateral agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each grantor hereby grants to the collateral agent an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the grantors), to use, license or sublicense any of the article 9 collateral consisting of intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired by such grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, subject, in the case of trademarks, to the 24 observance of standards of quality and inspection in connection with the use of such trademarks as are sufficient to maintain the validity and enforceability of such trademarks. the use of such license by the collateral agent may be exercised, at the option of the collateral agent, only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default; provided, however, that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the collateral agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon each grantor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an event of default. section 5.04. securities act, etc. in view of the position of the grantors in relation to the pledged collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the u.s. securities act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the &#147;federal securities laws&#148;) with respect to any disposition of the pledged collateral permitted hereunder. each grantor understands that compliance with the federal securities laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the collateral agent if the collateral agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the pledged collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any pledged collateral could dispose of the same. similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the collateral agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the pledged collateral under applicable &#147;blue sky&#148; or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. each grantor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the collateral agent may, with respect to any sale of the pledged collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such pledged collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such pledged collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the federal securities laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a limited number of potential purchasers (including a single potential purchaser) to effect such sale. each grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. in the event of any such sale, the collateral agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the pledged collateral at a price that the collateral agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. the provisions of this section 5.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the collateral agent sells. 25 article vi indemnity, subrogation and subordination section 6.01. indemnity and subrogation. in addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the subsidiary guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to section 6.03), the borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any subsidiary guarantor under this agreement, the borrower shall indemnify such subsidiary guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such subsidiary guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any subsidiary guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this agreement or any other security document to satisfy in whole or in part a claim of any secured party, the borrower shall indemnify such subsidiary guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold. section 6.02. contribution and subrogation. each subsidiary guarantor (a &#147;contributing subsidiary guarantor&#148;) agrees (subject to section 6.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other subsidiary guarantor hereunder in respect of any obligation, or assets of any other subsidiary guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any security document to satisfy any obligation owed to any secured party, and such other subsidiary guarantor (the &#147;claiming subsidiary guarantor&#148;) shall not have been fully indemnified by the borrower as provided in section 6.01, the contributing subsidiary guarantor shall indemnify the claiming subsidiary guarantor in an amount equal to (i) the amount of such payment or (ii) the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the contributing subsidiary guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the subsidiary guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any subsidiary guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to section 7.16, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such subsidiary guarantor). any contributing subsidiary guarantor making any payment to a claiming subsidiary guarantor pursuant to this section 6.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of such claiming subsidiary guarantor under section 6.01 to the extent of such payment. section 6.03. subordination. (a) notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, all rights of the subsidiary guarantors under sections 6.01 and 6.02 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations. no failure on the part of the borrower or any subsidiary guarantor to make the payments required by sections 6.01 and 6.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each subsidiary guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of its obligations hereunder. 26 (b) the borrower and each subsidiary guarantor hereby agree that all indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to the borrower or any subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of the obligations. article vii miscellaneous section 7.01. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in section 9.01 of the credit agreement. all communications and notices hereunder to any subsidiary guarantor shall be given to it in care of the borrower as provided in section 9.01 of the credit agreement. section 7.02. security interest absolute. all rights of the collateral agent hereunder, the security interest, the grant of a security interest in the pledged collateral and all obligations of each grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the credit agreement, any other loan document, any agreement with respect to any of the obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the credit agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement or instrument relating to the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any grantor in respect of the obligations or this agreement. section 7.03. survival of agreement. all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the loan parties in the loan documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement or any other loan document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the loan documents and the making of any loans, regardless of any investigation made by any lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the collateral agent or any lender may have had notice or knowledge of any default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the credit agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any loan or any fee or any other amount payable under any loan document is outstanding and unpaid. section 7.04. limitation by law. all rights, remedies and powers provided in this agreement may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this agreement are intended to be subject to all mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they shall not render this agreement invalid, unenforceable, in whole or in part, or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law. 27 section 7.05. binding effect; several agreement. this agreement shall become effective as to any loan party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such loan party shall have been delivered to the collateral agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the collateral agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such loan party and the collateral agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such loan party, the collateral agent and the other secured parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no loan party shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this agreement or the credit agreement. this agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each loan party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any loan party without the approval of any other loan party and without affecting the obligations of any other loan party hereunder. section 7.06. successors and assigns. whenever in this agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any grantor or the collateral agent that are contained in this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. section 7.07. collateral agent&#146;s fees and expenses; indemnification. (a) the parties hereto agree that the collateral agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder as provided in section 9.05 of the credit agreement. (b) without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other loan documents, each grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the collateral agent and the other indemnitees against, and hold each indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and related out of pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing or to the collateral, regardless of whether any indemnitee is a party thereto or whether initiated by a third party or by a loan party or any affiliate thereof; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee. to the extent permitted by applicable law, no grantor shall assert, and each grantor hereby waives any claim against any indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, 28 in connection with, or as a result of, this agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions or any loan or the use of proceeds thereof.
