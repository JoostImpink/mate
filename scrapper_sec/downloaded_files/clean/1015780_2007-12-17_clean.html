in addition, pursuant to the amended investment agreement, subject to receipt of an acceptance and approval by the ots of a rebuttal of a change of control submission filed by cig and certain affiliated entities, and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions (the "final closing"), the issuer will issue to wingate (or its assignee) 46,684,890 shares common stock (the "final common stock" and, together with the initial common stock and the additional common stock, the "purchased common stock") and $150,000,000 in aggregate additional principal amount of the issuer's 12.5% springing lien notes due 2017 (the "final springing lien notes" and, together with the initial springing lien notes, the "purchased springing lien notes") and wingate (or its assignee) will contribute to the issuer cash in the aggregate amount of $150,000,000. wingate has the right to assign all or a portion of the springing lien notes and common stock issuable at the final closing upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. effective as of the final closing or at such time as the ots approval has been obtained, the amended investment agreement provides the issuer's board of directors will be expanded by one member and the board of directors will appoint a nominee of wingate as a class iii member. this nominee must be reasonably acceptable to the nominating committee of the board of directors (which will not unreasonably withhold its consent). this right to nominate a director to the board of directors will terminate when wingate and its affiliates no longer own shares of common stock representing at least 5% of the common stock then outstanding. the amended investment agreement also contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities by the issuer and wingate and its affiliates customary for a transaction of this nature, as well as certain put and call rights relating to the springing lien notes and certain post-closing covenants. the post-closing covenants include wingate's agreement (on its and its affiliates' behalf) to refrain from (a)&#160;purchases of additional equity securities of the issuer for a specified period, (b) sales of the shares of purchased common stock to anyone other than a limited class of permitted transferees for six months following november 29, 2007 and (c) sales of more than a specified percentage of shares of purchased common stock to an agreed list of competitors of the issuer. &#160; &#160; 10&#160; the percentages reported in this schedule 13d are based upon 461,772,089 shares of common stock outstanding as of december 17, 2007 (423,749,462 shares of common stock outstanding as of november 29, 2007 (as represented by the issuer in the investment agreement), plus 10,000,000 shares of common stock acquired by the reporting persons on november 29, 2007, plus 4,840,430 shares of common stock acquired by certain affiliates of blackrock, inc. on november 29, 2007 (as reported in the issuer's form 8-k filed on december 4, 2007), plus 23,182,197 shares of common stock to which the reporting persons became entitled on december 12, 2007. &#160; &#160; &#160; cusip no. 269246104 &#160; page&#160;14 of 18 pages &#160; &#160; in connection with the issuance of the springing lien notes, the issuer and the bank of new york, as trustee, entered into the springing lien notes indenture, dated november 29, 2007 (the "indenture"). under the indenture, the issuer may issue up to $1,936,000,000 (plus capitalized interest, if any) aggregate principal amount of springing lien notes. the springing lien notes bear interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum and will mature on november 30, 2017. interest on the springing lien notes is payable in cash on may 31 and november 30 of each year beginning on may 31, 2008, provided, however, that the issuer may capitalize interest payable on interest payment dates occurring on or before may 31, 2010 under certain circumstances. &#160; the issuer may redeem the springing lien notes beginning on november 30, 2012 for redemption prices set forth in the indenture. in addition, prior to such date, the issuer may redeem a portion of the outstanding principal amount of springing lien notes using a portion of the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the springing lien notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the springing lien notes on the date of purchase, plus accrued interest. furthermore, prior to the eighteen-month anniversary of the final closing, the issuer may redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding principal amount of springing lien notes, at a premium set forth in the indenture, in connection with the issuer entering into a definitive agreement to consummate a change of control transaction. &#160; the springing lien notes are general senior obligations of the issuer and are not guaranteed by the subsidiaries through which the issuer currently conducts substantially all of its operations. the springing lien notes rank equal in right of payment with all of the issuer's existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness, and rank senior in right of payment to all of the issuer's existing and future subordinated indebtedness. the indenture will require the issuer to secure the springing lien notes in the future, up to the maximum amount of indebtedness as would not require any of the issuer's existing senior notes due 2011, 2013 or 2015 becoming secured equally and ratably with the springing lien notes, on the property and assets of the issuer and certain of its subsidiaries as set forth in the indenture. the issuer will also be required to cause its restricted subsidiaries to guarantee the notes on the date on which the issuer is first required to secure the springing lien notes or on the date on which such restricted subsidiaries guarantee other indebtedness of the issuer. &#160; the indenture contains several restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in the indentures governing the issuer's existing senior notes due 2011, 2013 and 2015, including, but not limited to the following: (i) limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness and issuances of preferred stock, (ii) limitations on restricted payments, (iii) limitations on distributions from regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (iv) limitations on the issuance or sale of capital stock of regulated subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries, (v) limitations on transactions with affiliates, (vi) limitations on asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions, (vii) limitations on future subsidiary guarantees and (viii) limitations on liens, subject in each case to certain exceptions. the indenture also contains a covenant requiring certain bank regulated subsidiaries to be "well capitalized" under applicable regulatory standards. &#160; &#160; cusip no. 269246104 &#160; page 15 of 18 pages &#160; the indenture contains customary terms that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the springing lien notes then outstanding may declare the principal of the springing lien notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration immediately due and payable. in the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency relating to the issuer or any of its significant subsidiaries, the principal amount of the springing lien notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable. the issuer and wingate are parties to a registration rights agreement, dated november 29, 2007 (the "registration rights agreement") containing customary terms and conditions for providing for the registration of the springing lien notes and purchased common stock issued to wingate and its affiliates pursuant to the amended investment agreement. in addition, as noted in item 4, on november 29, 2007, in connection with entering into the investment agreement, the issuer and the rights agent entered into the rights agreement amendment. &#160; in connection with the investment agreement, wingate and certain of its affiliates entered into certain additional transactions. the completion of these transactions is subject to certain conditions being satisfied. first, wingate (a 99%-owned subsidiary of cw) and cac (an entity that is indirectly minority owned by cw and indirectly majority owned by ckgsf) entered into an assignment agreement, dated november 29, 2007 (the "assignment agreement"), pursuant to which wingate (i)&#160;sold to cac all of the common stock that wingate was entitled to receive upon the initial closing and (ii)&#160;assigned to cac all of its rights under the amended investment agreement to obtain common stock of the company after the initial closing. the purchase price was $4.50 per share of common stock and was agreed to before the investment agreement was publicly announced. the purchase price is subject to adjustment in accordance with a fairness opinion to be obtained by the parties. second, wingate purchased from kensington financial investments ltd. ("kfil"), a subsidiary of ckgsf, six separate european style, cash settled otc options, each of which entitles it to put $250 million in face amount of the purchased springing lien notes to kfil at a strike price of $180 million (the "puts"). each put is exercisable on a different date between six months and twenty-one months from november 29, 2007. the aggregate initial premium for the puts was approximately $213,400,000 and is subject to adjustment based upon a fairness opinion to be obtained by the parties. the fairness opinions described in this paragraph have been obtained and resulted in no adjustment to the price of the common stock and resulted in a net increase of $84,000 in the aggregate initial premium for the puts. wingate's purpose for entering the transactions described in this paragraph was to reduce its economic risk. kfil's purpose for entering into the puts was to earn an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return at market prices. &#160; in connection with its submission to the ots to rebut the rebuttable determination of control with respect to the reporting persons' investment in the issuer, cig and certain affiliated entities have submitted for approval a proposed rebuttal agreement affirmatively disclaiming any intention to control the issuer. under the proposed rebuttal agreement, cig and certain affiliated entities will also commit that it and its affiliates will not, except as necessary solely in connection with the performance by their representative on the issuer&#8217;s board of directors, exercise or attempt to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management, policies or business operations of the issuer and will refrain from taking certain specific actions with respect to the business and corporate affairs of the issuer. the proposed rebuttal agreement would also preclude cig and its affiliates from, among other things, seeking or accepting representation of more than one member of the issuer&#8217;s board of directors. it is expected that the rebuttal agreement with the ots will be substantially in the form required by ots regulations at 12 cfr &#167;&#160;574.100. if accepted by the ots, the rebuttal agreement will be executed prior to the issuance of the final common stock and is expected to remain in effect so long as cig and its affiliates collectively own ten percent or more of the issuer&#8217;s voting securities. &#160;
