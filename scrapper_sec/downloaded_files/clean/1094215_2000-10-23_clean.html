cinergy ventures, llc, a delaware limited liability company ("cinergy"), and the parties listed on the signature pages hereto as management investors (the "management investors"). stc, cinergy and each management investor are individually referred to herein as an "investor" and, collectively, as the "investors"). capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the respective meanings given to them in the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the date of this agreement (the "merger agreement"), by and among parent, purchaser, stc and convergent group corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company"). whereas, the management investors and cinergy (the "contributing stockholders") wish to contribute certain shares (the "exchange shares") of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "company common stock"), of the company in exchange for shares of parent's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "parent shares"); whereas, stc wishes to contribute a certain amount of cash to parent in exchange for parent shares; and whereas, the parties intend that, for federal income tax purposes, the contributions contemplated by this agreement will constitute transfers of property in exchange for parent shares that qualify for nonrecognition under section 351 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: section 1. purchase and sale of

(a) subject to the terms and conditions hereof, parent shall issue to stc (or one or more designated subsidiaries or affiliates of stc, the "cash investors"), a number of parent shares, in consideration of the cash investors' contribution to parent of the amount of cash per parent share set forth on schedule i hereto. stc shall subscribe for that number of parent shares such that the proceeds from its purchase equals (i) the purchase price for all shares of company common stock accepted for purchase in the offer, (ii) the merger consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement, (iii) the purchase price for all parent shares purchased by parent pursuant to any of parent's agreements with the company's employees dated as of october 13, 2000, and (iv) the purchase price for all parent shares to be purchased pursuant to the stockholders' agreement (as defined below). (b) subject to the terms and conditions hereof, parent shall issue to each of the contributing stockholders the number of parent shares set forth opposite its name on schedule ii hereto, in consideration of each contributing stockholder's contribution to parent of the number of exchange shares set forth on schedule ii hereto. the value per share of such exchange shares transferred by each contributing stockholder to parent is set forth opposite its name on schedule ii hereto. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, parent reserves the right to reject any contributing stockholder's subscription for exchange shares in order to comply with the provisions of rule 506 under the securities act of 1933, as amended. (c) the issuances and sales referred to in sections 1(a) and 1(b) hereof shall be effected by parent executing and delivering to each investor duly executed certificates evidencing the parent shares to be subscribed by such investor, duly registered in such investor's name against delivery by such investor to parent of the consideration set forth opposite such investor's name on schedule i or ii. any cash payment shall be made by wire transfer. (d) the initial closing of the contribution (the "closing") shall take place upon the earlier of (i) one business day after the date on which convergent acquisition sub, inc., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent ("purchaser"), shall have accepted for payment the shares of company common stock tendered in the offer or (ii) april 30, 2001; provided, however that if the closing occurs, stc may purchase parent shares pursuant to section 1(a)(ii) and (iii) at any time after the closing and prior to or on the first anniversary of such date. the date of the closing is herein referred to as the "closing date." (e) in order to facilitate the contribution of the exchange shares by the contributing stockholders, each contributing stockholder shall deliver within fifteen business days of the date hereof one or more certificates representing all of the exchange shares to be contributed by such contributing stockholder to parent, together with stock powers or other instruments duly endorsed or otherwise sufficient for transfer (the "exchange instruments"). parent shall hold the exchange instruments in escrow pending the closing date. each contributing stockholder hereby authorizes the parent, on the closing date, to present the exchange instruments to the transfer agent for the company and instruct the transfer agent to register the exchange shares in the name of parent or its designee.

(b) parent shall pay the applicable redemption price in immediately available funds against delivery of the stock certificates representing the applicable shares (or, in lieu of delivery of lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, an agreement to indemnify parent from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates). if parent is prevented from redeeming or making full payment for the common stock by any legal or contractual restriction, -7- parent shall then redeem the maximum number of shares pro rata from the redeeming stockholders as permitted free from any legal or other restrictions, and stc shall purchase the remaining shares included in redemption demands for the redemption price. (c) this section 2.5 shall not be available when the drag-along right pursuant to section 2.2 has been initiated prior to the receipt of any redemption demand.

(c) if parent, cinergy and the management investors are unable to reach agreement as to the fair market value of the redeemed shares within such 30 day period, the fair market value of the redeemed shares shall be determined by an appraisal process as set forth herein. each of parent, on the one hand, and cinergy and the management investors on the other hand shall designate, within fifteen days after the conclusion of the thirty day negotiation period referred to above, an independent and experienced appraiser (each individually an "appraiser" and collectively the "appraisers"). the appraisers shall be instructed to complete their appraisals of the fair market value of the redeemed shares by no later than thirty days after their appointment. if the determination of the appraiser with the higher determination is not greater than 110% of the determination of the other appraiser, the fair market value shall be equal to the average of the determinations of the two appraisers; provided, however, if the higher determination is greater than 110% of the lower determination, then the two appraisers shall jointly select a third appraiser within ten days after the first date on which both of such two appraisers have delivered their reports. such third appraiser shall deliver its report of its good faith determination of the fair market value of the redeemed shares within thirty days after such appointment, and in such case the fair market value shall be equal to the average of the closest determinations; provided, however that if the highest and lowest of such three determinations differ from the middle determination by an equal amount, the fair market value shall be equal to such middle determination. the cost of all such appraisals shall be borne one- -8- half by parent and one-half by the redeeming stockholders (pro rata in accordance with such redeeming stockholder's ownership of redeemed shares) and the redeeming stockholders' share of such costs shall be withheld from the redemption price distributed to the redeeming stockholders. section 2.7 put option.

(c) each stockholder exercising their put rights under this section 2.7 shall deliver to parent or stc, as the case may be, at a closing to be held at the offices of parent on the fifth business day following parent's receipt of notice of such stockholder's exercise of its put rights under this section 2.7 (or such other date and place as the parties agree), one or more certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent all the shares owned by such stockholder, and each such stockholder shall make such representations and warranties, and shall enter into such agreements, as are customary and reasonable given each such stockholder's percentage ownership in the parent in the context of the proposed sale, including without limitation representations and warranties (and indemnities with respect thereto) that the transferee of the shares (or interests therein) is receiving title to such shares (or interests therein), free and clear of all pledges, security interests, adverse claims, other liens or restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws). article iii. market stand-off; registration rights section 3.1 market stand-off.

(a) in connection with any registration of any registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, the parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, each underwriter, broker or any other person acting on behalf of the holders of registrable securities and each other person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing persons within the meaning of the securities act (each such indemnified person being referred to herein as an "indemnified person") against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several (or actions in respect -15- thereof), to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in or incorporated by reference in the registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act, prospectus contained therein or otherwise filed with the sec, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incident to registration or qualification of any registrable securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or, with respect to any prospectus, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or any violation by the parent of the securities act or state securities or blue sky laws applicable to the parent and relating to action or inaction required of the parent in connection with such registration or qualification under such state securities or blue sky laws; and shall promptly reimburse the indemnified persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the parent shall not be liable in any such case to any such indemnified person to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action (including any legal or other expenses incurred) arises out of or is based upon: (i) an untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in said registration statement, prospectus or document incident to registration or qualification of any registrable securities in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the parent through an instrument duly executed by such indemnified person specifically for use in the preparation thereof or (ii) any indemnified person's failure to deliver a copy of the prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto) after the parent has delivered to such indemnified person a sufficient number of copies of the same. (b) in connection with any registration of registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, each holder of registrable securities being registered shall, severally and not jointly, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in section 3.7(a) above) the parent, each director of the parent, each officer of the parent who shall have signed such registration statement, each other holder of registrable securities, each agent, underwriter, broker or other person acting on behalf of the parent, each other holder of registrable securities and each person who controls any of the foregoing persons within the meaning of the securities act with respect to any statement or omission from such registration statement, any prospectus contained therein or otherwise filed with the sec or any document incident to registration or qualification of any registrable securities, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the parent or such underwriter through an instrument duly executed by such holder specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or document; provided, however, that the maximum amount of liability in respect of such indemnification shall be limited, in the case of each seller of registrable securities, to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such seller from the sale of registrable securities effected pursuant to such registration. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified person of notice of the commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in section 3.7(a) or section 3.7(b), such indemnified person will, if a claim in respect thereof is made against an indemnifying -16- party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the indemnified person's failure to give such notice shall not release, relieve or in any way affect the indemnifying party's obligation hereunder to indemnify the indemnified person unless and to the extent that the rights of the indemnifying party are prejudiced thereby. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified person, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume and control the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that he, she, or it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified person of his, her or its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified person in connection with the defense thereof, provided, however, that if any indemnified person shall have reasonably concluded (based on the written advice of counsel) that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified person which are additional to or conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party and such indemnifying party shall reimburse such indemnified person for that portion of the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the indemnified party which is reasonably incurred in connection with the matters covered by the indemnity agreement provided in this section 3.7. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 3.7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein (other than as a result of the applicability of the proviso in section 3.7(a)), then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified person hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified person as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified person and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. section 3.7 underwriting agreement.

statement and to the extent customary given their role in such distribution. -17- (b) no stockholder may participate in any registration hereunder that is underwritten unless such stockholder agrees to (i) sell such stockholder's registrable securities proposed to be included therein on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the parent and a majority of the registrable securities being included in such registration and (ii) as expeditiously as possible, notify the parent of the occurrence of any event concerning such stockholder as a result of which the prospectus relating to such registration contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. section 3.8 exchange act compliance. from the registration date or such earlier date as a registration statement filed by the parent

to "registrable securities" shall be deemed to include the shares of common stock, if any, or other securities that the stockholders would be entitled to receive in exchange for common stock under any such merger, consolidation or reorganization; provided, however, that, to the extent the stockholders receive securities that are by their terms convertible into shares of common stock of the issuer thereof, then any such shares of common stock as are issued or issuable upon conversion of said convertible securities shall be included within the definition of "registrable securities." section 3.10

exhibit b to subscription and contribution agreement investor rights agreement investor rights agreement, dated as of _______ __, 2000 (this "agreement"), by and among convergent holding corporation, a delaware corporation ("parent"), schlumberger technology corp., a texas corporation ("stc") and cinergy ventures, llc ("cinergy"). w i t n e s s e t h: whereas, cinergy desires to enter into an arrangement concerning the right of cinergy to demand redemption of the shares of common stock owned by cinergy on the date of this agreement (the "shares"); and whereas, parent, cinergy, stc and certain management investors have entered into a stockholders' agreement governing matters such as the transfer and registration of the shares (as hereafter defined), operation and governance of parent and other related matters (the "stockholders' agreement"); and whereas, parent, stc, cinergy and certain management investors have entered into a subscription and contribution agreement providing for the initial capitalization of parent (the "subscription agreement"). now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: section 1. redemption. notwithstanding section 2.5 of the stockholders' agreement, cinergy shall be entitled to the following right of redemption. (a) parent shall cause the fair market value per share to be determined as of the third anniversary of the date hereof in accordance with section 2. when the fair market value per share has been determined, parent shall promptly notify (the "redemption notice") cinergy of such fair market value. cinergy shall have thirty days following the receipt of the redemption notice in which to deliver to parent a written redemption demand (a "redemption demand") that parent shall redeem all, or any portion of, the common stock (as requested in the redemption demand), for a per share purchase price (the "redemption price") equal to the greater of (i) the fair market value or (ii) $8.00. the closing of such purchase and sale shall occur at the offices of parent on such business day reasonably selected by parent, but not on a date less than forty days nor more than 90 days after delivery of the redemption notice (the "redemption date"). from and after the redemption date, the rights of cinergy as a stockholder of parent, with respect to any shares redeemed, shall cease and the certificates representing the redeemed shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable redemption price upon surrender of such certificates to parent. (b) parent shall pay the applicable redemption price in immediately available funds against delivery of the stock certificates representing the applicable shares (or, in lieu of delivery of lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, an agreement to indemnify parent from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates). if parent is prevented from redeeming or making full payment for the shares by any legal or contractual restriction, parent shall then redeem the maximum number of shares from cinergy as permitted free from any legal or other restrictions and stc shall purchase the remaining shares included in redemption demands for the redemption price. (c) stc shall cause parent to fully, faithfully and timely perform the parent's obligations under this section 1. section 2. determination of fair market value; payment for shares. for purposes of
