(a) the purchaser may at any time after the date one year from the date hereof request in writing that the company register under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act") all or any portion of the registrable stock (as defined below) for sale in the manner specified in such notice; and provided, that the aggregate purchase price to the public of such public offering of the shares of registrable stock for which registration has been requested shall reasonably be anticipated to exceed $1 million; and provided, further that (i) the company shall not be obligated to register purchaser's registrable stock pursuant to this paragraph (a) on more than one occasion, and (ii) the company shall not be obligated to effect a shelf registration as such is defined in rule 415 under the securities act. (b) following receipt of any notice delivered in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section 1 (a "demand"), the company shall use its best efforts to register under the securities act, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such demand, the number of shares of registrable stock specified in such demand. purchaser may request a specific managing underwriter or underwriters, which shall be of national standing, subject to the approval of the company, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or unreasonably delayed. the company shall be deemed to have satisfied an obligation to register registrable stock pursuant to a demand when a registration statement covering at least 90% of the shares of registrable stock specified in the demand for sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in the demand shall have become effective and the period of distribution of the registration contemplated thereby has been completed(determined as hereinafter provided). (c) the company shall be entitled to include in any registration statement filed in response to a demand made in accordance with this section 1, for sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified by the purchaser in such demand, shares of common stock to be sold by the company for its own account or that of other security holders, except as and to the extent that, in the opinion of the managing underwriters, such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the registrable stock, or the price thereof or the number of shares to be included for which registration has been requested in connection with such demand. except for registration statements on from s-4, s-8 or any successor forms thereto, the company will not file with the securities and exchange commission (the "commission") any other registration statement with respect to its common stock, whether for its own account or that of other security page holders, from the date of receipt of a demand pursuant to this section 1 until 45 days following the completion of the period of distribution of the registration contemplated thereby (determined as hereinafter provided). (d) the company may at its option elect that any requested registration pursuant to section 1(a) be delayed for a period not in excess of 90 days from the date of such demand but only if, at the time of such request, the company is engaged in a transaction which is material to the company and the disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect on the company. (e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 1, no demand may be made within 90 days after the effective date of a registration statement filed by the company covering a firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the purchaser shall have been entitled to join pursuant to section 2 hereof and in which there shall have been effectively registered at least 50% of the shares of registrable stock as to which registration shall, if any, have been requested. section 2. incidental registration.

(c) furnish to each seller of registrable stock and to each underwriter such number of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) as such persons reasonably may request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the registrable stock covered by such registration statement;

(g) enter into such reasonable agreements (including an underwriting agreement, if applicable) which shall be customary in form, substance and scope for such an arrangement between such underwriter and companies of the company's size and investment stature and take all such other reasonable actions in connection therewith in order to expedite and facilitate the disposition of the registrable stock to be registered; (h) whether or not the offering is underwritten and at the request of any seller of registrable stock, (i) furnish such reasonable representations and warranties to such seller and the underwriters, if any, as are customary in primary underwritten offerings and (ii) use best efforts to obtain (a) an opinion of counsel representing the company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to such seller in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering and to such other effects as reasonably may be requested by counsel for the underwriters or by such seller or its counsel and (b) a letter dated such date from the independent public accountants retained by the company, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to such seller, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, and such letter to additionally cover such other financial matters (including information as to the period ending no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter) with respect to such registration as such underwriters reasonably may request;
