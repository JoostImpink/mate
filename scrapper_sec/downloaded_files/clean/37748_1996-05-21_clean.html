investment cost of the 4,400,000 shares (the "shares") of new common stock owned by fluor daniel is estimated to be in the range of $54 million to $60 million, based on a summary valuation prepared by the company's financial advisor. this investment consists of $33,350,000 in cash and in addition, effective may 10, 1996, fluor daniel environmental services, inc., a california corporation ("fdesi"), a wholly owned subsidiary of fluor daniel, was transferred to the company pursuant to a merger of fdesi into gti acquisition corporation, a california corporation ("newco"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. fluor daniel used funds from its ultimate parent, fluor, to purchase the shares. pursuant to the certain stock option agreement dated as of december 11, 1995 between the company and fluor daniel (the "option agreement"), which is attached hereto as exhibit 3, the company sold to fluor daniel for a cash payment of --------- $1,650,000 an option to purchase up to an additional 1,366,000 shares of the company's common stock (the "common stock") or, if exercised after the closing of the transaction, the new common stock (the "base shares"), at a purchase price in cash of $17.00 per share (the "per share price"), or $1,650,000 for all of the base shares, with both the base shares and per share price subject to adjustment as described in item 4 below. fluor daniel has not attempted to arrange financing for the purchase of the base shares. item 4. purchase of transaction. ----------------------- the purpose of the purchase of the shares was for fluor daniel to obtain control of the company. the board of directors for fluor daniel, and the board of directors of its ultimate parent corporation, fluor, considered a number of factors in connection with its acquisition of the shares, including, without limitation, the following: (i) a review of the company, including a presentation by fluor daniel's management regarding its due diligence review of the company; (ii) a review of advice of management, financial and legal advisors regarding the terms of that certain investment agreement dated december 11, 1995 by and among fluor daniel, fdesi, the page 10 of --- company and newco (the "investment agreement") which is attached hereto as exhibit 2, and the transactions contemplated thereby (the "transaction"); - --------- (iii) fluor daniel's existing position in the environmental service industry and its desire to strengthen and expand its presence in the industry; (iv) quality, diversity and experience of the personnel of the company, and (v) the company's experience in the environmental services industry which would be complimentary to the needs of fluor daniel, including the company's extensive experience in remediation services utilizing a wide spectrum of technologies. in addition, the analysis included advice from fluor daniel's financial advisors concerning the (i) the historical results of the company; (ii) the potential for growth and earnings of the company following the proposed transaction; (iii) historical market prices and trading volumes of the company's common stock; (iv) comparable merger or acquisition transactions; and (v) ranges of estimates of value of the company based on various analysis. the fluor daniel board also considered the transactions prospective impact on fluor's earnings per share, as well as opportunities for cost savings. the fluor daniel board also focused on the revenue enhancements expected to result from the transactions and the respective contributions the parties would bring to the combined corporation. the fluor daniel board did not assign any specific or relative weight to the factors under its consideration. the fluor daniel board determined that the transactions were in the best interest of fluor daniel and fluor. on december 11, 1995 fluor daniel and the company entered into the option agreement. pursuant to the option agreement, the company sold to fluor daniel for a cash payment of $1,650,000 the option to purchase up to 1,366,000 shares of common stock or, if exercised after the closing of the transaction, the new common stock at a per share exercise price of $17.00 per share, with both the base shares and the per share price subject to adjustment as described below (the base shares, as adjusted are herein referred to as the "optioned shares"). exercise of the option. the option will become exercisable after the first to occur of (i) december 11, 1996 and (ii) fluor daniel being entitled to terminate the investment agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. once exercisable, the option may be exercised in whole or in part prior to its expiration by delivery by fluor daniel to the company of a written notice (the "notice") specifying the number of optioned shares to be purchased and a place and date (the "option closing date") not later than 10 business days from the date of the notice for the closing of such purchase (the "option closing"), provided that if any approvals are required under the hsr act with respect to such exercise, the option closing will be the later of (i) the option closing date specified in the notice and (ii) the next business day following the date on which the applicable waiting periods under the hsr act shall have expired. the option expires on december 11, 1998. page 11 of --- adjustment to base shares and per share price. in connection with the recapitalization of the company (so long as the option is not exercised in full prior to the closing of the transaction), the aggregate number of shares purchasable upon exercise of the option will be adjusted by multiplying the base shares by the adjustment fraction (as defined below). the per share price will be adjusted by dividing the per share price by the adjustment fraction. the term "adjustment fraction" means a fraction, the numerator of which equals the current market price of the common stock and the denominator of which equals the current market price of the new common stock. for purposes of the option, the "current market price" means the average per share closing price for the five trading days (i) immediately preceding the closing of the transaction, with respect to the common stock, and (ii) immediately following the closing of the transaction, with respect to the new common stock. these adjustments have been made and the number of shares subject to the option is 1,768,970 at an exercise price of $13.1274 per share. the number of optioned shares and the per share price are also subject to adjustment upon any change in the outstanding shares of common stock or new common stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the company (other than the recapitalization of the company) to maintain without dilution the rights of fluor daniel under the option. registration rights. under the option agreement, fluor daniel is entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the optioned shares. at any time within three years of any option closing, the company is obligated (i) to effect up to two registrations under the securities act (each a "demand registration") of any or all of the optioned shares, one of which such registrations may, at fluor daniel's request, so long as the company satisfies the eligibility requirements of form s-3 under the securities act, be required to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act and (ii) at the written request of fluor daniel delivered within ten (10) days after the company delivers a notice to fluor daniel of the company's intent to file a registration statement for its common stock, to include any or all of the optioned shares in such registration (each an "incidental registration"). fluor daniel may not request a demand registration within 120 days following the effective date of a registration statement filed by the company in which the optioned shares were entitled to join. in an incidental registration, upon the written opinion of the managing underwriter that the requested distribution of optioned shares would adversely effect the distribution of securities of the company, the company may, at its option, either (x) require fluor daniel to agree to delay the offering and sale of the optioned shares for a reasonable period as requested by the managing underwriter or (y) include in the registration statement only such portion, if any, of the optioned shares as the managing underwriter advises may be so included. in addition, the company is page 12 of ____ entitled to suspend any obligation to register optioned shares for 90 days in any 12-month period if there exists material non-public information about the company which, in the reasonable opinion of the company, should not be disclosed. under the option agreement, each of fluor daniel and the company agree to indemnify the other for all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of statements or omissions of the other contained in any registration statement (and related prospectus). pursuant to the investment agreement the company filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation on may 10, 1996, which amended article fourth of the company's restated certificate of incorporation to authorize 25,000,000 shares of new common stock and establish the terms thereof and to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of common stock into the right to receive $8.62 in cash and .5274 of a share of new common stock pursuant to the transaction. under article fourth the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the new common stock are identical in all respects to those of the common stock, except the par value of the new common stock is $.001 per share. in addition, the company's restated certificate of incorporation amended (a) article first to change the company's name to "fluor daniel gti, inc.", (b) article third to maximize the legally permissible purposes of the company under delaware law and (c) to delete article sixth, which contained provisions regarding a classified board of directors. pursuant to the investment agreement, the company's stockholders approved on may 10, 1996, certain amendments to the company's bylaws to, among other things, amend article 2 (meeting of shareholders), article 3 (directors), article 4 (meeting of the board of directors), article 7 (officers), article 8 (resignations, removals and vacancies) and article 15 (amendments). amended article 2 of the bylaws provides that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the written request of the majority of directors then in office. amended article 3 of the bylaws set the size of the board of directors at no more than seven members and eliminates the provision allowing enlargement of the board by a majority vote of the board or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of the directors. article 3 has also been amended to eliminate the classified board of directors, such that the term of office of each director shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders. amended article 4 of the bylaws specifies that a quorum of the board for the transaction of business shall be a majority of the board, except as otherwise provided in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the bylaws. amended article 7 of the bylaws specifies that the board shall have a chairman of the board who shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and of the board of directors. amended article 8 of the bylaws provides that any or all directors may be page 13 of ____ removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, unless otherwise specified by law or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation. amended article 8 also eliminates provisions relating to the classified board structure to conform to amended article 3. amended article 15 of the bylaws provides that the bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws adopted, by the stockholders or by a majority of the full board of directors (whether or not present at a meeting). the bylaws were also amended throughout to reflect the change in the company's name to "fluor daniel gti, inc." and to reference the amended and restated certificate of incorporation rather than the restated certificate of incorporation. pursuant to the investment agreement, the amended bylaws provide for a board of directors with no more than seven members, with each director to service until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or his or her early resignation or removal. as of may 10, 1996 the directors of the company are as follows: walter c. barber, former chairman, president and chief executive officer of the company; alan s. bufferd and robert p. schechter, formerly independent directors of the company; david l. myers, j. michal conaway and james c. stein, who are members of fluor management; and ernie green, an independent director designated by fluor. in addition, three new vice presidents of the company were elected, rhonnie smith, john wood and don stokely, all former members of fdesi management. except as described herein and more fully set forth in the option agreement and the investment agreement, neither fluor daniel, fd engineers nor fluor presently have any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition of additional securities, or disposition of securities, of the company; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) the sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the insured; (f) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the company's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or any actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person; (h) causing any class of securities of the company be delisted from a national securities exchange or cease being authorized to be quoted in a deal of quotation of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equities page 14 of _____ securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(iv) of the act; or (j) any similar action in any of those numerated above. each of fluor daniel, fd engineers and fluor intends to continually review the company's business

continue to provide environmental assessment, remediation and monitoring services. the marketing agreement provides that the company will have primary responsibility for the marketing and execution of environmental services and fluor daniel will have primary responsibility for marketing and execution of total business solutions services. fluor daniel will promote the use of the company, and will retain the company on a sole-source basis, for environmental services that are related or incidental to fluor daniel's engineering and construction business and total business solutions business,

proposed commercial terms are competitive with the market. in addition, the company and fluor daniel will provide overhead support and contract support services to each other on an intercompany basis. the company will use the page 16 of _____ name "fluor daniel gti, inc." during the term of the marketing agreement, and subsidiaries of the company may also use a similar name if the parties decide it is useful in marketing the operations of the company's subsidiaries. the term of the marketing arrangement is ten years from the closing of the transaction unless further extended by the parties. in the event fluor daniel ceases to own at least 20% of the issued and outstanding equity of the company, then (a) fluor daniel, provided it is not in breach of its obligations pursuant to section 6.2(d) of the investment agreement (with respect to dispositions of new common stock held by it), or the company may terminate the marketing agreement prior to expiration of the term; and (b) fluor daniel, pursuant to section 7.9 of the investment agreement, may revoke the license of the company and its subsidiaries to use the name "fluor daniel" in the company's corporate name. the investment agreement

(c) no fraction of a share of new common stock will be issued in the recapitalization, but, in lieu thereof, each holder of old common stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of new common stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of new common stock to be received by the holder) will be entitled to receive from the company an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the fraction multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price of the old common stock on the nasdaq national market for the five days immediately prior to the closing date. section 1.4 no post-closing transfers. no transfer of shares of old common stock of the company shall be made from and after the closing. if, after the closing date, certificates

certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and properly executed in accordance with instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder shall be paid promptly, without interest thereon and subject to any required withholding of taxes, the amount of cash and new common stock to which such holder is entitled hereunder, and such certificate shall forthwith be canceled. until so surrendered and exchanged, each certificate which immediately prior to the closing date represented outstanding shares of the old common stock shall represent solely the right to receive the cash and new common stock into which the old common stock it theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to section 1.3(a), subject to any required withholding of taxes. if any payment for old common stock is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the certificates for such shares surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of such

(b) compliance with securities laws. none of the company, any of its ------------------------------- affiliates (as defined in the investment agreement) or anyone acting on its or their behalf has issued, sold or offered any security of the company to any person under circumstances that would cause the issuance and sale of the optioned shares, as contemplated by this agreement, to be subject to the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 (the "securities act"). assuming the representations of purchaser contained in section 4.14 of the investment agreement are true and correct on the date hereof and on the date of each closing at which optioned shares are purchased, the issuance, sale and delivery of the optioned shares hereunder are exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act. 5 (c) the optioned shares. the company has taken all necessary ------------------- corporate action to authorize and reserve for issuance upon exercise of the option 1,366,000 (as adjusted pursuant to section 1) shares of authorized but unissued old common stock or new common stock, as the case may be, including approval by the board of directors of the company. such approval by the board of directors of the company is intended to be and is sufficient to render inapplicable to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as well as any future acquisitions of old common stock or new common stock or other transactions involving the purchaser or any of its affiliates and the company, the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (whether or not this agreement is terminated). no vote is required by the holders of any securities of the company to approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 5. representations and warranties of the purchaser. ----------------------------------------------- (a) incorporation of the purchaser's representations and warranties --------------------------------------------------------------- by reference. the representation s and warranties of the purchaser contained in - ------------ article iv of the investment agreement are incorporated by reference into this agreement with the same effect as though set forth in full at this place.

recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the company (except for the reclassification of old common stock at the closing) that would have the effect of diluting the purchaser's rights hereunder, the number of optioned shares and the per share price shall be adjusted appropriately so as to restore the purchaser to its rights hereunder; provided, however, that nothing in this agreement shall be construed as permitting the company to take any action or enter into any transaction prohibited by the investment agreement, it being understood and agreed that section 6.3 of the investment agreement shall not restrict in any way the ability of the purchaser to exercise this option. 7. registration rights. upon the request of the purchaser at any time and ------------------- from time to time within three years of any closing hereunder, the company agrees

(i) of this section 7 may be made within 120 days after the effective date of a registration statement filed by the company in which the optioned shares have been entitled to join. so long as the company satisfies the eligibility requirements for use of a registration statement on form s-3 under the securities act, the purchaser may request one demand registration for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act and will file all supplements to the prospectus and take all other actions necessary to facilitate an offering thereunder. the company will use its best efforts to keep each such registration described above effective for a period of not less than one year (or, if sooner, until the purchaser shall have disposed of all of the optioned shares). notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the company's obligation to file a registration statement or to cause such registration to become and remain effective shall be suspended upon notice to purchaser for a period of up to 90 days in any 12-month period if there exists at the time material non-public information relating to the company which, in the reasonable opinion of the

registered for sale by the company would adversely affect the distribution of such securities by the company, then the company shall, at its option, either (x) include such optioned shares in the registration statement, but the purchaser shall agree to delay the offering and sale of such optioned shares for such period of time as the managing underwriter may reasonably request (provided that the purchaser may at any time withdraw its request to include optioned shares in such offering) or (y) include such portion, if any, of the optioned shares in the registration statement as the

information furnished to the company with respect to it specifically for use in the preparation of such documents by such indemnified persons). the purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the company, its affiliates and controlling persons and their respective officers, 9 directors, agents and representatives, and the underwriters for any such offering, in accordance with the
