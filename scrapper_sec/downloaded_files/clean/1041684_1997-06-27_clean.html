(c) a purchaser indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder shall give written notice to the company of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification promptly after the discovery by such party of any matters giving rise to a claim for indemnification; provided that the failure of any purchaser indemnitee to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the company of its obligations under this section 5.12 unless the company shall have been materially prejudiced by the failure of purchaser indemnitee to make such notification. in case any such action, suit, claim or proceeding is brought against purchaser indemnitee, the company shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to purchaser indemnitee, and after notice from the company of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the company will not be liable to such purchaser indemnitee under this section 5.12 for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such purchaser indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; provided that (i) if the company shall elect not to assume the defense of such claim or action or (ii) if purchaser indemnitee reasonably determines that there may be a conflict between the positions of the company and of purchaser indemnitee in defending such claim or 34 action, then separate counsel shall be entitled to participate in and conduct the defense, and the company shall be liable for any legal or other expenses incurred by purchaser indemnitee in connection with the defense; provided that in no event shall be company be required to pay the fees or expenses of more than one counsel. the company shall not be liable for any settlement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent; provided, however, that the company shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. the company further agrees that it will not, without purchaser indemnitee's prior written consent, settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof in any pending or threatened action, suit, claim or proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any purchaser indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such action, suit, claim or proceeding) unless such settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release of purchasers and each other purchaser indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action, suit, claim or proceeding. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 5.12 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to a purchaser indemnitee with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the company, in lieu of indemnifying such purchaser indemnitee hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such purchaser indemnitee as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of purchaser indemnitee on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company and of purchaser indemnitee shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or by purchaser indemnitee and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) notwithstanding the provisions of this section 5.12, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in any underwriting agreement contemplated in article vi and entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering thereunder are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. (f) the rights of purchaser under this section 5.12 shall be in addition to any liability that the company might otherwise have to purchaser, the purchaser representative and the observer under this agreement, at common law or otherwise. 5.13 further assurances. (a) at any time or from time to time after the note closing and each option closing and each exercise of the warrants, each party shall execute and deliver to the other party or parties such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other actions as either party may reasonably request more effectively to carry out the provisions of this agreement and the other transaction documents. 35 article vi registration rights section 6. registration rights. 6.1 definitions. for purposes of this article vi: (a) the term "holder" means the purchaser or any other person who shall subsequently own or have the right to acquire registrable securities or any assignee thereof in accordance with section 6.12 hereof. (b) the terms "register," "registered" and "registration" refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement or similar document in compliance with the securities act, and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement or document. (c) the term "registrable securities" means (i) the shares of common stock issued and sold by the company pursuant to this agreement (including all shares issued by the company upon conversion of the convertible secured note or exercise of the option or any of the warrants); (ii) any and all shares of the common stock issued or issuable upon exercise, conversion, or exchange of equity securities acquired by purchaser pursuant to section 5.1; (iii) the warrants; (vi) any and all shares of common stock issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants; (v) stock issued in lieu thereof in any reorganization, which has not been sold to the public; or (vi) stock issued in respect of the stock referred to in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or the like, which has not been sold to the public excluding in all cases, however, any of the foregoing sold by a holder pursuant to a registration statement under this agreement, a transaction pursuant to rule 144 promulgated under the securities act, or sold in any other transaction in which registration rights are not transferred pursuant to article vi hereof. (d) the number of shares of "registrable securities then outstanding" shall be determined by the number of shares of common stock outstanding which are, and the number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to then exercisable or convertible securities which are exercisable or convertible into, registrable securities. 6.2 request for registration. (a) if the company shall receive at any time after the one year anniversary date of the note closing date, a written request from one or more holders representing at least 25% of the registrable securities then outstanding, that the company file a registration statement under the securities act covering the registration with respect to all or a part of the registrable securities then outstanding, having an aggregate offering price, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of at least $3,000,000, the company shall, within fifteen 36 (15) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all holders of registrable securities identified to the company in accordance with section 6.12 and shall, subject to the limitations of section 6.2(d), file as soon as practicable, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days of the receipt of such request, a registration statement under the securities act covering all registrable securities which such holders request to be registered within twenty (20) days of the mailing of such notice by the company in accordance with section 8.7 of this agreement. any registration statement filed pursuant to under this section 6.2 may, subject to the provisions of section 6.2(b), include securities of the company other than registrable securities. (b) if the holders of registrable securities initiating the registration request pursuant to section 6.2(a) ("initiating holders") intend to distribute the registrable securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the company as a part of their request made pursuant to this section 6.2 and the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in section 6.2(a). in such event, the right of any such holder to include such holder's registrable securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's registrable securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and such holder) to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the company as provided in section 6.5(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority in interest of the initiating holders, which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the company. if the company, on its own behalf or on behalf of other holders of securities other than registrable securities, requests inclusion in such registration, the initiating holders, to the extent they deem advisable and consistent with the goals of such registration, shall, on behalf of all holders, offer to include such securities other than registrable securities in the underwriting (the "other securities") and may condition such offer on the acceptance by such persons of the terms of this section 6.2. in the event, however, that the number of shares so included exceeds the number of shares of registrable securities included by all holders, such registration shall be treated as governed section 6.3 hereof rather than section 6.2, and it shall not count as a registration for purposes of section 6.2 hereof. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 6.2, if the underwriter advises the initiating holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the other securities shall first be excluded from such registration to the extent required by such limitation. if a further limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten is still required, then the initiating holders shall so advise all holders of registrable securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all holders thereof, including the initiating holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of registrable securities owned by each holder. if any holder of registrable securities, or a holder of other securities entitled (upon request) to be included in such registration, disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company, the underwriter and the initiating holders delivered at least seven (7) days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. the securities so withdrawn shall also be withdrawn from the registration statement. 37 (c) the company is obligated to effect only two (2) registrations under this section 6.2 and shall not be obligated to effect any registrations under this section 6.2 within one hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of any registration statement pertaining to securities of the company. (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company shall furnish to the initiating holders a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its shareholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, the company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request of the initiating holders; provided, however, that the company may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve-month period. 6.3 company registration. (a) if (but without any obligation to do so) the company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the company for shareholders other than the holders, but excluding a registration relating to an aggregate of 409,200 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock issued pursuant to a private placement effected in december 1995 through march 1996) any of its common stock under the securities act in connection with a secondary offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a company stock option, stock purchase or similar plan, or a registration relating solely to a transaction of the type described in rule 145(a) under the securities act), the company shall, at such time, promptly give each holder written notice of such registration. upon the written request of any holder given within twenty (20) days after mailing of such notice by the company in accordance with section 8.7 of this agreement, the company shall, subject to the provisions of section 6.3(b), include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all of the registrable securities that each such holder has requested to be registered. (b) in connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares being issued by the company, the company shall not be required under section 6.3 to include any holder's securities in such underwriting unless such holder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the company and the underwriters selected by it, and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the underwriters, jeopardize the success of the offering by the company. if the total amount of securities, including registrable securities, requested by shareholders to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than by the company that the underwriters reasonably believe compatible with the success of the offering, then the company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including registrable securities, which the underwriters believe will not jeopardize the success of the offering so long as all securities of all other shareholders (including without limitation holders of registration rights) but the holders are excluded first. if any holder disapproves of the terms 38 of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company and the underwriter delivered at lease seven (7) days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. any registrable securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. the holders shall have no right to participate in the selection of the underwriters for an offering pursuant to section 6.3. (c) the company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this section 6.3 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any holder has elected to include securities in such registration. 6.4 form s-3. after the company has qualified for the use of form s-3, in addition to the rights contained in the foregoing provisions of this article vi, one or more holders shall have the right to request registrations on form s-3 (such requests shall be in writing and shall state the number of shares of registrable securities to be disposed of and the intended methods of disposition of such shares by purchaser), provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration: (a) if the holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell registrable securities and such other securities (if any) on form s-3 at an aggregate price to the public of less than $1,000,000; (b) in the event that the company shall furnish the certification described in section 6.2(d) (but subject to the limitations set forth therein); (c) in a given twelve-month period, after the company has effected two such registrations in any such period; or (d) within one hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of a company registration statement of the type described in section 6.3. 6.5 obligations of the company. whenever required under this agreement to effect the registration of any registrable securities, the company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for up to one hundred twenty (120) days; (b) prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such 39 jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the holders thereof, provided that (i) the company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in the event any jurisdiction in which the securities shall be qualified imposes a non-waiveable requirement that expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of the securities be borne by selling shareholders, such expenses shall be payable pro rata by selling shareholders; (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering. each holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement; (f) notify each holder participating in the registration covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; in the event of a pending material event or transaction not publicly disclosed by the company, then upon written notice of such event or transaction, each holder shall suspend any sales or trades of the company's securities under any registration statement for up to thirty (30) days immediately following such notice; (g) cause all such registrable securities registered pursuant to this agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or national market system on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed or traded; (h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all registrable securities registered pursuant to such registration statement and a cusip number for all such registrable securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration; (i) to the extent economically feasible, use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen (18) months, beginning with the first month after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act; and (j) furnish, at the request of any holder requesting registration of registrable securities pursuant to this agreement, on the date that such registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration pursuant to this agreement, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, or, if such securities are not being sold through underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the 40 company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the holders requesting registration of registrable securities and (ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the holders requesting registration of registrable securities. 6.6 provision of information. it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the company to take any action pursuant to this article vi that the selling holders shall furnish to the company such information regarding themselves, the registrable securities held by them, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of the registrable securities. 6.7 expenses of demand registration. all expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to section 6.2 and 6.4, including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the participating holders, shall be borne by the company; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to section 6.2 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered (in which case all participating holders shall bear such expenses); provided, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, such holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business or prospects of the company from that known to such holders at the time of their request, then the holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to section 6.2. 6.8 expenses of company registration. the company shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing or qualification of registrable securities with respect to the registrations pursuant to section 6.3 for each holder thereof (which right may be assigned as provided in section 6.12), including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees relating or apportionable thereto and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the participating holders selected by a majority in interest thereof, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities included in such registration. 6.9 delay of registration. no holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this agreement. 6.10 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this agreement: 41 (a) to the extent permitted by law, the company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of such registrable securities, the officers and directors of each such holder, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) for such holder and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the securities act or the exchange act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the securities act, the exchange act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the securities act, the exchange act or any state securities law; and the company will reimburse each such holder, officer or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section a shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor shall the company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such holder, officer, director, underwriter or controlling person. (b) to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, any underwriter and any other holder selling securities in such registration statement or any of its directors or officers or any person who controls such holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, or underwriter or controlling person, or other such holder or director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or controlling person, other holder, officer, director, or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section b shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement in effected without the consent of the holder from whom indemnification is sought (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); 42 provided, that, in no event shall any indemnity under this section b exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such holder. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 6.10 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 6.10, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 6.10, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 6.10. (d) the obligations of the company and holders under this section 6.10 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement, and otherwise. 6.11 reports under the exchange act. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 under the securities act and any other rule or regulation of the commission that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144, at all times;

stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of such shares or (iii) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of such shares, the total number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be adjusted so that upon the subsequent exercise of this warrant, the warrant holder shall be entitled to receive at the same aggregate exercise price the number of shares of capital stock and other securities (of one or more classes) which such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive immediately following the happening of any of the events described above had this warrant been exercised in full immediately prior to the record date with respect to such event. any adjustment made pursuant to this section shall, in the case of a dividend or distribution of stock or other securities, become effective as of the record date therefor and, in the case of a subdivision or combination, be made as of the effective date thereof. if, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section, the warrant holder shall become entitled to receive shares or other units of two or more classes of capital stock or other securities of the company upon a subsequent exercise hereof, the board of directors of the company (whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and, upon request by the warrant holder, shall be evidenced by a certified board resolution delivered to the warrant holder) shall determine the allocation of the adjusted exercise price between or among shares of such classes of capital stock. the above provisions of this section 8.1 shall apply similarly to successive stock dividends, subdivisions and combinations. 8.2. in the event of a capital reorganization or a reclassification of the common stock (except as provided in section 8.1 above or section 8.4 below), any warrant holder, upon exercise of this warrant, shall be entitled to receive, in substitution for the common stock to which it would have become entitled upon exercise immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification, the shares (of any class or classes) or other securities or property of the company (or cash) that it would have been entitled to receive at the same aggregate exercise price upon such reorganization or reclassification if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the 4 record date with respect to such event; and in any such case, appropriate provision (as determined by the board of directors of the company, whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and, upon request by the warrant holder, shall be evidenced by a certified board resolution delivered to the warrant holder) shall be made for the application of this section 8.2 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the warrant holder (including but not limited to the allocation of the exercise price between or among shares of classes of capital stock or other securities), to the end that this section 8.2 (including the adjustments of the number of shares of common stock or other securities purchasable and the exercise price thereof) shall thereafter be reflected, as nearly as reasonably practicable, in all subsequent exercises of this warrant for any shares or securities or other property (or cash) thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. the above provisions of this section 8.2 shall apply similarly to successive reorganizations or recapitalizations. 8.3. whenever the number of shares of common stock or other securities purchasable upon exercise of this warrant is adjusted as provided in this section 8, the company will promptly deliver to the warrant holder a certificate signed by a chairman or co-chairman of the board or the president or a vice president of the company and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the company setting forth the number and kind of securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of this warrant, as so adjusted, stating that such adjustments in the number or kind of shares or other securities or property conform to the requirements of this section 8, and setting forth a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustments; provided, however, that failure to deliver any notice required under this section 8.3, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustments under this section 8; and provided, further, that, where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as part of the notice required to be given pursuant to section 9 hereof. 8.4. in the event of any consolidation or share exchange reorganization of the company with, or merger of the company into, another corporation (other than a consolidation, share exchange information or merger which does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding common stock), or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the entity formed by such consolidation, share exchange reorganization or merger or the person which shall have acquired such property, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the warrant holder a new warrant providing that the warrant holder shall have the right thereafter (until the expiration of this warrant) to receive, upon exercise of such warrant, solely the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (or cash) receivable upon such consolidation, share exchange reorganization, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company for which this warrant might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, share exchange reorganization, merger, sale or transfer. such new warrant shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this section 8.4. the above provision of this section 8.4 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, share exchange reorganizations, mergers, sales or transfers. 8.5. irrespective of any adjustments in the number or kind of shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of this warrant, this warrant and any replacement or 5 balance warrants thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the original warrant. 8.6. the company may retain a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing, which may be the firm regularly retained by the company, selected by the board of directors of the company or the executive committee of said board, to make any computation required under this section 8, and a certificate signed by such firm shall, in the absence of fraud or gross negligence, be conclusive evidence of the correctness of any computation made under this section 8. 8.7. for the purpose of this section 8, the term "common stock" shall mean (i) the class of stock designated as common stock in the restated articles of incorporation of the company, as amended, at the date of this warrant, or (ii) any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such common stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. in the event that at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section 8, the warrant holder shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the company other than shares of common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in this section 8, and all other provisions of this warrant, with respect to the common stock, shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. 8.8. the company may, from time to time and to the extent permitted by law, reduce the exercise price of this warrant by any amount for a period of not less than twenty (20) days. if the company so reduces the exercise price of this warrant, it will give the warrant holder not less than fifteen (15) days' notice of such decrease, and shall take such other steps as may be required under applicable law in connection with any offers or sales of securities at the reduced price. 8.9. whenever the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant is adjusted as provided in section 8, the exercise price for each share payable upon exercise shall be adjusted by multiplying such exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. 9. notice of certain corporate actions. in case the company after the date hereof shall propose (i) to offer to the holders of common stock, generally, rights to subscribe to or purchase any additional shares of any class of its capital stock, any evidences of its indebtedness or assets, or any other rights or options or (ii) to effect any reclassification of common stock (other than a reclassification involving merely the subdivision or combination of outstanding shares of common stock) or any capital reorganization, or any consolidation or merger to which the company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the company is required, or any sale, transfer or other disposition of its property and assets substantially as an entirety, or the liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up of the company, then, in each 6 such case, the company shall deliver to the warrant holder notice of such proposed action, which notice shall specify the date on which the books of the company shall close or a record be taken for such offer of rights or options, or the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up shall take place or commence, as the case may be, and which shall also specify any record date for determination of holders of common stock entitled to vote thereon or participate therein and shall set forth such facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate any adjustments in the exercise price and the number or kind of shares or other securities purchasable upon exercise of the warrant which will be required as a result of such action. such notice shall be sent, in the case of any action covered by clause (i) above, at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the common stock for purposes of such action or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of shares of common stock of record are to be entitled to such offering; and, in the case of any action covered by clause (ii) above, at least twenty (20) days prior to the earlier of the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up is expected to become effective and the date on which it is expected that holders of shares of common stock of record on such date shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up. 10. taxes. the company shall pay all documentary, stamp or other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of shares of capital stock or other securities of the company upon the exercise hereof. 11. no fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue any replacement or balance warrant evidencing a fraction of a warrant or to issue fractions of shares or other securities upon the exercise or conversion of this warrant. if any fraction (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth) of a warrant or of a share or other securities would, except for the provisions of this section 11, be issuable upon the exercise or conversion of any warrant, the company shall, at its option, either purchase such fraction for an amount in cash equal to the current value of such fraction computed on the basis of the fair market value thereof, or issue the required fractional warrant, or share or other security. the warrant holder expressly waives any right to receive a replacement or balance warrant evidencing any fraction of a warrant or to receive any fractional share or other securities upon exercise or conversion of this warrant, except as expressly provided in this section 11. each adjustment in the number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder shall be calculated to the nearest whole share with fractional shares disregarded. 12. no stockholder rights. this warrant, as such, shall not entitle the warrant holder to vote, receive dividends or be deemed the holder of common stock or any other securities of the company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of this warrant for any purpose whatever, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the warrant holder any of the rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization, issuance of stock, 7 reclassification of stock, change of par value or change of stock to no par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in section 9 hereof), or to receive dividend or subscription rights, or otherwise, until this warrant shall have been exercised or converted in accordance with the provisions hereof. 13. transfer and exchange of warrant. subject to section 11, this warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the warrant holder at the principal office of the company, for new warrants of like tenor representing in the aggregate the rights to subscribe for and purchase the number of shares which may be subscribed for and purchased hereunder, each of such new warrants to represent the right to subscribe for and purchase such number of shares as shall be designated by the warrant holder at the time of such surrender. subject, if applicable, to the restrictions provided in section 5.10 of the purchase agreement, this warrant and all rights hereunder may be transferred, in whole or in part, on the books of the company maintained for such purpose at the principal office of the company, by the warrant holder hereof in person, or by duly authorized

company will issue and deliver to the warrant holder a new warrant with respect to the warrant balance not so transferred. each taker and holder of this warrant or any warrant issued upon transfer hereof, by taking or holding the same, consents and agrees to be bound by the terms, conditions, representations and warranties hereof (and as a condition to any transfer of this warrant the transferee shall upon request by the company execute an agreement confirming the same), and, when this warrant shall have been so endorsed and presented, the person in possession of this warrant may be treated by the company, and all other persons dealing with this warrant, as the absolute owner hereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented hereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however that until a transfer of this warrant is duly registered on the books of the company, the company may treat the warrant holder hereof as the owner of this warrant for all purposes. 14. lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed warrant. if this warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the company may, on such customary and reasonable terms as to indemnity or otherwise as it may in its discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new warrant of like denomination and tenor as the warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed. 15. restrictions on transfer. 15.1. certificates. certificates representing any of the shares acquired pursuant to the provisions of this

("supergen") from supergen pursuant to the exercise of certain warrants to purchase stock held by the purchaser. the stock will be issued to purchaser in a transaction not involving a public offering and pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 act") and applicable state securities laws. in connection with such purchase and in order to comply with the exemptions from registration relied upon by supergen, purchaser represents, warrants and agrees as follows: the purchaser is an accredited investor within the meaning of rule 501 under the 1933 act and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the purchase of the stock and of protecting purchaser's interests in connection therewith. purchaser is acquiring the stock for its own account, to hold for investment, and purchaser shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the stock in violation of the 1933 act or the general rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") or in violation of any applicable state securities law. purchaser has been advised that the stock has not been registered under the 1933 act or state securities laws on the ground that this transaction is exempt from registration, and that reliance by supergen on such exemptions is predicated in part on purchaser's representations set forth in this letter. purchaser has been informed that under the 1933 act, the stock must be held indefinitely unless it is subsequently registered under the 1933 act or unless an exemption from such registration (such as rule 144) is available with respect to any proposed transfer or disposition by purchaser of the stock. purchaser further agrees that supergen may refuse to permit purchaser to sell, transfer or dispose of the common stock (except as permitted under rule 144) unless there is in effect a 13 registration statement under the 1933 act and any applicable state securities laws covering such transfer, or unless purchaser furnishes an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to counsel for supergen, to the effect that such registration is not required. purchaser also understands and agrees that there will be placed on the certificate(s) for the stock, or any substitutions therefor, applicable legends stating in substance: "the securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may not be sold, transferred, assigned or hypothecated unless there is an effective registration statement under such act covering such securities, the sale is made in accordance with rule 144 under the act, or the company receives an opinion of counsel for the holder of these securities reasonably satisfactory to the company, stating that such sale, transfer, assignment or hypothecation is exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of such act." if such shares are to be issued to tako ventures, llc or its affiliates: "the securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to restrictions on transfer, including rights of first refusal set forth in a convertible secured note, option and warrant purchase agreement dated as of june 17, 1997 by and among supergen, inc., tako ventures, llc and, solely for purposes of sections 5.3 and 5.5 thereof lawrence j. ellison, a copy of which agreement may be obtained at no cost by written request made by the holder of record of this certificate to the secretary of supergen, inc. at supergen, inc.'s principal executive offices." purchaser has carefully read this letter and has discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon purchaser's resale of the stock with purchaser's counsel. very truly yours, purchaser by: _________________________________ title: ______________________________ 14 ex-4 5 exhibit 4 the security

warrant holder. the warrant holder shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares at the close of business on the date on which this warrant was surrendered together with a notice of exercise or conversion and, in the case of exercise, payment of the exercise price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate or certificates, except that, if the date of such surrender, notice and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the company are closed, the warrant holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open. 6. covenants as to common stock. the company covenants and agrees that all the shares will,

any additional shares of any class of its capital stock, any evidence of its indebtedness or assets, or any other rights or options) on its outstanding common stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of such shares or (iii) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of such shares, the total number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be adjusted so that upon the subsequent exercise of this warrant, the warrant holder shall be entitled to receive at the same aggregate exercise price the number of shares of capital stock and other securities (of one or more classes) which such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive immediately following the happening of any of the events described above had this warrant been exercised in full immediately prior to the record date with respect to such event. any adjustment made pursuant to this section shall, in the case of a dividend or distribution of stock or other securities, become effective as of the record date therefor and, in the case of a subdivision or combination, be made as of the effective date thereof. if, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section, the warrant holder shall become entitled to receive shares or other units of two or more classes of capital stock or other securities of the company upon a subsequent exercise hereof, the board of directors of the company (whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and, upon request by the warrant holder, shall be evidenced by a certified board resolution delivered to the warrant holder) shall determine the allocation of the adjusted exercise price between or among shares of such classes of capital stock. the above provisions of this section 8.1 shall apply similarly to successive stock dividends, subdivisions and combinations. 8.2 in the event of a capital reorganization or a reclassification of the common stock (except as provided in section 8.1 above or section 8.4 below), any warrant holder, upon exercise of this warrant, shall be entitled to receive, in substitution for the common stock to which it would have become entitled upon exercise immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification, the shares (of any class or classes) or other securities or property of the company (or cash) that it would have been entitled to receive at the same aggregate exercise price upon such reorganization or reclassification if this warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the record date with respect to such event; and in any such case, appropriate provision (as determined by the board of directors of the company, whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and, upon request by the warrant holder, shall be evidenced by a certified board resolution delivered to the warrant holder) shall be made for the application of this section 8.2 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the warrant holder (including but not limited to the allocation of the exercise price between or among shares of classes of capital stock or other securities), to the end that this section 8.2 (including the adjustments of the number of shares of common stock or other securities purchasable and the exercise price thereof) shall thereafter be reflected, as nearly as reasonably practicable, in all subsequent exercises of this warrant for any shares or securities or other property (or cash) thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. the above provisions of this section 8.2 shall apply similarly to successive reorganizations or recapitalizations. 8.3 whenever the number of shares of common stock or other securities purchasable upon exercise of this warrant is adjusted as provided in this section 8, the company will promptly deliver to the warrant holder a certificate signed by a chairman or co-chairman of the board or the president or a vice president of the company and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the company setting forth the number and kind of securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of this warrant, as so adjusted, stating that such adjustments in the number or kind of shares or other securities or property conform to the requirements of this section 8, and setting forth a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustments; provided, however, that failure to deliver any notice required under this section 8.3, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustments under this section 8; and provided, further, that, where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as part of the notice required to be given pursuant to section 9 hereof. 8.4 in the event of any consolidation or share exchange reorganization of the company with, or merger of the company into, another corporation (other than a consolidation, share exchange reorganization or merger which does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding common stock), or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the entity formed by such consolidation, share exchange reorganization or merger or the person which shall have acquired such property, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the warrant holder a new warrant providing that the warrant holder shall have the right thereafter (until the expiration of this warrant) to receive, upon exercise of such warrant, solely the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (or cash) receivable upon such consolidation, share exchange reorganization, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company for which this warrant might have been exercised immediately prior to such consolidation, share exchange reorganization, merger, sale or transfer. such new warrant shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this section 8.4. the above provision of this section 8.4 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, share exchange reorganizations, mergers, sales or transfers. 8.5 irrespective of any adjustments in the number or kind of shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of this warrant, this warrant and any replacement or balance warrants thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the original warrant. 8.6 the company may retain a firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing, which may be the firm regularly retained by the company, selected by the board of directors of the company or the executive committee of said board, to make any computation required under this section 8, and a certificate signed by such firm shall, in the absence of fraud or gross negligence, be conclusive evidence of the correctness of any computation made under this section 8. 8.7 for the purpose of this section 8, the term "common stock" shall mean (i) the class of stock designated as common stock in the restated articles of incorporation of the company, as amended, at the date of this warrant, or (ii) any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such common stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. in the event that at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this section 8, the warrant holder shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the company other than shares of common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in this section 8, and all other provisions of this warrant, with respect to the common stock, shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. 8.8 the company may, from time to time and to the extent permitted by law, reduce the exercise price of this warrant by any amount for a period of not less than twenty (20) days. if the company so reduces the exercise price of this warrant, it will give the warrant holder not less than fifteen (15) days' notice of such decrease, and shall take such other steps as may be required under applicable law in connection with any offers or sales of securities at the reduced price. 8.9 whenever the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant is adjusted as provided in section 8, the exercise price for each share payable upon exercise shall be adjusted by multiplying such exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. 9. notice of certain corporate actions. in case the company after the date hereof shall propose (i) to offer to the holders of common stock, generally, rights to subscribe to or purchase any additional shares of any class of its capital stock, any evidences of its indebtedness or assets, or any other rights or options or (ii) to effect any reclassification of common stock (other than a reclassification involving merely the subdivision or combination of outstanding shares of common stock) or any capital reorganization, or any consolidation or merger to which the company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the company is required, or any sale, transfer or other disposition of its property and assets substantially as an entirety, or the liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up of the company, then, in each such case, the company shall deliver to the warrant holder notice of such proposed action, which notice shall specify the date on which the books of the company shall close or a record be taken for such offer of rights or options, or the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up shall take place or commence, as the case may be, and which shall also specify any record date for determination of holders of common stock entitled to vote thereon or participate therein and shall set forth such facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate any adjustments in the exercise price and the number or kind of shares or other securities purchasable upon exercise of the warrant which will be required as a result of such action. such notice shall be sent, in the case of any action covered by clause (i) above, at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the common stock for purposes of such action or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of shares of common stock of record are to be entitled to such offering; and, in the case of any action covered by clause (ii) above, at least twenty (20) days prior to the earlier of the date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up is expected to become effective and the date on which it is expected that holders of shares of common stock of record on such date shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, other disposition, liquidation, voluntary or involuntary dissolution or winding-up. 10. taxes. the company shall pay all documentary, stamp or other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of shares of capital stock or other securities of the company upon the exercise hereof. 11. no fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue any replacement or balance warrant evidencing a fraction of a warrant or to issue fractions of shares or other securities upon the exercise or conversion of this warrant. if any fraction (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth) of a warrant or of a share or other securities would, except for the provisions of this section 11, be issuable upon the exercise or conversion of any warrant, the company shall, at its option, either purchase such fraction for an amount in cash equal to the current value of such fraction computed on the basis of the fair market value thereof, or issue the required fractional warrant, or share or other security. the warrant holder expressly waives any right to receive a replacement or balance warrant evidencing any fraction of a warrant or to receive any fractional share or other securities upon exercise or conversion of this warrant, except as expressly provided in this section 11. each adjustment in the number of shares of common stock purchasable hereunder shall be calculated to the nearest whole share with fractional shares disregarded. 12. no stockholder rights. this warrant, as such, shall not entitle the warrant holder to vote, receive dividends or be deemed the holder of common stock or any other securities of the company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of this warrant for any purpose whatever, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the warrant holder any of the rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization, issuance of stock, reclassification of stock, change of par value or change of stock to no par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in section 9 hereof), or to receive dividend or subscription rights, or otherwise, until this warrant shall have been exercised or converted in accordance with the provisions hereof. 13. transfer and exchange of warrant. subject to section 11, this warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender

holder a new warrant with respect to the warrant balance not so transferred. each taker and holder of this warrant or any warrant issued upon transfer hereof, by taking or holding the same, consents and agrees to be bound by the terms, conditions, representations and warranties hereof (and as a condition to any transfer of this warrant the transferee shall upon request by the company execute an agreement confirming the same), and, when this warrant shall have been so endorsed and presented, the person in possession of this warrant may be treated by the company, and all other persons dealing with this warrant, as the absolute owner hereof for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented hereby, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however that until a transfer of this warrant is duly registered on the books of the company, the company may treat the warrant holder hereof as the owner of this warrant for all purposes. 14. lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed warrant. if this warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the company may, on such customary and reasonable terms as to indemnity or otherwise as it may in its discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new warrant of like denomination and tenor as the warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or
