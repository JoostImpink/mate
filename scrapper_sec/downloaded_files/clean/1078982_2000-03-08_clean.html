settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the indemnified party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such claim

party) have the right to undertake, at the indemnifying party's cost and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying party. in the event the indemnified party assumes the defense of the claim, the indemnified party will keep the indemnifying party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected pursuant to and in 23 accordance with this section 9.4 and for any final judgment (subject to any right
