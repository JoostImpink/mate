the support agreements (as defined in item&#160;4 below) were entered into among stefanini, platinum and the following stockholders of techteam: (i)&#160;costa brava partnership iii l.p. and (ii)&#160;emancipation capital, llc (collectively, the &#8220;stockholders&#8221;). the stockholders entered into the support agreements as an inducement to stefanini and platinum to enter into the merger agreement (as defined in item&#160;4 below). the support agreement shares (as defined below) to which this statement relates, have not been purchased by the reporting persons. the reporting persons have not paid additional consideration to the stockholders in connection with the execution and delivery of the support agreements and thus no funds were used for such purpose. for a description of the support agreements, see item&#160;4 below, which description is incorporated herein by reference in response to this item&#160;3. &#160; in connection with the offer (as defined in item&#160;4 below), platinum estimates that it will need approximately $93.4 million to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to the offer (assuming that all such shares of common stock are validly tendered and not withdrawn). platinum will have sufficient cash on hand at the expiration of the offer to pay for all outstanding shares of common stock that are validly tendered and accepted for payment in the offer, because stefanini will contribute or cause to be contributed all funds needed for the offer and the merger.&#160;&#160;stefanini has obtained an irrevocable commitment from mr. stefanini and his wife, ms. sajovic, the sole directors and shareholders of stefanini, to subscribe for up to $95 million of the equity of stefanini, conditioned only on the closing of the offer, and certain affiliates of stefanini have guaranteed platinum&#8217;s and stefanini&#8217;s obligations&#160;and liabilities pursuant to the merger agreement, including the obligations of platinum&#160;to pay for the shares of techteam common stock pursuant to the offer and the merger agreement. &#160; &#160; item 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;purpose of transaction &#160; (a)&#8212;(b) on november 1, 2010, stefanini, platinum and techteam entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221;), that contemplates the acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock. the merger agreement provides that platinum will commence a cash tender offer (the &#8220;offer&#8221;) to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock at a price of $8.35 per share (such price, or any other price per share that is paid in the offer, referred to as the &#8220;offer price&#8221;), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon and less any required withholding tax. &#160; pursuant to the merger agreement, platinum will commence the offer promptly after the date of the merger agreement. the obligation of platinum to accept for payment any shares of common stock in the offer is subject to customary conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including that: (i)&#160;at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding (determined on a fully-diluted basis as set forth in the merger agreement) shall have been validly tendered (and not withdrawn); and (ii)&#160;the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied, including that the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, has expired. &#160; the merger agreement also provides that, after completion of the offer, platinum will be merged with and into techteam, with techteam surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of stefanini (the &#8220;merger&#8221;). upon completion of the merger, all remaining outstanding shares of common stock not tendered in the offer (other than shares that are: (i)&#160;owned by stefanini, platinum or any wholly-owned subsidiary of stefanini; (ii)&#160;held in the treasury of techteam or owned by techteam or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries; or (iii)&#160;held by stockholders of techteam, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under the general corporation law of the state of delaware (the &#8220;dgcl&#8221;)) will be acquired for cash at the offer price (without interest thereon and less any required withholding tax) on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement &#160; as an inducement to stefanini and platinum to enter into the merger agreement, the stockholders have each entered into a tender and support agreement (collectively, the &#8220;support agreements&#8221;) with stefanini and platinum pursuant to which they have agreed, in their capacity as stockholders of techteam, among other things, to tender or cause to be tendered to platinum in the offer all of the shares of common stock owned beneficially and/or of record by them, as well as any additional shares of common stock which they may acquire or own, beneficially or of record (pursuant to techteam stock options or otherwise) (the &#8220;support agreement shares&#8221;). the stockholders also have agreed to vote, or cause to be voted, all of their support agreement shares, among other things, in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement (and against any action, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent, delay or adversely effect in any material way the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), to the extent any such shares have not been previously accepted for payment pursuant to the offer, and have given stefanini an irrevocable proxy to vote each such stockholder&#8217;s shares to that effect. in addition, the stockholders have agreed to waive any appraisal rights they may have under the&#160;dgcl and have agreed not to take any action that techteam is prohibited from taking under the merger agreement with respect to the non-solicitation of alternative &#8220;acquisition proposals&#8221; as defined in the merger agreement. by their terms, the support agreements terminate upon the earliest to occur of the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, the effective time of the merger, or the mutual written consent of the parties to the support agreement.&#160;&#160;additionally, each stockholder has the right to terminate the applicable support agreement upon any decrease in the offer price or any change in the form of consideration payable in the offer, any decrease in the number of shares sought pursuant to the offer, any amendment or waiver by stefanini or platinum of the requirement that at least a majority of the then outstanding shares be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer, the addition of any new conditions to the offer not set forth on annex i to the merger agreement, modify the conditions set forth on annex i in a manner adverse to the stockholders, or make any other change in the terms or conditions of the offer that is materially adverse to the stockholders. as of november 1, 2010, the stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of 2,056,309 shares of common stock. &#160; &#160; the foregoing descriptions of the merger agreement and the support agreements in this statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements included as exhibits&#160;2 and&#160;3 hereto, which are incorporated by reference in this item&#160;4. &#160; (c) not applicable. &#160; (d) the merger agreement provides that, promptly upon the purchase by platinum pursuant to the offer of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, stefanini will be entitled to designate to serve on techteam&#8217;s board of directors a number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, proportionate to platinum&#8217;s ownership of common stock (but in no event, except as described in the following sentence,&#160;constituting less than a majority of the entire techteam board of directors). pursuant to the merger agreement, techteam will, if requested by stefanini, promptly increase the size of techteam&#8217;s board of directors or use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to provide stefanini with the level of board representation to which it is entitled under the merger agreement, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause stefanini&#8217;s designees to be elected or appointed to techteam&#8217;s board of directors. the merger agreement also provides that, following the election or appointment of stefanini&#8217;s designees to techteam&#8217;s board of directors and prior to the effective time of the merger, any amendment or termination of the merger agreement requiring action by techteam&#8217;s board of directors, any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of stefanini or platinum under the merger agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions under the merger agreement that are for the benefit of techteam, and any action to seek to enforce any obligation of stefanini or platinum under the merger agreement (or any other action by techteam&#8217;s board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, the offer or the merger if such other action adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, in each case in any material respect, any of the holders of shares of common stock other than stefanini or platinum), may only be authorized by a majority of the directors of techteam then in office who were directors of techteam on the date of the merger agreement or their successors as appointed by such continuing directors. &#160; (e) under the terms of the merger agreement, techteam may not, without stefanini&#8217;s prior written consent, among other things: (i)&#160;issue, sell, pledge, encumber or dispose of any shares of any class of its capital stock; (ii)&#160;redeem, repurchase or acquire any shares of its capital stock; (iii)&#160;declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution with respect to any of its capital stock; or (iv)&#160;split, divide, subdivide, combine, consolidate or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize the issuance of any securities in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock; in each case, except under limited circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement. &#160; (f) if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, techteam, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of stefanini. &#160; (g) the merger agreement contains provisions that limit the ability of techteam to engage in a transaction that would entail a change of control of techteam (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated. &#160; (h) pursuant to the merger agreement, if the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, stefanini will apply for delisting of the common stock from the nasdaq global stock market promptly after the consummation of the merger. &#160; (i) upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the common stock will become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section&#160;12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. &#160;
