to the provisions of section 2.3 hereof, at the effective time, all of the shares of common stock, no par value, of calogic ("calogic common stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to -------------------- the effective time (excluding any calogic common stock held by parent or merger sub or any other subsidiary of parent, or by calogic or any subsidiary of calogic, which shares ("excluded shares") will be automatically canceled in the --------------- merger without payment of any consideration therefor, and excluding dissenting shares (as defined in section 2.3 hereof)), will automatically, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of parent ("parent common ------------- stock") in accordance with section 2.1(c), and cash (rounded down to the nearest - ----- whole cent) in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to section 2.6 below. shares of calogic common stock that are -2- actually issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, excluding the excluded shares, are sometimes referred to herein as the "outstanding calogic shares." all rights, warrants or options to acquire calogic -------------------------- common stock and securities convertible into calogic common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and do not expire pursuant to their terms on or before the closing (each of which is specifically identified in section 3.2 of the calogic disclosure schedule (as defined below)) are sometimes referred to herein as the "outstanding calogic options." --------------------------- (b) the maximum number of shares of parent common stock to be issued in exchange for the acquisition of all outstanding calogic shares and the assumption of all outstanding calogic options will be 3,400,000, provided such maximum number shall be adjusted, as appropriate, for any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or similar event. such shares are herein referred to as the "parent merger shares". -------------------- (c) the ratio at which one outstanding calogic share will be converted into shares of parent common stock at the effective time is herein called the "conversion ratio" and will be calculated as set forth in this ----------------- section 2.1(c). subject to section 2.3, at the effective time, each outstanding calogic share will be converted into the right to receive that number (which may be a fraction) of shares of parent common stock that equals the quotient obtained by dividing the number of parent merger shares by the sum of the number -------- of outstanding calogic shares plus the number of shares of calogic common stock ---- issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding calogic options. each holder of outstanding calogic shares will be entitled to receive that aggregate number of shares of parent common stock equal to the conversion ratio multiplied by the number of outstanding calogic shares held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time, subject to section 2.3 herein. (d) at the effective time, each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of merger sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder hereof, be converted into one share of common stock, no par value, of the surviving corporation. 2.2 escrow shares. ten percent of the parent merger shares (the "escrow ------------- ------ shares") will be deposited and held in escrow in accordance with an escrow - ------ agreement substantially in the form attached as exhibit 2.2 (the "escrow ----------- ------ agreement") as the first source, but not the sole source, of indemnification - --------- payments that may become due to parent pursuant to article x. the escrow shares will be withheld on a pro rata basis among the holders of the outstanding calogic shares. the exact number of escrow shares held for the account of each calogic stockholder will be determined at the closing by the agreement in writing of parent and calogic. the delivery of the escrow shares will be made on behalf of the holders of the outstanding calogic shares in accordance with the provisions hereof, with the same force and effect as if such shares had been delivered by parent directly to such holders and subsequently delivered by such holders to the escrow agent. the adoption of this agreement by stockholders of calogic will also constitute their approval of the terms and provisions of the escrow agreement, which is an integral term of the merger. 2.3 dissenting shares. any holder of shares of calogic common stock ----------------- that are outstanding on the record date for the determination of which holders will be entitled to vote for or against the merger who did not vote such shares in favor of the merger or sign and deliver a written consent thereto with respect to such shares (the shares of calogic common stock then outstanding that are not -3- thus voted or as to which such consents are not signed and delivered are referred to as "dissenting shares") will be entitled to exercise dissenters' ----------------- rights pursuant to chapter 13 of the cgcl with respect to such dissenting shares provided that such holder meets all of the requirements of the cgcl with respect to such dissenting shares, and will not be entitled to receive parent merger shares, unless otherwise provided by the cgcl or agreed in writing by parent. calogic will, after consultation with parent, give such notices with respect to dissenters' rights as may be required by the cgcl as soon as practicable. 2.4 delivery of evidence of ownership. at the closing, each holder of a --------------------------------- certificate or other documentation representing outstanding calogic shares, other than dissenting shares, will surrender such certificates or other documentation to parent, and, if not previously delivered, duly executed counterparts of this agreement, the escrow agreement, the investment agreement (as defined below) and the registration rights agreement (as defined below) and such other duly executed documentation as may be reasonably required by parent to effect a transfer of such shares, and upon such surrender and at the effective time each such holder will be entitled to receive promptly after the effective time from parent or its transfer agent certificates registered in the name of such holder representing the applicable number of parent merger shares, and the cash (calculated pursuant to section 2.6, which will be paid by check), to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this agreement, with a portion of such shares to be deposited in escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement, as provided in section 2.2. 2.5 no further ownership rights in calogic common stock. the merger and --------------------------------------------------- its approval by the stockholders of calogic and the execution of this agreement will be deemed, at the effective time, to constitute full satisfaction and termination of all rights and agreements pertaining to calogic common stock pursuant to the cgcl, by contract or otherwise. after the effective

provided, however, that the limitation on the obligations of any person for indemnifiable amounts arising out of criminal activity or fraud or willful misstatements or omissions by calogic or such person will be a dollar amount equal to the aggregate number of parent merger shares received by such person valued at the parent average closing price. parent will first seek reimbursement of any indemnifiable amounts pursuant to the provisions of the escrow agreement, but may seek indemnification hereunder with respect to any indemnifiable amounts after the termination of the escrow agreement, subject to section 10.6. during the term of the escrow agreement, parent's sole remedy will be a claim pursuant to the escrow agreement. to the extent parent is paid an amount on account of an indemnifiable matter in excess of the limitation set forth above, parent will promptly remit such excess amount to the party entitled thereto. 10.5 binding effect. the indemnification obligations contained in this -------------- article x are an integral part of this agreement and the merger in the absence of which parent would not have entered into this agreement. 10.6 time limit. the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements ---------- of calogic and the stockholders set forth in this agreement will survive the closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this agreement, but, absent fraud, any claims with respect thereto may be made only on or before the first yearly anniversary of the date of this agreement;

---------------------- exhibit 8.1 investment agreement this investment agreement is between sipex corporation, a massachusetts corporation ("sipex"), and you as the undersigned stockholder (the ----- "stockholder") of calogic, a california corporation ("calogic"). ----------- ------- a. sipex, cat acquisition corporation i, a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of sipex ("merger sub"), calogic and certain stockholders of ---------- calogic have entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of october __, 1999 (the "reorganization agreement"). ------------------------ b. the reorganization agreement provides for the merger of merger sub into calogic (the "merger"). upon the consummation of the merger, the undersigned ------ stockholder will become the owner of shares of common stock of sipex (the "sipex ----- common stock"). - ------------ c. all capitalized terms shall have the same meaning as defined in the reorganization agreement unless otherwise indicated herein. intending to be legally bound, and in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, sipex and you, as the stockholder, hereby agree as follows: 1. securities act matters. you acknowledge and agree that the sipex common ---------------------- stock to be issued to you has not been (and at the time of acquisition by you, will not have been) registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or any similar federal statute, and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission thereunder (collectively, the "securities act") or under the -------------- securities laws of any state, in reliance upon certain exemptive provisions of such statutes, and have not been registered under or qualified under the securities or other laws of any other jurisdiction. you recognize and acknowledge that such claims of exemption are based, in part, upon your representations contained in this agreement. you further recognize and acknowledge that, because the sipex common stock is not registered under federal and state laws, it is not presently eligible for public resale, and may only be resold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act and any applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to a valid exemption from such registration requirements. you recognize and acknowledge that rule 144 promulgated under the securities act (which facilitates routine sales of securities in accordance with the terms and conditions of that rule, including a holding period requirement) is not now available to you for resale of the sipex common stock, and you recognize and acknowledge that, in the absence of the availability of rule 144, a sale pursuant to a claim of exemption from registration under the securities act would require compliance with some other exemption under the securities act, none of which may be available for resale or other disposition of the sipex common stock by you. you recognize and acknowledge that, except as set forth in a registration rights agreement being executed in connection with this agreement, sipex is under no obligation to register the sipex common stock, either pursuant to the securities act or the securities laws of any state or to supply the information which may be necessary to enable you to sell the sipex common stock. you agree that sipex, at its discretion, may cause stop transfer orders to be placed -2- with its transfer agent with respect to the certificates representing your shares of sipex common stock, and may place legends on such certificates reflecting any applicable restrictions on transfer. 2. restrictive legend. each certificate representing sipex common stock ------------------ shall, except as otherwise provided in this section 2 or in section 3, be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following form: "this security has not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), or any state securities laws and may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of unless: (i) there is an effective registration statement under the act and applicable state securities laws covering any such transaction; (ii) the corporation receives an opinion of legal counsel satisfactory to the corporation that such transaction is exempt from such registration or (iii) the corporation is otherwise satisfied that such transaction is exempt from such registration. the holder of this security is entitled to certain registration rights and subject to certain restrictions on sale, pledge or disposition of this security as set forth in a registration rights agreement and an investment agreement dated as of october __, 1999, copies of which may be obtained from the clerk of the corporation." such certificates shall not bear such legend if in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to sipex the securities being sold thereby may be publicly sold without registration under the securities act and applicable state securities laws or if such securities have been sold pursuant to rule 144 or an effective registration statement. 3. notice of proposed transfer. prior to any proposed transfer of any sipex --------------------------- common stock other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, the holder thereof shall give written notice to sipex of its intention to effect such transfer. each such notice shall describe the manner of the proposed transfer and, if requested by sipex, shall be accompanied by an opinion of counsel satisfactory to sipex to the effect that the proposed transfer may be effected without registration under the securities act and applicable state securities laws, whereupon, if such proposed transfer is otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof and any "affiliate letter" executed by such holder, the holder of such security shall be entitled to transfer such security in accordance with the terms of its notice. if requested by sipex, a transferee of sipex common stock (other than sipex common stock sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act or pursuant to rule 144) will execute, as a condition of such transfer, an agreement to be bound by this agreement in a form acceptable to sipex and provide such other information and representations as sipex may reasonably request. each certificate for sipex common stock transferred as above provided shall bear the legend set forth in section 2, except that such certificate shall not bear such legend if (i) such transfer is in accordance with the provisions of rule 144 or (ii) the opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that the transferee and any subsequent transferee (other than an affiliate of sipex) would be entitled to transfer such securities in a public sale without registration under the securities act and applicable state securities laws. the restrictions provided for in this section 3 shall not apply to securities which are not required to bear the legend prescribed by section 2 in accordance with the provisions of that section. 4. representations and covenants. you hereby represent and warrant to ----------------------------- sipex as follows: (a) you understand that your investment in the sipex common stock involves risk. (b) you have consulted your own attorney, accountant or investment advisor with respect to the investment contemplated hereby and its suitability for you. any specific acknowledgment set forth below with respect to any statement or information furnished to you shall not be deemed to limit the generality of this representation and warranty.

make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such restricted stock, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to

federal and state securities laws. parent and holders of a majority of the shares then constituting restricted stock may determine, either before or after the initial filing of the registration statement pursuant to section 2, that the shares of restricted stock may only be sold pursuant to such registration in an underwritten public offering. in that event, parent will give prompt notice of such decision to each seller, and afford each seller an opportunity to participate in such underwritten offering. parent may set time limits for the sellers to indicate whether or not they desire to participate in such public offering, and may require those sellers wishing to participate therein to execute custody agreements and powers of attorney (which shall include authority to the attorney-in-fact thereunder to execute an underwriting agreement with respect to such offering) and other documentation in the form reasonably prescribed by parent and reasonably acceptable to the holders. upon the filing of a registration statement for such underwritten offering (or an amendment to a previously filed registration statement), sellers may only sell restricted stock pursuant to such underwritten offering (or pursuant to an available exemption from registration). if such underwritten offering is not completed within 75 days from the date of the determination referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, then such restriction shall no longer be applicable, and parent's obligations under section 2 hereof shall be reinstated, with a new registration statement (or

upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement under which such restricted stock was registered under the securities act pursuant to section 2 hereof at the time it became effective under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, offering circular,

which such restricted stock was registered under the securities act pursuant to section 2 hereof or any prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement or

(c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party other than under this section 5 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under this section 5 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such omission. in case any such claim or action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this section 5 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected, provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. each indemnified party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question as an indemnifying party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom. (d) in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability in any case in which a claim for indemnification is made pursuant to this section 5 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section 5 provides for indemnification in such case, parent and each seller of restricted stock will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in proportion to the relative fault of parent, on the one hand, and each holder, severally, on the other hand; provided, however, that, in any such case, no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or -6- entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation and; provided, further, that in no event shall any contribution under this subsection 5(d) on the part of any holder exceed the gross proceeds received by such holder from the sale of restricted stock. (e) the indemnities provided in this section 5 shall survive the transfer of any restricted stock by such holder. 6. reports under securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to --------------------------------------------- making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the securities act, parent agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 or any successor provision thereof, at all times; (b) maintain registration of its common stock under section 12 of the exchange act, as is necessary to enable holders to utilize form s-3 for the sale of their restricted stock; (c) file in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of parent under the securities act and the exchange act; and (d) furnish to any holder, so long as the holder owns any restricted stock, forthwith upon request: (i) a written statement by parent regarding its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144, the securities act and the exchange act (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of parent and such other reports and documents so filed by parent under the exchange act. 7. changes in common stock. if, and as often as, there is any change in ----------------------- the common stock by way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification or similar event, or through a reorganization or recapitalization or similar event, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and privileges granted hereby shall continue with respect to the common stock as so changed. 8. sellers' conduct. with respect to any sale of restricted stock ---------------- pursuant to section 2, you understand and agree as follows: (a) you will carefully review the information concerning you contained in the registration statement (if any) and will promptly notify parent if such information is not complete and accurate in all respects, including having properly disclosed any position, office or other material relationship within the past three years with parent or its affiliates; (b) you agree to sell your restricted stock only in the manner set forth in the registration statement while such registration statement is effective; (c) you agree to comply with the anti-manipulation rules under the exchange act in connection with purchases and sales of securities of parent during the time the registration statement remains effective; (d) you agree to only sell shares in a jurisdiction after counsel for parent has -7- advised that such sale is permissible under the applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws; (e) you agree to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act; (f) you agree to promptly notify parent of any and all planned sales and immediately notify parent of any completed sales of shares; and (g) you agree to suspend sales during the periods when sales are to be suspended pursuant to section 3(a) herein. 9. miscellaneous. ------------- (a) all covenants and agreements contained in this agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto (including, without limitation, transferees of any restricted stock, provided that such transferee executes a counterpart signature page to this agreement in a form acceptable to parent), whether so expressed or not, and provided, further, that no holder or transferee of merger shares which have ceased to be restricted stock shall have the benefit of the covenants and agreements in this agreement with respect to such merger shares.

exercise of an option. the stockholder hereby agrees with calogic, parent and merger sub that, without the prior written consent of parent (it being understood that parent will not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent), the stockholder will not sell, exchange, transfer, dispose of or otherwise reduce his or her risk relative to any shares of parent common stock acquired by the stockholder during the restricted period, except by exercise of an option. parent, at its discretion, may apply legends to the parent common stock concerning the foregoing and may cause stop transfer orders to be placed with its transfer agent with respect to the certificates representing the stockholder's shares of parent common stock. parent agrees, as promptly as practicable following the acquisition by parent of at least 95% of all of the outstanding capital stock of the calogic (and in no event later than february 29, 2000), to publish results covering at least 30 days of combined

237 whitney place fremont, ca 94539 and the common stockholders of calogic ladies and gentlemen: we have acted as counsel to sipex corporation, a massachusetts corporation ("sipex"), in connection with the agreement and plan of merger dated ----- as of october ___, 1999 by and among you, sipex and cat acquisition corporation i, a delaware corporation wholly owned by sipex ("merger sub") (the ---------- "reorganization agreement"). this opinion is furnished to you pursuant to and - ------------------------- in satisfaction of section 9.3(c) of the reorganization agreement. capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have meanings assigned to such terms in the reorganization agreement. in rendering our opinion, we have examined and relied upon originals or certified copies of the following: (1) the reorganization agreement and all schedules and exhibits thereto; (2) the articles of merger effective as of the date hereof; (3) the registration rights agreement dated as of the date hereof; (4) the escrow agreement dated as of the date hereof (the reorganization agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, the articles of merger, the registration rights agreement and the escrow agreement, collectively, the "transaction documents"); --------------------- (5) a certificate dated as of the date hereof of a vice president of sipex as to, among other things, the representations and warranties made by sipex in the reorganization agreement; (6) a certificate dated as of the date hereof of the clerk of sipex certifying (a) the resolutions of sipex's board of directors approving the reorganization agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, (b) the by-laws of sipex, (c) the restated articles of organization of sipex, as amended to date, and (d) the incumbency of sipex's officers signing any of the transaction documents or other documents delivered on behalf of sipex at the closing; and (7) such other documents, instruments, certificates and corporate records as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. in our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, whether certified or not, and the completeness of the corporate minute books and other record books of sipex. as to all matters of fact relevant to this opinion, we have assumed the completeness and accuracy of, and are relying upon, the statements set forth in certificates of public officials and officers of sipex and the representations and warranties of all parties set forth in the transaction documents, and have undertaken no independent verification of such facts. for purposes of this opinion, we have assumed compliance by you with all laws and regulations relating to your authority to enter into the transaction documents and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby, we have assumed that you have all requisite power and authority and have taken all action necessary for you to enter into the transaction documents and to effect such transactions contemplated thereby, and we have assumed that each of the transaction documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, each of the parties thereto other than sipex. this opinion is based upon our knowledge of the law and facts as of the date hereof and assumes no event will take place in the future which would affect the opinions set forth herein. we assume no duty to communicate with you with respect to any change in law or facts which comes to our attention hereafter. any reference to "our knowledge" or to matters "known to us" or "of which we have knowledge," or any variation thereof, shall mean the actual knowledge, but not including any constructive or imputed notice of any information, of attorneys in our firm who worked on the transactions contemplated in the transactions documents, without any independent investigation, except for inquiry of officers of sipex and merger sub. our opinion in paragraph 1 below as to incorporation and existence of sipex is based solely on a certificate received from the secretary of state of the commonwealth of massachusetts, and such opinion is limited accordingly and is rendered as of the date of such certificate. we are members of the bar of the commonwealth of massachusetts and have not made an independent review of the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than those of the commonwealth of massachusetts, the federal securities laws of the united states of america, and the general corporation law of the state of delaware. accordingly, we express no opinion herein with respect to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than those of the commonwealth of massachusetts, the federal securities laws of the united states of america, and the general corporation law of the state of delaware. to the extent that any of the transaction documents or any of the matters covered hereby are governed by the laws of the state of california, we have assumed (with your permission) that the laws of the state of california are identical to the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts. our opinion is qualified to the extent that: (a) the availability of equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific enforcement and injunctive relief, is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought; and (b) the enforceability of certain terms provided in the transaction documents may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally as at the time in effect and (ii) general principles of equity and the discretion of a court in granting equitable remedies (whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). in addition, we express no opinion as to anti-trust laws or regulations, or anti-fraud laws or regulations. we did not attend the closing of the merger, and our opinion is given on the assumption that -2- all of the transaction documents and the other documents delivered at the closing were executed by all of the parties thereto in the form most recently produced by us or supplied to us. based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the following opinion: 1. sipex is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts. sipex has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and to execute and deliver the transaction documents and to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the transaction documents. 2. each of sipex and merger sub has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the transaction documents and, except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents with the secretary of state of california, has taken all necessary corporate action to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. the execution, delivery and performance of the transaction documents by sipex and merger sub have been duly authorized by all necessary action of the board of directors of sipex and merger sub. other than the indemnification and contribution provisions of the registration rights agreement (as to which we express no opinion concerning the validity, binding effect or enforceability), the transaction documents constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations of sipex and merger sub in accordance with their terms. 3. neither the execution and delivery of the transaction documents by sipex and merger sub nor the consummation of the merger or any other transaction described herein, does or will, after the giving of notice, or the lapse of time, or otherwise, conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter documents of sipex or merger sub or, to our knowledge, any federal, state or local court or administrative order or process, or any united states federal law or commonwealth of massachusetts statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or the general corporation law of the state of delaware, or, to our knowledge, any contract, agreement or commitment to which sipex or merger sub is a party, or under which sipex or merger sub is obligated, or by which sipex or merger sub or any of the rights, properties or assets of sipex or merger sub are subject or bound which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission; to our knowledge, result in the creation of any lien upon, or otherwise adversely affect, any of the rights, properties or assets of sipex or merger sub; to our knowledge, terminate, amend or modify, or give any party the right to terminate, amend, modify, abandon or refuse to perform or comply with, any contract, agreement or commitment to which sipex or merger sub is a party, or under which sipex or merger sub is obligated, or by which sipex or merger sub or any of the rights, properties or assets of sipex or merger sub are subject or bound which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission; or, to our knowledge, accelerate, postpone, or modify the time within which, or the terms and conditions under which, any liabilities, duties or obligations are to be satisfied or performed, or any rights or benefits are to be received, under any contract, agreement or commitment to which sipex or merger sub is a party, or under which sipex or merger sub may be obligated, or by which sipex or merger sub or any of the rights, properties or assets of sipex or merger sub are subject or bound which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission, other than any of the foregoing which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business condition of sipex or merger sub. -3- 4. to our knowledge, except for (a) the filing of the appropriate merger documents with the secretary of state of california, (b) the filing of appropriate documents with the nasdaq stock market and (c) the filing of a form d and a form 8-k with the securities and exchange commission, if applicable, and except for such other consents which if not obtained or made would not have a material adverse effect on the business condition of sipex or the transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement, no consent, approval or authorization of or registration, declaration or filing with any united states federal, delaware or massachusetts governmental authority is required on the part of sipex or merger sub in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the transaction documents by sipex and merger sub. 5. the parent merger shares to be issued in the merger deliverable pursuant to the reorganization agreement will be, when delivered pursuant thereto, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal either under the business corporation law of the commonwealth of massachusetts or arising pursuant to any agreement or other instrument known to us to which sipex is a party or which is otherwise binding upon sipex. 6. based upon the representations of sipex and the calogic shareholders, the issuance and delivery of the parent merger shares pursuant to the reorganization agreement to the calogic shareholders do not require registration under the securities act or state securities laws. the opinions herein expressed are solely for the benefit and information of, and may be relied upon solely by you, and no other person shall be entitled to rely upon the opinions herein expressed. except with our prior written consent, the opinions herein expressed are not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to nor are they to be filed with any governmental agency or any other person. the opinion is rendered solely for purposes of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose. very truly yours, testa, hurwitz & thibeault, llp -4- ex-7.2 3 amd. no. 1 to plan of merger
