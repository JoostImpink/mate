party"), shall indemnify the other from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, charges, actions, proceedings, demands, judgments, settlement costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) or deficiencies (each herein called "claims") resulting from or arising in connection with any breach of a representation and warranty, covenant or agreement by the indemnifying party. 14.2 procedure. each party entitled to indemnification under this section 14 (an "indemnified party") shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each party required to provide indemnification under this section 14 (whether one or more, an "indemnifying party") of any claim for which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement so long as such failure shall not have materially prejudiced the position of the indemnifying party. upon such notification, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such claim if it is brought by a third party. after such assumption the indemnified party shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses incurred by it in connection with such claim except as described below. with respect to any such claim, the indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary or (ii) the named parties in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing or conflicting interests between them. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by such indemnifying party), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment or award resolving such claim, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss, damage or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. this section 14 shall survive closing, except as otherwise provided in section 11 hereof. 15. termination. this agreement may be terminated or, in the case of termination by the purchaser, the rights and obligations of the purchaser under this agreement may be terminated, (a) by the mutual written consent of the purchaser and the company at any time, (b) upon written notice, by the purchaser on the one hand or the company on the other hand if any representation or warranty of the other of such parties contained herein proves not to have been true and correct in any material respect when made, or (c) upon written notice, by the purchaser on the one hand or the company on the other hand if the other of such parties materially breaches any covenant hereunder. 16. rescission. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the purchaser complies with its obligation to make or cause to be made the appropriate doi filings within 45 days after closing: (a) if the doi disapproves the doi filings of the purchaser, the purchaser shall have the right to rescind this agreement, upon 30 days' written notice ("rescission notice") to the company of the purchaser's election to exercise its rescission right under 20 this section 16 ("rescission right"); and (b) in the event that the company does not receive rescission notice from the purchaser within 15 days after the doi's written notice of disapproval of the purchaser's doi filings, the purchase shall have waived the purchaser's rescission right. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the purchaser's rescission right is personal in nature and may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the company. if within 180 days after the closing the company has not either (x) settled the currently pending reinsurance arbitration proceeding between fic and clarendon whereby clarendon has agreed or is ordered to pay fic at least $5,000,000 or (y) purchased a reinsurance policy to insure against potential losses exceeding $5,000,000 but not exceeding $10,000,000 from the clarendon reinsurance arbitration proceeding currently pending between fic and clarendon, the purchaser shall have a right to exercise its rescission right after timely rescission notice to the company. in the event the company does not receive rescission notice within 15 days after the expiration of the 180 day period set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the purchaser shall have waived its rescission right. if a valid rescission occurs under this section 16, the company shall return to the rescinding purchaser the portion of the purchase price for shares paid to the company by such purchaser upon such purchaser's tendering to the company of the shares purchased or sought to be purchased by the purchaser under this agreement. 17. public announcements. the initial press release or releases concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form agreed to by the company and the purchaser. prior to closing, no party will issue any other press release or make any other public announcement concerning this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that a party may make such public disclosure as may be required by law, which includes, but is not limited to, all federal or state securities laws or a court of competent jurisdiction (in which event such party will notify the other parties as long in advance as practicable prior to making such disclosure and will, unless not practicable under the circumstances, give the other parties the opportunity to comment on the language of the disclosure prior to making such disclosure) or by any national securities exchange or over-the-counter quotation system on which the common stock is listed or quoted. 18. miscellaneous. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided that the purchaser may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of the purchaser's rights, interests or obligations under this agreement, without the prior written consent of the company. this agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the purchaser and the company and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. this agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the law of the state of florida without regard to the principles regarding conflicts of laws. the headings in this agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. this agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

(b) dividends. (i) the corporation shall not declare, make or pay any dividends or other distributions upon any junior securities until the first to occur of the following: (a) the third anniversary of the preferred stock issue date; (b) the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding voting or consenting as the case may be, as one class; or (c) the corporation achieves positive net income for three consecutive fiscal quarters after the preferred stock issue date. (ii) in the event that the corporation declares, makes or pays any dividends or other distributions upon the common stock (whether payable in cash, securities, rights or other property) other than dividends and distributions referred to in paragraph (c)(vi) of this section 5 of article iii (hereinafter in this section 5 of article iii, references to section 5 or subsections of section 5 of article iii shall be referred to as "section 5( )"), the corporation shall also declare and pay to the holders of the preferred stock, in addition to any dividends payable to them pursuant to the other provisions of this section 5, at the same time that it declares and pays such dividends or other distributions to the holders of the common stock (and with the same record date), the dividends or distributions which would have been declared and paid with respect to the common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock 25 had all of the outstanding preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution, or if no record date is fixed, the date as of which the record holders of common stock entitled to such dividends or distributions are determined. (iii) from and after the dividend commencement date, the holders of shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive on each dividend payment date in respect of the dividend period ending on such dividend payment date (but excluding such dividend payment date), cumulative dividends payable in shares of preferred stock at a rate per annum equal to 9% of the liquidation preference of each share of the then outstanding preferred stock; provided, however, that at any time after the preferred stock issue date, the corporation shall pay the dividends required under this section 5(b)(iii) as to particular shares of preferred stock in cash if requested in writing by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding, upon the affirmative vote or consent of the holders thereof. the dividends under this section 5(b)(iii) shall be fully cumulative and shall accumulate and accrue on a daily basis (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), whether or not they have been declared. (iv) so long as any shares of preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not pay or set apart for payment any full dividend on any of the parity securities or any dividend on any of the junior securities (other than dividends in parity securities to the holders of parity securities or dividends in junior securities to the holders of junior securities), or make any payment on account of, or set apart for payment money for a sinking or other similar fund for, the purchase, redemption or other retirement of any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities or any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities, and shall not permit any person directly or indirectly controlled by the corporation to purchase or redeem any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities or any such warrants, rights, calls or options, unless the accrued dividends on the preferred stock for all dividend periods ended on or prior to the date of such payment in respect of parity securities or junior securities have been or contemporaneously are paid in full. (v) if the corporation desires to make a partial dividend payment with respect to any parity securities at a time when any accrued dividends on the preferred stock have not been paid, it may do so as long as dividends upon shares of the preferred stock and upon such parity securities are paid pro rata so that the amount of dividends paid per share on the preferred stock and such parity securities shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that the accrued dividends per share on the preferred stock and the accrued dividends on such parity securities bear to each other. (c) conversion rights. (i) after approval or ratification by the shareholders of the corporation of the issuance of the shares of preferred stock, a holder of shares of preferred stock may convert such shares into common stock at any time on or before the third anniversary of the preferred stock issue date at the option of the holder thereof. except as set forth in the next sentence, for the purposes of conversion, each share of preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the 26 conversion date (defined below) to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. if a holder of shares of preferred stock gives written notice (a "dividend conversion notice") to the corporation at least two business days but not more than 60 days prior to giving a notice of conversion pursuant to section 5(c)(ii)(b) that it will be electing to convert a specified number of shares of preferred stock and that it elects to have any accrued dividends thereon that are payable prior to the conversion date but remain unpaid as of the conversion date converted into common stock on the conversion date (thereby affording the corporation the opportunity to pay such accrued dividends in cash prior to the conversion date so that they will not be converted into common stock), then for the purposes of conversion, each share of preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference plus the amount of accrued dividends thereon that are payable prior to the conversion date but remain unpaid as of the conversion date, if any, which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. immediately following any such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted preferred stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive the common stock upon the conversion of preferred stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such common stock. (ii) to convert preferred stock, a holder must (a) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed in a form satisfactory to the corporation, at the office of the corporation or transfer agent for the preferred stock, (b) notify the corporation at such office that he elects to convert preferred stock and the number of shares he wishes to convert, (c) state in writing the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued, and (d) pay any transfer or similar tax if required by clause (iv) below. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of preferred stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "conversion date." as soon as practical following the conversion date, the corporation shall deliver a certificate representing the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion, and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the conversion date. except as expressly set forth in section 5(c)(i) or in the following provisions of this section 5(c)(ii), no adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of preferred stock which have been converted. the holder of record of a share of preferred stock at the close of business on a record date with respect to the payment of dividends on the preferred stock in accordance with section 5(b)(i) hereof will be entitled to receive such dividends with respect to such share of preferred stock on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the conversion of such share after such record date and prior to such dividend payment date. if a holder of preferred stock converts more than one share at a time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total liquidation preference of all shares of preferred stock converted. (iii) the corporation shall not issue any fractional shares of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock. instead the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment based upon the closing price of the common stock on the 27 principal securities market or exchange on which the common stock is then listed on the business day prior to the conversion date. (iv) if a holder converts shares of preferred stock, the corporation shall pay any documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of common stock upon the conversion. however, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder's name. (v) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury enough shares of common stock to permit the conversion of the preferred stock in full. the corporation shall endeavor to list and keep listed on the nasdaq stock market, so long as the common stock shall be listed on the nasdaq stock market, all common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock. all shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation shall endeavor to comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock. (vi) in case the corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any class of capital stock of the corporation in common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of the holders entitled to such dividends and distributions. for the purposes of this section 5(c)(vi), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation. the corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the corporation. (vii) in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be reduced, and, conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be increased, in either case to equal the product of the conversion price in effect on such date and a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, as the case may be, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. such reduction or increase, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (viii) the capital reorganization, reclassification, conversion or exchange of common stock into securities, including securities other than common stock (other than a reclassification, conversion or exchange in connection with 28 a business combination to which section 5(c)(xiv) below shall apply), shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than common stock to all holders of common stock, and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification, conversion or exchange into the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification, conversion or exchange shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of section 5(c)(vii) above). (ix) no adjustment in the conversion price need be made until all cumulative adjustments amount to 1% or more of the conversion price as last adjusted. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. any adjustment to the conversion price carried forward and not theretofore made shall be made immediately prior to the conversion of any shares of preferred stock pursuant hereto. (x) for purposes of this section 5(c), "common stock" includes any stock of any class of the corporation which has no preference in respect of dividends or of amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the corporation and which is not subject to redemption by the corporation. however, subject to the provisions of section 5(c)(xiv) below, shares issuable on conversion of shares of preferred stock shall include only shares of the class designated as common stock of the corporation on the preferred stock issue date or shares of any class or classes resulting from any reclassification, conversion or exchange thereof and which have no preferences in respect of dividends or amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding- up of the corporation and which are not subject to redemption by the corporation, provided that, if at any time there shall be more than one such resulting class, the shares of each such class then so issuable shall be substantially in the proportion which the total number of shares of such class resulting from all such reclassifications, conversions or exchanges bears to the total number of shares of all such classes resulting from all such reclassifications, conversions or exchanges. (xi) whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the corporation shall promptly mail to holders of preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment. the corporation shall file with the transfer agent for the preferred stock, if any, a certificate from the corporation's chief financial officer briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it.

(c) effective registration statement. a registration requested pursuant to section 1(a) shall be deemed to have been effected if a registration statement with respect thereto has become effective, provided that a registration statement which does not become effective after fortune has filed a registration statement with respect thereto solely by reason of the refusal by the holders to proceed (other than a refusal to proceed based upon the written advice of counsel relating to a material matter regarding fortune) shall be deemed to have been effected by fortune at the request of such holders, unless (i) after it has become effective, such registration statement becomes subject to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason, other than by reason of an act or omission attributable to such holders with respect thereto; provided that upon the lifting of any such order registration will be deemed to be effective, or (ii) unless the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied, other than by reason of an act or omission attributable to the holders. (d) selection of underwriters. if a requested registration pursuant to section 1(a) involves an underwritten public offering, the managing or lead underwriter shall be selected by fortune and shall be reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities as to which registration has been requested, which shall not unreasonably withhold their acceptance of any such underwriters, and one co-managing or co-lead underwriter may be selected by the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities as to which registration has been requested and shall be reasonably acceptable to fortune, which shall not unreasonably withhold its acceptance of any such co-managing or co-lead underwriter. (e) priority on demand registrations. if a requested registration pursuant to section 1(a) involves an underwritten public offering and the managing or lead underwriter advises fortune in writing, with a copy to each holder requesting registration, that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration (including securities to be sold by fortune or by other persons who are not holders of registrable securities) exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders of a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities that are requested to be included in such registration without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, fortune shall include in such registration prior to the inclusion of any securities which are not registrable securities the number of registrable securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold in an orderly manner within the price range of such offering, pro rata among the respective holders thereof on the basis of the amount of registrable securities requested to be included. 44 (f) restrictions on demand registration. fortune shall not be obligated to effect any registration pursuant to section 1(a) during any of the following periods: (i) 30 days prior to the anticipated commencement of an underwritten public offering by fortune of its equity securities and 90 days subsequent to the consummation of such underwritten public offering unless, in the good faith judgment of the managing or lead underwriter or underwriters thereof, which is confirmed in writing, such filing would not have an adverse effect on such offering, (ii) if such filing is prohibited by applicable law or (iii) if fortune determines in good faith that the filing or effectiveness of such registration statement would require fortune to disclose a material financing, acquisition or other corporate transaction or development, and the proper officers of fortune shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is not in the best interests of fortune, provided that fortune may not delay the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement pursuant to this section 1(f) for more than an aggregate of 180 days in any twelve-month period; provided, further, that fortune shall file the registration statement and cause it to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after it shall determine in its good faith judgment that such registration will not materially interfere with or materially adversely affect the financing, acquisition or other corporate transaction or development. 2. piggyback registration. (a) right to piggyback. whenever fortune proposes to file a registration statement, other than pursuant to section 1(a) above, for the registration of shares of its common stock in connection with an underwritten primary public offering on behalf of fortune or an underwritten secondary public offering on behalf of other persons who are not the holders of registrable securities, fortune will, prior to such filing, give fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the holders of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of the holders given within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, fortune shall, subject to the terms of this agreement, use its reasonable efforts to cause the registrable securities which fortune has been requested to register by such holder to be registered under the securities act to the extent necessary to permit their sale. if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, fortune shall determine for any reason (other than by reason of acts or omissions attributable to any of the holders) either not to register or to delay registration of such securities, fortune may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay the registration expenses (as defined below) in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holders, if entitled to do so, to request that such registration be effected as a registration under section 1(a), and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registration, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. no registration effected under this section 2(a) shall relieve fortune of its obligation to effect any registration upon request under section 1(a), nor shall any such registration hereunder be deemed to have been effected pursuant to section 1(a). (b) priority in piggyback registrations. in a requested registration pursuant to section 2(a), if the managing or lead underwriters advise fortune in writing that in their opinion the number of securities 45 requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to fortune or the other persons who are not holders of registrable securities who requested the filing of a registration statement pursuant to section 2(a) above, fortune shall include in such registration (i) first, the securities fortune proposes to sell, and (ii) second, the registrable securities and securities held by other persons who are not holders of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the holders of registrable securities and the other persons who are not holders of registrable securities on the basis of the number of shares requested by each such holder of registrable securities and each other person who is not a holder of registrable securities to be included in such offering. 3. holdback agreements. (a) so long as a holder and its affiliates own common stock and/or preferred stock convertible into common stock exceeding 5% of the common stock of fortune then outstanding or such holder has the right to designate one or more directors to the board of directors of fortune (unless otherwise required by the underwriters), such holder of registrable securities shall not effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to rule 144) of equity securities of fortune, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the seven (7) days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten registration (except as part of such underwritten registration), unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering agree to a shorter restricted period. (b) fortune (i) shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the seven (7) days prior to and during the 90-day period beginning on the effective date of any underwritten demand registration or any underwritten piggyback registration (except as part of such underwritten registration), unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree, and (ii) shall use best reasonable efforts to cause each holder of at least 5% (on a fully-diluted basis) of its common stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, purchased or acquired from fortune at any time after the date of this agreement (other than in a registered public offering) to agree not to effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to rule 144) of any such securities during such period (except as part of such underwritten registration, if otherwise permitted), unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree. 4. registration procedures. whenever the holders of registrable securities have requested that any registrable securities be registered pursuant to this agreement, fortune shall use its reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto fortune shall as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and as soon as reasonably practicable file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities and use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective (provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, fortune shall furnish to 46 the counsel selected by the holders of at least a majority (by number of shares) of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents shall be subject to the review and reasonable comment of such counsel); (b) notify each seller of registrable securities of the effectiveness of each registration statement filed hereunder and prepare and file with the sec such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for a period of not less than 180 days and comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement; (c) furnish to each seller of registrable securities such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such seller; (d) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any seller reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition of the registrable securities owned by such seller in such jurisdictions (provided that fortune shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction); (e) notify each seller of such registrable securities, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and, at the request of any such seller, fortune shall promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchaser of such registrable securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made; (f) use its best reasonable efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange or over-the-counter quotation system on which securities of the same class are then listed or quoted; (g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such registrable securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement; 47 (h) otherwise use its best reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the sec, and make available to its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve months beginning with the first day of fortune's first full calendar quarter after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act and rule 158 thereunder; (i) if and to the extent that any seller of registrable securities, in its sole and exclusive judgment, might be deemed to be an underwriter or a controlling person of fortune, permit such seller to participate in the preparation of such registration or comparable statement and require the insertion therein of material, furnished to fortune in writing, which in the reasonable judgment of such seller and its counsel should be included; (j) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or of any order suspending or preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending the qualification of any common stock included in such registration statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use its best reasonable efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and (k) use its best reasonable efforts to cause such registrable securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such registrable securities. 5. registration expenses. fortune will pay or cause to be paid all registration expenses (as defined below) in connection with any registration of registrable securities requested pursuant to this agreement. "registration expenses" means all expenses incident to fortune's performance of or compliance with this agreement, including without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, listing expenses, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians, fees and disbursements of counsel for fortune and all independent certified public accountants, underwriters (excluding discounts and commissions) and other persons retained by fortune. registration expenses shall not include any taxes payable in connection with the resale of the registrable securities. 6. indemnification. (a) indemnification by fortune. fortune agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each holder of registrable securities, its officers, directors, partners, members, affiliates and each person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the securities act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, except as otherwise provided herein, fortune will reimburse such holder, officer, director, partner, member, affiliate and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, 48 liability or expense, except insofar as the same arise from or are based upon any information made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information provided to fortune by such holder for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the final prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after fortune has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same. in connection with an underwritten offering, fortune shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of registrable securities. (b) indemnification by the holders. in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to fortune in writing such information and affidavits as fortune reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify fortune, its directors and officers and each person who controls fortune (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to fortune by such holder for use in the preparation of such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided that the obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each holder. in connection with an underwritten offering, the holder, if selling registrable securities, shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of fortune. (c) notice of claims. any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires action other than the payment of money by the indemnifying party. an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment 49 of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. (d) survival of indemnification. the indemnification provided for under this agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, partner, member, affiliate or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. (e) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense referred to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by fortune on the one hand and the holder or other person, as the case may be, on the other from the distribution of the registrable securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of fortune on the one hand and of the holder or other person, as the case may be, on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by fortune on the one hand and the holder or other person, as the case may be, on the other in connection with the distribution of the registrable securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds received by fortune from the initial sale of the registrable securities by fortune to the holder pursuant to the stock purchase agreement bear to the gain, if any, realized by the selling holder or the underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriter, as the case may be. the relative fault of fortune on the one hand and of the holder or other person, as the case may be, on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by fortune, by the holder or by the other person and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, provided that the foregoing contribution agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any indemnified party if indemnification would be unavailable to such indemnified party by reason of the provisions contained in the first sentence of section 6(a), and in no event shall the obligation of any indemnifying party to contribute under this section 6(e) exceed the amount that such indemnifying party would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under this section 6 had been available under the circumstances. fortune and the holders of registrable securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 6(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders and any underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the preceding sentence and section 6(c), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. 50 no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 7. participation in underwritten registrations. no holder may participate in any registration hereunder which involves an underwritten offering unless such holder (i) agrees to sell the holder's registrable securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the parties entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. other agreements. fortune shall not enter into any agreement or instrument which would conflict with or result in a material breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement. in addition, fortune shall not enter into any agreement or instrument with any person which grants such person demand registration rights similar to those in section 1(a) which preclude the holders of registrable securities from exercising their rights pursuant to section 2(a) hereof in connection with any registration statement filed pursuant to which such person will sell securities of fortune. 9. definitions. as used in this agreement, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: "affiliate" shall have the meaning attributed thereto under rule 12b-2 under the exchange act.
