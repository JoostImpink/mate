class b ------- ------- rick antoine 260 260 stephen grant 240 240 tim zboyovsky 20 20 pacific western mortgage corp. 1080 1080 b. on february 7th, 1997, negotiations were commenced and agreement was reached, on a number of the basic terms of this agreement whereby the purchaser agreed to purchase all of the said shares of the capital stock of mwci in exchange for the issuance of certain shares of the purchaser's stock in accordance with an evaluation made as of that date, and which the parties now wish to consummate in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein; c. the respective boards of directors of both channel i inc. and mwci deemed it to be in the best interests of their respective companies to enter into this agreement, and have approved the terms and contents of this agreement and the execution thereof; now therefore, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual promises, covenants, terms and conditions herein, the parties covenant and agree as follows: 1. the exchange: 1.01 exchange of shares: subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, at the closing of the transactions described in this agreement: a) the vendors and each of them, shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the purchaser all of the said shares legally owned by them as previously described (hereafter referred to as the "control shares"), free and clear of all adverse claims, security interests, liens, claims and encumbrances (other than restrictions under applicable securities laws), and the purchaser shall accept and acquire the same; b) as payment in full for the control shares, the purchaser shall ratably issue and deliver to the vendors and aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of the company's authorized but unissued series b voting convertible preferred stock, $.001 par value per share, (hereafter referred to as the "exchange shares"); the exchange shares shall incorporate, inter alia, the right of conversion to common shares at a ratio of 10 common shares for each exchange share and the right to vote with each exchange share having 10 votes. the exchange shares shall be allocated among the vendors and issued in proportion to their ownership of control shares. the said exchange shares shall be held by the corporate secretary and shall be actually released to the vendors on the occurrence of the events and in the numbers set forth in schedule a hereto. in the event any one or more of the events described have not occurred prior to the expiration of 5 years from the date of execution of this agreement, the remaining exchange shares not so released, shall be cancelled by the company; provided however that the company, by its board of directors at their sole discretion and from time to time, may extend the said 5 year time frame for such additional time or times up to a cumulative period of 2 years, as it may deem advisable, where, in their sole discretion, the failure to do so would be unfair to the vendors. so long as any of the said exchange shares are held by the corporate secretary in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the registered owners thereof shall have full voting rights together with the right to received dividends, with all other rights associated with ownership of the said exchange shares to be subject to the terms of this paragraph. c) this agreement shall be deemed effective between the parties as of february 7th, 1997, when certain of its principal terms including the valuation of shares, were negotiated and agreed to. as of that date the market price of the purchaser's common shares was u.s. $0.0625 per share. 1.02 adjustment: the number of exchange shares shall be proportionally increased or decreased, should the purchaser's stock be subject to a forward or reverse split prior to closing. 1.03 entire purchase price: the exchange shares constitute the entire purchase price payable for the control shares. the exchange shares shall not be subject to any preemptive rights, options, or similar rights on the part of any shareholder or creditor of the purchaser or any other person or entity. the vendors hereby acknowledge the sufficiency of the purchase price, and upon consummation of the exchange, shall have no further rights in or claims to mwci and shall thereafter have only those rights accorded shareholders of the purchaser and as set forth in this agreement. 1.04 included assets: at the time of closing, mwci. shall continue to own all of the assets and properties, both tangible and intangible, of every kind and description, owned by it on this date, plus all assets and properties as may be acquired prior to closing and excepting properties, assets or cash expended solely in the ordinary course of business, without withdrawal or removal. 1.05 breaches and violations: if, and to the extent that the sale and purchase of the control shares is alleged to constitute a breach of any lease, loan or financing agreement, or other contract, license, franchise, permit, approval, trust or other property or contractual interest, or a violation of any law, decree, order, regulation, or other governmental edict, both the vendors and mwci shall expend all reasonable efforts at their respective expense, to obtain any consents and waivers of third parties or otherwise resolve any such breach or violation and the purchaser shall cooperate with them wherever possible. 1.06 assumption of ownership and possession: at closing, purchaser shall take ownership, possession and control of mwci, its books, records, properties, assets and operations in whatever form the same may be and wherever the same may be located. 1.07 continuing obligation of the parties: the parties hereto each agree that, should anything required to be done, conveyed or delivered by any party through inadvertence or otherwise, not be done, conveyed or delivered at closing, they will each do, or cause to be done, such further or other acts as may be required to complete the same. 1.08 securities not registered: mwci and the vendors each acknowledge and agree that the exchange shares have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (the "act"), in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by rule 902(c)(2) of regulation s under the act, on the grounds that the exchange herein is an offshore transaction, that none of the vendors is a "u.s. person" and that the exchange shares have been offered and will be issued solely outside the united states of america. each vendor understands and agrees that the prior written consent of the purchaser will be necessary for any transfer of any or all of the exchange shares, unless and until the securities have been duly registered under the act or the transfer is made in accordance with an available exemption from registration under the act. the purchaser similarly acknowledges that the control shares have not been registered under the act and are restricted securities. 1.09 restrictive legend: the vendors each acknowledge and agree, that, unless and until removed in accordance with law, all certificates which are issued evidencing the exchange shares, shall contain a customary form of investment legend in substantially the following form: "the shares evidenced by this certificate and any other securities of the corporation into which such securities may be converted or exchanged, have not been registered under the u.s. securities act of 1933, (the "act") but have been offered and sold in reliance upon regulation s under the act. transfer of these securities is prohibited except in accordance with the provisions of regulation s or pursuant to registration under the act.", and which legend shall include a self-liquidating or self-destructing date, where allowed by law. 1.10 closing: subject to the conditions precedent set forth herein, the closing of all transactions herein contemplated, ("closing"), shall take place at the offices of the purchaser c9. at 700, 555 west hastings st., vancouver, b.c., canada, on or before the 13th day of may, 1997, at a time mutually agreed upon, or such earlier or later date and time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties. this agreement shall be effective and binding when signed by all parties hereto. 1.11 the purchaser has registered its common shares under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"), and is subject to the information and reporting requirements of the exchange act. the purchaser, mwci and the vendors acknowledge that the following filings must be made with the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec"), in relation to this agreement and the transactions contemplated herein: a) a current report on form 8-k must be filed by the purchaser within 15 days following the execution of this agreement which describes in details the terms of this agreement and other required information, and certain audited and unaudited financial statements of mwci will need to be timely filed with the sec; b) if a majority of the purchaser's board of directors will change in connection with this agreement, a notice pursuant to sec rule 14f-1 must be filed with the sec and mailed to the purchaser's shareholders not less than 10 days before the new directors take office; c) every person who becomes an executive officer or director of the purchaser must within 10 days file with the sec a report of beneficial ownership of securities on form 3; d) upon consummation of this agreement, every person who as a result becomes the beneficial owner of more than 5% of purchaser's voting securities (including securities obtainable within 60 days upon exercise, exchange, or conversion of other securities), must within 10 days, file with the sec, a report of beneficial ownership of securities on schedule 13d, and e) upon consummation of this agreement, every person who as a result becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the purchaser's voting securities, (including securities obtainable within 60 days upon exercise, exchange or conversion of other securities), must file with the sec a form 3 containing all required information. 1.12 approval of certain actions by purchaser: mwci and the vendors acknowledge that they wish for the purchaser to: i) increase its authorized capital stock, and, ii) change its corporate name to waiverider communications inc. the vendors agree that they will, following consummation of this agreement and issuance to them of the exchange shares, vote such shares in favor of both proposals by means of a consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting. 1.13 sec investigation: the staff of the sec in 1994 commenced a private investigation into, among other things, certain past equity offerings made by purchaser. this is a civil, not a criminal, investigation. the current executive officers and directors of the purchaser had no involvement in the transactions which are the subject of the investigation. if the sec staff concludes that the purchaser, or affiliated persons, violated united states securities laws, it is possible that the sec will then initiate one of several actions against the purchaser and such persons. the potential actions which could be taken include a civil action for damages or for injunctive or other relief, or the commencement of administrative proceedings by the commission itself, against the purchaser or any affiliated individuals believed to have engaged in wrongdoing. the purchaser cannot at this time predict what action, if any, the sec staff or the sec itself, may later take, or what money damages or other relief it might seek, nor can the effect upon the purchaser by predicted. based on the facts known to management however, the purchaser does not believe that it or any affiliated persons engaged in violations of united states laws or rues or regulations thereunder. the purchaser has cooperated and intends to continue to cooperate with the sec staff in regard to this investigation. purchaser has had no communication with the sec staff for over a year and believes the investigation has, as a practical matter, ended, but no assurance of this can be made. 2. representations and warranties of mwci: mwci hereby represents and warrants that the following are true and correct as of the date hereof and

purchaser, vendor was outside the united states. vendor if an entity, was not formed for the purpose of investing in the exchange shares and maintains its business offices at the address shown in this agreement. b) vendor is accepting the exchange shares for its own account (and/or for the beneficial account of other non-united states persons who are outside the united states) and not on behalf of or for the account of any u.s. person; and vendor has not made any pre-arrangement to transfer the exchange shares to a u.s. person or to return the exchange shares to the united states securities market (which includes short sales in the united states within the restricted period to be covered by delivery of exchange shares) and is not accepting the exchange shares as part of any plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the securities act. c) vendor acknowledges and agrees that the offering restrictions applicable to the exchange shares restrict vendor from selling any of the exchange shares into the united states or to a u.s. person during the 40 day restricted period, commencing upon completion of the exchange (the "restricted period"); that such restricted period shall be deemed to commence on the date the purchaser certifies to be the date that all parties and all vendors have executed a counterpart of this agreement; and that the purchaser will instruct its transfer agent to place a stop transfer order with respect to the certificates representing the exchange shares and that such certificates shall bear a legend substantially in the form set forth in

aware of the said restrictions and that they will abide by all of the covenants applicable to such restrictions, given by the vendor herein. d) each vendor represents, warrants and hereby agrees that

made only pursuant to a registration of the exchange shares under the act or an exemption from registration. e) vendor has not engaged in any "directed selling efforts" (as defined in rule 902 of regulation s) in the united states regarding the exchange shares, nor has he, she or it engaged in any act which reasonably might have the effect of preconditioning the u.s. market for the resale of the exchange shares being subscribed. f) vendor is not an officer, director or affiliate (as that term is defined in rule 405 under the act), of the purchaser, or an underwriter or dealer (as such terms are defined in the federal securities law of the united states), and the purchase of the exchange shares by vendor is not a transaction, (or part of a series of transactions), that is part of
