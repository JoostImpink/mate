or free writing prospectus, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or (b) any application or other document or communication (in this section 7 , collectively called an &#147; application &#148;) executed by or on behalf of the company or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify any securities covered by such registration under the securities laws thereof, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or

made in such registration statement, any such prospectus, preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information prepared and furnished in writing to the company by such holder indemnified party expressly for use therein or by such holder indemnified party&#146;s failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the company has furnished such holder indemnified party with a sufficient number of copies of the same. in connection with an underwritten offering, the company shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers and directors, and each person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the securities act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holder indemnified parties. by each holder . in connection with any registration statement in which a holder is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the company in writing such information and affidavits as the company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the company, its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives, and each person who controls the company (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be

writing by such holder; provided that the obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each holder and shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. 16 claim procedure . any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall impair any person&#146;s right to indemnification hereunder only to the extent such failure has prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party&#146;s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. in such instance, the conflicted indemnified parties shall have a right to retain one separate counsel, chosen by the holders representing a majority of the registrable securities included in the registration if such holders are indemnified parties, at the expense of the indemnifying party. contribution . if the indemnification provided for in this section 7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to, or is insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party or is otherwise unenforceable with respect to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided that the maximum amount of liability in respect of such contribution shall be limited, in the case of each seller of registrable securities, to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such seller from the sale of registrable securities effected pursuant to such registration. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if the contribution pursuant to this section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account such equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject hereof. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(t) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 17 release . no indemnifying party shall, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 7 , an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the indemnifying party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. non-exclusive remedy; survival . the indemnification and contribution provided for under this agreement shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of registrable securities and the termination or expiration of this agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the ipo are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. underwritten registrations . participation . no person may participate in any public offering hereunder which is underwritten unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person&#146;s securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the person or persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (including, without limitation, pursuant to any over-allotment or &#147;green shoe&#148; option requested by the underwriters; provided that no holder shall be required to sell more than the number of registrable securities such holder has requested to include) and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and that are consistent in all material respects with the documents to be completed and executed by the holders. each holder shall execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the company and the lead managing underwriter(s) that are consistent with such holder&#146;s obligations under section 4 , section 5 and this section 8(a) or that are necessary to give further effect thereto and that are consistent in all material respects with the documents to be completed and executed by the holders. to the extent that any such agreement is entered into pursuant to, and consistent with, section 4 and this section 8(a) , the respective rights and obligations created under such agreement shall supersede the respective rights and obligations of the holders, the company and the underwriters created pursuant to this section 8(a) . price and underwriting discounts . in the case of an underwritten demand registration or underwritten takedown requested by a holder pursuant to this agreement, the price, underwriting discount and other financial terms of the related underwriting agreement for the registrable securities shall be determined by such holder. suspended distributions . each person that is participating in any registration under this agreement, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 5(a)(vi)(b) or (c) , shall immediately discontinue the disposition of its registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement until such person&#146;s receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by section 5(a)(vi) . 18 additional parties; joinder .

upon request, the company shall deliver to any holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. subsidiary public offering . if, after an initial public offering of the capital stock of one of its subsidiaries (including the company), the company distributes securities of such subsidiary to its equityholders, then the rights and obligations of the company pursuant to

identity of the selling holders), and (ii) there is no limitation on the duration of time that such holder and its representatives may be in possession of mnpi and no requirement that the company or other holders make any public disclosure to cause such information to cease to be mnpi; provided that the company will use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify each holder if any proposed registration or offering for which a notice has been delivered pursuant to this agreement has been terminated or aborted. 19 each holder agrees that it will maintain the confidentiality of such mnpi and, to the extent such holder is not a natural person, such confidential treatment shall be in accordance with procedures adopted by it in good faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to such holder (&#147; policies &#148;); provided that a holder may deliver or disclose mnpi to (i) its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, affiliates and financial

securities laws prohibit any person who has mnpi about a company from purchasing or selling, directly or indirectly, securities of such company (including entering into hedge transactions involving such securities), or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities, and (ii) agrees that it will not use or permit any third party to use, and that it will use its reasonable best efforts to assure that none of its representatives will use or permit any third party to use, any mnpi the company provides in contravention of the u.s. securities laws and it will cease trading in the company&#146;s securities while in possession of mnpi. each holder shall have the

opt-out request &#148;); in which case and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement the company and other holders shall not be required to, and shall not, deliver any notice or other information required to be provided to holders hereunder to the extent that the company or such other holders reasonably expect would result in a holder acquiring mnpi. an opt-out request may state a date on which it expires or, if no such date is specified, shall remain in effect indefinitely. a holder who previously has given the company an opt-out request may revoke such request at any time, and there shall be no limit on the ability of a holder to issue and revoke subsequent opt-out requests. 20 general provisions . amendments and waivers . except as otherwise provided herein, the

adversely affect any holder), shall be effective against such holder without the prior written consent of such holder. the failure or delay of any person to enforce any of the provisions of this
