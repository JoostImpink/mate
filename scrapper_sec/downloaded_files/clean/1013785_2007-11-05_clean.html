as an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal received after october 17, 2007: (a) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, by means of a merger, take-over bid, amalgamation, plan of arrangement, business combination or similar transaction, all of the common shares and offering or making available to all shareholders of the issuer on the same consideration in form and amount per common share to be purchased or otherwise acquired; (b) that did not result from a breach of dpm&#146;s non-solicitation covenants in the applicable lock-up agreement; (c) which complies with all applicable securities laws; (d) in respect of which any required financing to complete such acquisition proposal has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of dpm acting in good faith will be obtained;

(b) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after it has received any proposal, inquiry, offer or request) notify wega mining, at first orally and then in writing of (i) any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) that the locked-up shareholder receives, or becomes aware of, that relates to, or constitutes, or which could lead to, a bona fide acquisition proposal; or (ii) any request that the locked-up shareholder receives for discussions or negotiations relating to an acquisition proposal or for non-public information relating to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; and (c) exercise the voting rights attaching to the common shares held or controlled by the locked-up shareholder to oppose certain transactions which would reasonably be regarded as being directed towards or likely to prevent or delay the take-up of and payment for the common shares held or controlled by the locked-up shareholder or the successful completion of the offer or result in a material adverse effect in respect of the issuer. dpm has also agreed under the dpm lock-up table of contents page 8 of 14 agreement that from the earlier of the termination of the dpm lock-up agreement pursuant to its terms and the expiry time, it will promptly notify wega mining of any request that dpm receives for non-public information relating to any mineral property of the issuer or contractual or legal rights or for access to the issuer&#146;s properties, books and records or a list of the issuer&#146;s shareholders or any subsidiary of the issuer. a locked-up shareholder who is a member of the issuer&#146;s board of directors may engage, in its capacity as a director of the issuer, in discussions or negotiations with a person in response to a bona fide acquisition proposal made by such a person, which did not result from a breach of the applicable lock-up agreement or the support agreement. each respective lock-up agreement may be terminated by notice in writing: (a) at any time by mutual consent of wega mining, the offeror and the respective locked-up shareholder; (b) by the respective locked-up shareholder if, (i) wega mining and offeror have not complied in any material respect with their covenants contained in the applicable lock-up agreement or if any representation or warranty of wega mining or the offeror under the applicable lock-up agreement is untrue or incorrect in any material respect and such non-compliance or inaccuracy is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of the date which is 15 days from the date of written notice of such breach and the business day prior to the expiry date; (ii) the offeror has not (for any reason other than the failure of any locked-up shareholder to deposit its common shares for purchase) taken up and paid for all common shares deposited under the offer by the 120 th day following the date of the mailing of the offer in accordance with the support agreement; or (iii) the support agreement is terminated or, in the case of the locked-up shareholders other than dpm, the support agreement is terminated and no termination payment pursuant to the support agreement has occurred or been paid; provided in each case that the respective locked-up shareholder is not, at the time, in material default of its obligations under the applicable lock-up agreement; and (c) by wega mining if, (i) the respective locked-up shareholder has not complied in any material respect with all of its covenants contained in the applicable lock-up agreement and such default is not cured, or if any representation or warranty of the respective locked-up shareholder under the applicable lock-up agreement is untrue or incorrect in any material respect; (ii) any of the conditions of the offer are not satisfied or waived at the expiry time and the offeror elects not to waive such condition; or (iii) the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; provided in each case that wega mining is not, at the time, in material default of its obligations under the applicable lock-up agreement. additionally, the dpm lock-up agreement can be terminated by notice in writing if (a) dpm provides wega mining with notice in writing that there is a special superior proposal at least five businessddays prior to the date on which dpm proposes to accept or enter into any agreement relating to such special superior proposal; and (b) five business days have elapsed and dpm determined, in good faith, that the acquisition proposal is a special superior proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the offer by wega mining and offeror. during the five business day period referred to above or such longer period as dpm may approve for such purpose, wega mining and the offeror have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the support agreement and the offer and dpm has agreed to cooperate with wega mining and the offeror with respect thereto, including negotiating in good faith, to enable wega mining and the offeror to proceed with the offer and any contemplated transactions on such adjusted terms. dpm will review any table of contents page 9 of 14 proposal by wega mining and the offeror to amend the terms of the offer in order to determine, in good faith, whether any amendment would result in an acquisition proposal not being a special superior proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the offer. each reporting person reserves the right to change its plans and intentions at any time, as it deems appropriate. in particular, each reporting person may at any time and from time to time: acquire common shares or securities convertible or exchangeable for common shares;

if a letter of transmittal is executed by a person other than the registered holder of the certificate(s) deposited therewith, and in certain other circumstances as set out in the letter of transmittal, (i)&#160;the accompanying certificate(s) representing the common shares must be endorsed or be accompanied by an appropriate share transfer power of attorney, in either case, duly and

(a)&#160; the deposit is made by or through an eligible institution; (b)&#160; a properly completed and executed notice of guaranteed delivery (printed on green paper) in the form accompanying the offer, or a manually executed facsimile thereof, including a guarantee to deliver by an eligible institution in the form set out in the notice of guaranteed delivery, is received by the depositary at or prior to the expiry time at its office in toronto, ontario listed on the notice of guaranteed delivery;&#160;and (c)&#160; the certificate(s) representing all deposited common shares, together with a letter of transmittal (or a manually executed facsimile thereof), properly completed and executed as required by the instructions set out in the letter of transmittal (including signature guarantee if required) and all other documents required thereby, are received by the depositary at its office in toronto, ontario listed in the letter of transmittal before 5:00&#160;p.m. (toronto time) on the

delivery of the notice of guaranteed delivery and the letter of transmittal and accompanying certificate(s) representing common shares and all other required documents to any office other than the

following the procedures for a book-entry transfer established by cds, provided that a book-entry confirmation through cdsx is received by the depositary at its office in toronto, ontario at or prior to the expiry time. the depositary has established an account at cds for the purpose of the offer. any financial institution that is a participant in cds may cause cds to make a book-entry transfer of a shareholder&#146;s common shares into the depositary&#146;s account in accordance with cds procedures for such transfer. delivery of common shares to the depositary by means of a book-entry transfer will constitute a valid tender under the offer. shareholders, through their respective cds participants, who utilize cdsx to accept the offer through a book-entry transfer of their holdings into the depositary&#146;s account with cds shall be deemed to have completed and submitted a letter of transmittal and to be bound by the terms thereof and therefore such instructions received by the depositary are considered a valid tender in accordance with the terms of the offer. shareholders may also accept the offer by following the procedures for book-entry transfer established by dtc, provided that a book-entry confirmation, together with an agent&#146;s message in respect thereof, or a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal (including signature guarantee if required) and all other required documents, are received by the depositary at its office in toronto, ontario at or prior to the expiry time. the depositary has established an account at dtc for the purpose of the offer. any financial institution that is a participant in dtc may cause dtc to make a book-entry transfer of a shareholder&#146;s common shares into the depositary&#146;s account in accordance with dtc&#146;s procedures for such transfer. however, as noted above, although delivery of common shares may be effected through book-entry transfer at dtc, either an agent&#146;s message in respect thereof, or a letter of transmittal (or a manually executed facsimile thereof), properly completed and executed (including signature guarantee if required), and all other required documents, must, in any case, be received by the depositary, at its office in toronto, ontario at or prior to the expiry time. delivery of documents to dtc in accordance with its procedures does not constitute delivery to the depositary. such documents or agent&#146;s message should be sent to the depositary. the term &#147; agent&#146;s message &#148; means a message, transmitted by dtc to, and received by, the depositary and forming part of a book-entry confirmation, which states that dtc has received an express acknowledgement from the participant in dtc depositing the common shares which are the subject of such book-entry confirmation that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal as if executed by such participant and that the offeror may enforce such agreement against such participant. general the offer will be deemed to be accepted only if the depositary has actually physically received the requisite documents at or before the time specified. in all cases, payment for common shares deposited and taken up by the offeror under the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the depositary of (a)&#160;certificate(s) representing the common shares (or a book-entry confirmation for the common shares, as applicable), (b)&#160;a letter of transmittal, or a manually executed facsimile thereof, properly completed and executed, covering such common shares with the signature(s) guaranteed in accordance with the instructions set out in the letter of transmittal (or, in the case of common shares deposited using the procedures for book-entry transfer established by dtc, an agent&#146;s message), and (c)&#160;all other required documents. the method of delivery of certificate(s) representing common shares (or a book-entry confirmation for the common shares, as applicable), the letter of transmittal, the notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents is at the option and risk of the shareholder depositing those documents. the offeror recommends that those documents be delivered by hand to the depositary and that a receipt be obtained or, if mailed, that registered mail, with return receipt requested, be used and that proper insurance be obtained. it is suggested that any such mailing be made sufficiently in advance of the expiry time to permit delivery to the depositary at or prior to the expiry time. delivery will only be effective upon actual physical receipt by the depositary. 17 table of contents shareholders whose common shares are registered in the name of an investment advisor, stockbroker, bank, trust company or other nominee should immediately contact such nominee for assistance in depositing their common shares. all questions as to the

(ii)&#160;any of the conditions of the offer are not satisfied or waived at the expiry time and the offeror elects not to waive such condition; or (iii)&#160;the support agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; provided in each case that wega mining is not, at the time, in material default of its obligations under the applicable lock-up agreement. additionally, dpm&#146;s lock-up agreement can be terminated by notice in writing if (a)&#160;dpm provides wega mining with notice in writing that there is a special superior proposal at least five business days prior to the date on which dpm proposes to accept or enter into any agreement relating to such special superior proposal; and (b)&#160;five business days have elapsed and dpm determined, in good faith, that the acquisition proposal is a special superior proposal compared to any proposed amendment to the terms of the offer by wega mining and offeror. during the five business day period referred 39 table of contents to above or such longer period as dpm may approve for such purpose, wega mining and the offeror have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the support agreement and the offer and dpm has agreed to co-operate with wega mining and the offeror with respect thereto, including negotiating in good faith, to enable wega mining and the offeror to proceed with the offer and any contemplated transactions on such adjusted terms. dpm will review any proposal by wega mining and the offeror to amend the terms of the offer in order to determine, in good faith, whether any amendment would result in the acquisition proposal not being a special superior proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the offer. 7.&#160;&#160; background to the offer during march and april 2007, wega mining conducted an initial internal review of certain publicly available information pertaining to goldbelt and its properties and assets with a view to considering and evaluating whether to approach goldbelt with a possible strategic transaction opportunity. on april&#160;30, 2007, representatives of wega mining and goldbelt first met in london, england to discuss goldbelt&#146;s activities and capabilities in burkina faso, west africa, including with respect to goldbelt&#146;s inata gold project and certain other exploration properties based on the information publicly available concerning goldbelt and its property and assets previously assembled by wega mining. during that meeting, a senior representative of wega mining indicated to goldbelt that it was considering a number of companies, including goldbelt, for possible future investment purposes, and subsequently from may to june 2007, a number of discussions between senior representatives of goldbelt and wega mining ensued in which information regarding goldbelt&#146;s capital and funding requirements, having regard to its publicly-disclosed exploration and development activities and prospects, was provided to wega mining. during the first week of august 2007, representatives of wega mining and goldbelt first discussed the possibility of the parties negotiating some form of strategic transaction or partnership and, on august&#160;15, 2007, goldbelt and wega mining entered into an initial confidentiality agreement. between august 20 and august&#160;25, 2007, technical representatives of wega mining and senior officers of goldbelt met in burkina faso, west africa, to visit (between august&#160;21st&#160;and 23rd) certain exploration properties of goldbelt and to review confirmatory data relating to the 2006 prefeasibility study for the inata gold project previously made publicly available by goldbelt. on august&#160;30, 2007, senior officers of goldbelt and wega mining held a meeting in london during which discussions concerning goldbelt&#146;s operations, the inata gold project and its development and the possibility of pursuing a strategic transaction or partnership ensued. over the following two weeks, representatives of goldbelt and wega mining had various telephone discussions regarding the possible structures for a proposed strategic transaction or partnership between the companies and appropriate exclusivity arrangements and, on september&#160;18, 2007, senior officers of wega mining and goldbelt met in london, at which meeting representatives of goldbelt and wega mining had their first serious discussions regarding a strategic transaction and goldbelt raised the possibility of wega mining making an equity investment in goldbelt to assist goldbelt in securing necessary funding for its development projects. goldbelt and wega mining then entered into an additional confidentiality agreement on september&#160;21, 2007, which included a standstill provision, as subsequently amended on september&#160;25, 2007 and on october&#160;2, 2007, allowing wega mining to receive confidential information regarding goldbelt in connection with the potential acquisition of an interest in goldbelt or its properties. representatives of goldbelt and wega mining again held meetings over september&#160;24th&#160;and september&#160;25th&#160;at the denver gold show in colorado, united states, during which discussions as to possible alternative strategic transactions between the companies ensued. at the same time, representatives of wega mining also held their first discussions with representatives of dpm, the largest shareholder of goldbelt, to discuss the circumstances in which dpm might be willing to consider a sale of its shareholdings in goldbelt. from september&#160;26, 2007 to october&#160;16, 2007, representatives of wega mining and its legal and financial advisors undertook a confirmatory due diligence investigation of goldbelt and its subsidiaries for the purposes of confirming publicly available information concerning goldbelt and its subsidiaries and their respective property and assets. on september&#160;26th&#160;and 27th, a senior officer of wega mining held various meetings in toronto, ontario with senior representatives of goldbelt, during which time the possibility of wega mining and goldbelt entering into a strategic transaction and the proposed terms of such a transaction were further pursued, which included the possibility of wega mining making an offer for the common shares. various meetings were also held with representatives of dpm and with cormark securities inc. (&#147; cormark securities &#148;), goldbelt&#146;s financial advisor, concerning the possible terms on which dpm might be willing to consider a sale of its shareholdings in goldbelt and the possible terms on which goldbelt might be willing to consider a strategic transaction. during the following week, wega mining and its financial and legal advisors 40 table of contents had numerous internal discussions concerning the proposed structure, terms and financing of a possible strategic transaction with goldbelt. on october&#160;4, 2007, the board of directors of goldbelt formed the special committee to consider and evaluate a possible strategic transaction with wega mining. on october&#160;14, 2007, wega mining contacted certain senior representatives of goldbelt to advise them of wega mining&#146;s willingness to negotiate a subscription by wega mining for common shares of goldbelt, to provide goldbelt with a portion of the funds necessary to further develop certain mining assets in burkina faso, and a friendly offer for the common shares of goldbelt. on october&#160;15, 2007, counsel to wega mining provided goldbelt and its counsel with a draft support agreement and a draft of the lock-up agreement for certain directors and officers of goldbelt. a draft lock-up agreement for dpm was also provided to dpm and its counsel. between october&#160;15, 2007 and october&#160;17, 2007, discussions between senior officers and directors of goldbelt and wega mining and their advisors continued, including negotiation of the terms of the support agreement and the lock-up agreement for certain directors and officers of goldbelt, as did discussions among senior representatives of dpm and wega mining and their advisors concerning the proposed terms of the lock-up agreement with dpm. on october&#160;16, 2007, the board of directors of the offeror approved the entering into of the support agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder and on october&#160;17, 2007, the board of directors of goldbelt, with the recommendation of the special committee, approved the transaction and the related agreements. in the evening of october&#160;17, 2007, the support agreement and the lock-up agreements were finalized and signed by each of the applicable parties. on october&#160;18, 2007, goldbelt and wega mining issued a joint press release announcing the entering into of the support agreement, the lock-up agreements, the offeror&#146;s agreement to make the offer, subject to the terms and conditions of the support agreement, and the offeror&#146;s subscription for the private placement shares. see section&#160;5 of this circular, &#147;support agreement&#148; and section&#160;6 of this circular, &#147;lock-up agreements&#148;, for further details. 8.&#160;&#160; purpose of the offer and plans for goldbelt the purpose of the offer is to enable wega mining, through the offeror, to acquire beneficial ownership of all of the common shares. the effect of the offer is to give to all shareholders the opportunity to receive $1.55 in cash per common share, representing a premium of approximately 43% over the volume-weighted average trading price of the common shares on the tsx for the 20 trading days ending october&#160;17, 2007, the last trading day prior to the announcement of wega mining&#146;s intention to make the offer, and a premium of approximately 34% over the closing price of the common shares on the tsx on october&#160;17, 2007. if, within four months after the date of the offer, the offer has been accepted by holders of not less than 90% of the outstanding common shares as at the expiry time, the offeror may, to the extent possible, acquire the remaining common shares from those shareholders who have not accepted the offer pursuant to a compulsory acquisition. the offeror has covenanted in the support agreement that if a compulsory acquisition is not available or the offeror chooses not to avail itself of such statutory right of acquisition, the offeror will use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue other means of acquiring the remaining common shares not tendered under the offer. goldbelt has agreed that, in the event the offeror takes up and pays for common shares under the offer representing at least a simple majority of the outstanding common shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis as at the expiry time), goldbelt will assist the offeror and wega mining in connection with any subsequent acquisition transaction, provided that the consideration per common share offered in connection with the subsequent acquisition transaction is at least equivalent in value to the consideration per common share paid under the offer. provided that the offeror owns 66 2 / 3 % of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis and sufficient votes are cast by &#147;minority&#148; holders to constitute a majority of the &#147;minority&#148; on a fully diluted basis pursuant to rule&#160;61-501, the offeror should own sufficient common shares to effect a subsequent acquisition transaction. see section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#148;. if a compulsory acquisition is unavailable or if the offeror is unable to promptly obtain required approvals for a subsequent acquisition transaction, the offeror will evaluate its other alternatives. such alternatives could include, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, purchasing additional common shares in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in another take-over bid or otherwise, or selling or otherwise disposing of any or all of the common shares acquired pursuant to the offer. upon completion of the offer, wega mining and the offeror intend to conduct a detailed review of goldbelt and its subsidiaries, including an evaluation of their respective business plans, assets, operations and organizational and capital structure to determine what changes would be desirable in light of such review and the circumstances that then exist. promptly upon the initial take up and payment by the offeror of such number of common shares representing at least a majority of the outstanding common shares on a fully-diluted basis, the offeror will be entitled to requisition a meeting 41 table of contents of the shareholders at which the offeror may designate such number of members of the board of directors of goldbelt, and any committees thereof, as is proportionate to the percentage of the outstanding common shares beneficially owned from time to time by wega mining, to enable wega mining&#146;s designees to be elected or appointed to the board of directors of goldbelt, and any committee thereof. if permitted by applicable laws, the offeror intends to cause goldbelt to apply to delist the common shares from the tsx as soon as practicable after completion of the offer, any compulsory acquisition or any subsequent acquisition transaction. in addition, if permitted by applicable laws, subsequent to the completion of the offer and any compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction, the offeror intends to cause goldbelt to cease to be a reporting issuer under the securities laws of each province of canada in which it is a reporting issuer. see section&#160;17 of the circular, &#147;effect of the offer on the market for and listing of common shares and status as a reporting issuer&#148;. 9.&#160;&#160; regulatory matters to the knowledge of the offeror, no authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any public body, court or authority is necessary on the part of the offeror for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the offer, except for such authorizations, consents, approvals and filings the failure to obtain or make which would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by the offer. in the event that the offeror becomes aware of other requirements, it will make reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such approval at or prior to the expiry time, as such time may be extended. based upon an examination of publicly available information relating to the business of goldbelt, the offeror does not expect the offer, the compulsory acquisition or the subsequent acquisition transaction, as applicable, to give rise to material competition/antitrust concerns in any jurisdiction. however, the offeror cannot be assured that no such concerns will arise. 10.&#160;&#160; source of funds the offeror estimates that, if it acquires all of the common shares pursuant to the offer (including any common shares issued upon the exercise of all options and pursuant to performance rights), the total amount of cash required for the purchase of such common shares and to cover related fees and expenses of the offeror will be approximately $130&#160;million. this amount will be satisfied by the use of cash on hand. 11.&#160;&#160; ownership of and trading in securities of goldbelt except as described in section&#160;12 of the circular, &#147;commitments to acquire securities of goldbelt&#148;, no common shares, options, performance rights or other securities of goldbelt are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, nor is control or direction exercised over any of such securities, by wega mining or the offeror or their respective directors or senior officers. to the knowledge of wega mining and the offeror, after reasonable enquiry, no common shares, options, performance rights or other securities of goldbelt are owned, directly or indirectly, nor is control or direction exercised over any such securities, by any associate of a director or senior officer of wega mining or the offeror, any person or company holding more than 10% of any class of equity securities of wega mining or the offeror, or any person or company acting jointly or in concert with wega mining or the offeror. none of wega mining, the offeror or any director or senior officer of wega mining or the offeror or, to the knowledge of the offeror after reasonable enquiry, any of the other persons referred to above, has traded in any securities of goldbelt during the six months preceding the date hereof. other than wega mining, there is no person acting &#147;jointly or in concert&#148; with the offeror in connection with the transactions described in the offer and circular. 12.&#160;&#160; commitments to acquire securities of goldbelt in the support agreement, the offeror agreed to subscribe for 16,000,000 private placement shares from goldbelt at a price of $0.90 each for a total subscription price of $14,400,000 subject to, among other things, the approval of the tsx. the tsx has conditionally approved the listing of the private placement shares. the purpose of the subscription is to ensure that goldbelt has a portion of the funds necessary to further develop certain mining assets of goldbelt in burkina faso, west africa. the offeror&#146;s purchase of, and goldbelt&#146;s issuance of, the private placement shares pursuant to the subscription will be completed on the fifth business day after the commencement of the offer, or such other date as may be agreed upon by goldbelt, wega mining and the offeror. the subscription is not conditional on the successful completion of the offer. see section&#160;5 of the circular, &#147;support agreement&#148;. 42 table of contents the offer is not an &#147;insider bid&#148; for purposes of rule&#160;61-501, as neither of wega mining or the offeror is an &#147;issuer insider&#148; (as such term is defined in rule&#160;61-501) of goldbelt, or for purposes of regulation&#160;q-27. wega mining and the offeror have applied to the securities regulatory authorities of certain other provinces of&#160;canada for relief from certain insider bid related valuation and other requirements arising as a result the offeror&#146;s agreement to subscribe for the private placement shares. neither wega mining or the offeror is aware of, or has been provided with, any prior valuations (as such term is defined in rule&#160;61-501 and regulation q-27) made within twenty-four months of the date hereof, except for valuations or appraisals prepared by wega mining or the offeror or an entity retained by them for the purpose of assisting them in determining the price at which to make the offer. the offeror has also entered into lock-up agreements with certain locked-up shareholders pursuant to which each such locked-up shareholder has agreed to deposit under the offer and not withdraw, subject to certain exceptions, common shares representing, in the aggregate, 34,596,894 common shares or approximately 47% of the outstanding common shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis prior to taking into account the subscription for the private placement shares). see section&#160;6 of the circular, &#147;lock-up agreements&#148;. except as described above and other than pursuant to the offer, none of wega mining or the offeror or any director or senior officer of wega mining or the offeror, or, to the knowledge of the offeror, after reasonable enquiry, any associate of any such director or senior officer, any person or company holding more than 10% of any class of equity securities of the offeror, or any person or company acting jointly or in concert with the offeror, has entered into any commitments to acquire any equity securities of goldbelt. 13.&#160;&#160; material changes in affairs of goldbelt the offeror has no information which indicates any material change in the affairs of goldbelt since the date of the last published financial statements of goldbelt, other than the making of this offer by the offeror and such other material changes as have been publicly disclosed by goldbelt. the offeror has no knowledge of any material fact concerning the securities of goldbelt that has not been generally disclosed by goldbelt or any other matter that has not previously been generally disclosed but which would reasonably be expected to affect the decision of shareholders to accept or reject the offer. 14.&#160;&#160; acquisition of common shares not deposited it is the offeror&#146;s current intention that if it takes up and pays for common shares deposited under the offer, it will enter into one or more transactions to enable the offeror or an affiliate of the offeror to acquire all common shares not acquired under the offer pursuant to a compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction. there is no assurance that such transaction will be completed. compulsory acquisition if, within four months after the date of the offer, the offer has been accepted by shareholders who, in the aggregate, hold not less than 90% of the issued and outstanding common shares as at the expiry time, other than common shares held at the date of the offer by or on behalf of wega mining and its affiliates and associates (as such terms are defined in the bcbca) and the offeror acquires or is bound to take up and pay for such deposited common shares under the offer, the offeror intends, to the extent possible, to acquire those common shares (including common shares that are issued pursuant to performance rights or as a result of the exercise of outstanding options or other securities of goldbelt that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common shares) which remain outstanding held by those persons who did not accept the offer (and each person who subsequently acquires any of such common shares) (&#147; offerees &#148;) pursuant to the provisions of section&#160;300 of the bcbca on the same terms (including the per common share offer price) as the common shares acquired under the offer (a &#147; compulsory acquisition &#148;). to exercise such statutory right, the offeror must send notice (the &#147; offeror&#146;s notice &#148;) to each offeree of such proposed acquisition within five months after the date of the offer. if the offeror&#146;s notice is sent to an offeree under subsection 300(3) of the bcbca, the offeror is entitled and bound to acquire all of the common shares of that offeree that were involved in the offer for the same price and on the same terms contained in the offer (unless a court having jurisdiction orders otherwise on an application made by that offeree within two months after the date of the offeror&#146;s notice to goldbelt) and must pay or transfer to goldbelt the amount or other consideration representing the price payable by the offeror for the common shares that are referred to in the offeror&#146;s notice if the court has not ordered otherwise. pursuant to any such application, the court may fix the price and terms of payment for the common shares held by the offeree and make any such consequential orders and give such directions as the court considers appropriate. on receiving 43 table of contents the copy of the offeror&#146;s notice and the amount or other consideration representing the price payable for the common shares referred to in the offeror&#146;s notice, goldbelt will be required to register the offeror as a shareholder with respect to those common shares subject to the offeror&#146;s notice. any such amount received by goldbelt for the common shares is required to be paid into a separate account at a savings institution and, together with any other consideration so received, must be held by goldbelt, or by a trustee approved by the court, in trust for the persons entitled to that sum. the foregoing is a summary only of the statutory right of compulsory acquisition which may become available to the offeror and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of section&#160;300 of the bcbca. see section&#160;300 of the bcbca, a copy of which is attached as schedule&#160;a to this circular, for the full text of the relevant statutory provisions. section&#160;300 of the bcbca is complex and may require strict adherence to notice and timing provisions, failing which such rights may be lost or altered. shareholders who wish to be better informed about those provisions of the bcbca should consult their legal advisors. compelled acquisition if not less than 90% of the issued and outstanding common shares are acquired by or on behalf of the offeror and its affiliates and associates (which, for the purposes of this section entitled &#147;compelled acquisition&#148; will have the meanings given to them in the bcbca), any offeree of that class will be entitled, in certain circumstances and in accordance with the bcbca, to require the offeror to acquire such offeree&#146;s common shares. if the offeror has not sent the offeror&#146;s notice to an offeree within one month after becoming entitled to do so, the offeror must send a written notice to each offeree who did not accept the offer stating that the offeree, within three months after receiving such written notice, may require the offeror to acquire the common shares of that offeree that were involved in the offer. if an offeree requires the offeror to acquire the offeree&#146;s common shares in accordance with these provisions, the offeror must acquire those common shares for the same price and on the same terms contained in the offer. the foregoing is a summary only of the statutory right of compelled acquisition which may become available to offerees and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of subsections 300(9) and 300(10) of the bcbca. see subsections&#160;300(9) and 300(10) of the bcbca for the full text of the relevant statutory provisions. subsections&#160;300(9) and 300(10) of the bcbca are complex and may require strict adherence to notice and timing provisions, failing which such rights may be lost or altered. shareholders who wish to be better informed about those provisions of the bcbca should consult their legal advisors. subsequent acquisition transaction if the offeror takes up and pays for common shares validly deposited under the offer and a compulsory acquisition is not available or the offeror elects not to pursue a compulsory acquisition, the offeror currently intends, depending upon the number of common shares taken up and paid for under the offer, to take such action as is necessary or advisable, including causing a special meeting of shareholders to be called to consider an amalgamation, capital reorganization, share consolidation, statutory arrangement or other transaction involving goldbelt and the offeror and/or one or more affiliates of wega mining, for the purpose of enabling the offeror or an affiliate of wega mining to acquire all common shares not acquired by the offeror under the offer (other than the private placement shares) (a &#147; subsequent acquisition transaction &#148;) . the timing and details of any such transaction will necessarily depend on a variety of factors, including the number of common shares acquired under the offer. the offeror has covenanted in the support agreement that if a compulsory acquisition is not available or the offeror chooses not to avail itself of such statutory right of acquisition, the offeror will use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue other means of acquiring the remaining common shares not tendered under the offer. goldbelt has agreed that, in the event the offeror takes up and pays for common shares under the offer representing at least a simple majority of the outstanding common shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis as at the expiry time), goldbelt will assist the offeror and wega mining in connection with any subsequent acquisition transaction, provided that the consideration per common share offered in connection with the subsequent acquisition transaction is at least equivalent in value to the consideration per common share paid under the offer. provided that the offeror owns at least 66 2 / 3 % of the outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis and sufficient votes are cast by &#147;minority&#148; holders to constitute a majority of the &#147;minority&#148; on a fully diluted basis pursuant to rule&#160;61-501 and regulation q-27, as discussed below, the offeror should own sufficient common shares to effect such subsequent acquisition transaction. 44 table of contents a subsequent acquisition transaction described above may constitute a &#147;business combination&#148; or a &#147;going private transaction&#148; within the meaning of certain applicable canadian securities legislation including rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27. under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27, subject to certain exceptions, a subsequent acquisition transaction may constitute a &#147;business combination&#148; or a &#147;going private transaction&#148; if it would result in the interest of a holder or beneficial owner of common shares being terminated without such holder or beneficial owner&#146;s consent, irrespective of the nature of the consideration provided in substitution therefor. the offeror expects that any subsequent acquisition transaction relating to common shares will be a &#147;business combination&#148; or a &#147;going private&#148; transaction under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27. in certain circumstances, the provisions of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 may also deem certain types of subsequent acquisition transactions to be &#147;related party transactions&#148;. however, if the subsequent acquisition transaction is a &#147;business combination&#148; or a &#147;going private transaction&#148; carried out in accordance with rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 or an exemption therefrom, the &#147;related party transaction&#148; provisions therein do not apply to such transaction. the offeror intends to carry out any such subsequent acquisition transaction in accordance with rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27, or any successor provisions, or exemptions therefrom, such that the &#147;related party transaction&#148; provisions of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 will not apply to such subsequent acquisition transaction. rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 provide that, unless exempted, a corporation proposing to carry out a business combination or a going private transaction is required to prepare a formal valuation of the common shares (and, subject to certain exceptions, any non-cash consideration being offered therefor) and provide to the holders of the common shares a summary of such valuation or the entire valuation. in connection therewith, the offeror and wega mining intend to rely on any exemption then available pursuant to rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 and is seeking relief from the corresponding valuation requirements in certain other provinces of canada exempting the offeror, wega mining or goldbelt or their affiliates, as appropriate, from the requirement to prepare a valuation in connection with any subsequent acquisition transaction. an exemption is available under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 for certain business combinations or going private transactions completed within 120&#160;days after the expiry of a formal take-over bid if the consideration offered under such transaction is at least equal in value to and is in the same form as the consideration that the tendering shareholders were entitled to receive in the take-over bid and certain disclosure is given in the take-over bid disclosure documents. for these purposes, if shareholders will receive securities redeemed for cash within seven days of their issuance in consideration for their common shares in the business combination, the cash proceeds of the redemption, rather than the redeemed securities, are deemed to be the consideration received in the business combination. the offeror currently intends that the consideration offered under any subsequent acquisition transaction proposed by it would be equal in value to, and in the same form as, the consideration per common share paid to the shareholders under the offer (or securities redeemed for cash in such amount within seven days of their issuance, as permitted by rule&#160;61-501) and that such subsequent acquisition transaction will be completed no later than 120&#160;days after the expiry date and, accordingly, the offeror expects to rely on these exemptions or to obtain relief from the relevant valuation requirements of certain other provinces of canada, as applicable. see also section&#160;12 of this circular, &#147;commitments to acquire securities of goldbelt&#148;. depending on the nature and the terms of the subsequent acquisition transaction, the provisions of the bcbca and goldbelt&#146;s constating documents require the approval of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the votes cast by holders of the outstanding common shares at a meeting duly called and held for the purpose of approving a subsequent acquisition transaction. rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 would in effect also require that, in addition to any other required securityholder approval, in order to complete a business combination or a going private transaction, the approval of a majority of the votes cast by &#147;minority&#148; holders of the common shares must be obtained unless an exemption is available or discretionary relief is granted by the osc and the amf. in relation to any subsequent acquisition transaction, the &#147;minority&#148; holders will be, subject to any available exemption or discretionary relief granted by the osc and the amf, as required, all shareholders other than the offeror, any &#147;interested party&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27), certain &#147;related parties&#148; of the offeror or of any other &#147;interested party&#148; (in each case within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27) including any director or senior officer of the offeror, affiliate or insider of the offeror or any of their directors or senior officers and any &#147;joint actor&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27) with any of the foregoing persons. rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 also provide that the offeror may treat common shares acquired under the offer (including those deposited under the terms of the lock-up agreements) as &#147;minority&#148; shares and vote them, or consider them voted, in favour of a subsequent acquisition transaction that is a business combination or a going private transaction, provided that, among other things, (a)&#160;the business combination or going private transaction is completed not 45 table of contents later than 120&#160;days after the expiry date; (b)&#160;the consideration for each security in the subsequent acquisition transaction is at least equal in value to and in the same form as the consideration paid pursuant to the offer (and for these purposes, if shareholders will receive securities redeemed for cash within seven days of their issuance in consideration for their common shares in the business combination, the cash proceeds of the redemption, rather than the redeemed securities, are deemed to be the consideration received in the business combination); and (c)&#160;the shareholder who tendered such common shares to the offer was not (i)&#160;a &#147;joint actor&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation q-27) with the offeror in respect of the offer, (ii)&#160;a direct or indirect party to any &#147;connected transaction&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501) to the offer, or (iii)&#160;entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, in connection with the offer, a &#147;collateral benefit&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501) or consideration per common share that is not identical in amount and form to the entitlement of the general body of holders in canada of common shares. the offeror currently intends that the consideration offered under any subsequent acquisition transaction proposed by it would be equal in value to, and in the same form as, the consideration paid to the shareholders under the offer (or securities redeemed for cash in such amount within seven days of their issuance, as permitted by rule 61-501) and that such subsequent acquisition transaction will be completed no later than 120 days after the expiry date and, accordingly, the offeror intends to cause common shares acquired under the offer to be voted in favour of such transaction and to be counted as part of any minority approval required in connection with any such transaction. to the knowledge of the offeror, after reasonable inquiry, collin ellison, president and chief executive officer and a director of goldbelt, peter turner, vice-president, exploration and business development of goldbelt, paul morgan, executive chairman and a director of goldbelt, alexander dann, chief financial officer of goldbelt, and david mcnee, general manager of the inata gold project, may be deemed to have received a collateral benefit (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501). as a result, votes attached to common shares tendered to the offer by mr.&#160;ellison, mr.&#160;turner, mr.&#160;morgan, mr. dann and mr. mcnee will not be included in determining whether minority approval has been obtained for a subsequent acquisition transaction under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27. based upon information provided by goldbelt and, in the case of mr. ellison and mr. morgan, information provided by such individuals, the foregoing individuals collectively own (i) 2,590,400&#160;common shares, (ii)&#160;performance rights entitling such persons to obtain an aggregate of 1,800,000&#160;common shares, and (iii) options which are exercisable for an aggregate of 1,845,000&#160;common shares. as a result, if all of the foregoing individuals deposit their common shares under the offer and elect to exercise their options and to obtain the common shares issuable pursuant to performance rights and deposit under the offer all such common shares issued pursuant to performance rights or upon the exercise of options, votes attaching to an aggregate of 6,235,400 common shares held by such individuals will be excluded for the purposes of determining whether minority approval has been obtained for a subsequent acquisition transaction under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation q-27. in addition, the offeror must exclude the private placement shares to be acquired under the subscription in determining whether minority approval has been obtained for a subsequent acquisition transaction under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27. the only other common shares that the offeror anticipates will be required to be excluded in determining whether minority approval has been obtained are the common shares that the offeror may purchase through the facilities of the tsx, if any, as described in section&#160;12 of the offer, &#147;market purchases&#148;. in addition, under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27, if, following the offer, the offeror and its &#147;joint actors&#148; (within the meaning of rule&#160;61-501 and regulation q-27) are the registered holders of 90% or more of the common shares at the time the business combination or going private transaction is initiated, the requirement for minority approval under rule&#160;61-501 and regulation&#160;q-27 would not apply to the transaction if an enforceable right to dissent and seek fair value or a substantially equivalent right is made available to the minority shareholders. any subsequent acquisition transaction may also result in shareholders having the right to dissent and demand payment of the fair value of their common shares. if the relevant dissent procedures are complied with, this right could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value required to be paid to such dissenting shareholders for their common shares. the fair value of common shares so determined could be more or less than the amount paid per common share under the subsequent acquisition transaction or the offer. the timing and details of any compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction involving goldbelt will necessarily depend on a variety of factors, including the number of common shares acquired under the offer. although the offeror currently intends to propose a compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction on the same terms as the offer, it is possible that, as a result of the number of common shares acquired under the offer, delays in wega mining&#146;s ability to effect such a transaction, information hereafter obtained by the offeror, changes in general economic, industry, regulatory or market conditions or in the business of goldbelt, or other currently unforeseen circumstances, such a transaction may not be so proposed or may be delayed or abandoned. the offeror expressly 46 table of contents reserves the right to propose other means of acquiring, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common shares in accordance with applicable laws, including a subsequent acquisition transaction on terms not described in the circular. the offeror has covenanted in the support agreement that if a compulsory acquisition is not available or the offeror chooses not to avail itself of such statutory right of acquisition, the offeror will use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue other means of acquiring the remaining common shares not tendered under the offer. if the offeror is unable to or decides not to effect a compulsory acquisition or propose a subsequent acquisition transaction, or proposes a subsequent acquisition transaction but cannot obtain any required approvals promptly, the offeror will evaluate its other alternatives. such alternatives could include, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, purchasing additional common shares in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in another take-over bid or exchange offer or otherwise, or from goldbelt, or taking no actions to acquire additional common shares. subject to applicable laws, any additional purchases of common shares could be at a price greater than, equal to, or less than the price to be paid for common shares under the offer and could be for cash, securities and/or other consideration. alternatively, the offeror may take no action to acquire additional common shares, or may even sell or otherwise dispose of any or all common shares acquired under the offer, on terms and at prices then determined by the offeror, which may vary from the price paid for common shares under the offer. the tax consequences to a shareholder of a subsequent acquisition transaction may differ from the tax consequences to such shareholder of accepting the offer. see section&#160;18 of the circular, &#147;certain canadian federal income tax considerations&#148;, and section&#160;19 of the circular, &#147;certain united states federal income tax considerations&#148;. shareholders should consult their legal advisors for a determination of their legal rights with respect to a subsequent acquisition transaction. judicial developments certain judicial decisions may be considered relevant to any subsequent acquisition transaction that may be proposed or effected subsequent to the expiry of the offer. prior to the adoption of rule&#160;61-501 (or its predecessor, osc policy 9.1) and regulation&#160;q-27, canadian courts had, in a few instances, granted preliminary injunctions to prohibit transactions involving business combinations or going private transactions. the offeror has been advised that more recent notices and judicial decisions indicate a willingness to permit business combinations or going private transactions to proceed, subject to compliance with requirements intended to ensure procedural and substantive fairness in the treatment of minority shareholders. shareholders should consult their legal advisors for a determination of their legal rights with respect to any transaction that may constitute a business combination or going private transaction. 15.&#160;&#160; benefits from the offer except as described herein, to the knowledge of the offeror, there are no direct or indirect benefits of accepting or refusing to accept the offer that will accrue to any director or senior officer of goldbelt, to any associate of a director or senior officer of goldbelt, to any person or company holding more than 10% of any class of equity securities of goldbelt or to any person or company acting jointly or in concert with the offeror (including wega mining), other than those that will accrue to shareholders generally. 16.&#160;&#160;agreements, arrangements or understandings other than the support agreement and the lock-up agreements and the revised employment agreements described below, there are (a)&#160;no arrangements or agreements made or proposed to be made between the offeror or wega mining and any of the directors or senior officers of goldbelt; and (b)&#160;no contracts, arrangements or understandings, formal or informal, between the offeror or wega mining and any securityholder of goldbelt with respect to the offer. other than the support agreement and the lock-up agreements and the revised employment agreements described below, there are no contracts, arrangements or understandings, formal or informal, between the offeror or wega mining and any person or company with respect to any securities of goldbelt in relation to the offer. see section&#160;5 of this circular, &#147;support agreement&#148; and section&#160;6 of this circular, &#147;lock-up agreements&#148;. 47 table of contents employment arrangements goldbelt has existing employment or service arrangements pursuant to which each of the named individuals currently provides his services to goldbelt (each an &#147; existing employment agreement &#148; and collectively the &#147; existing employment agreements &#148;). the offeror wishes to retain the services of the named individuals after the offeror has acquired common shares pursuant to the offer. to that end, goldbelt has agreed in the support agreement to use its best efforts to negotiate and enter into a new employment or service agreement (each a &#147; revised employment agreement &#148; and collectively the &#147; revised employment agreements &#148;) on terms satisfactory to the offeror, acting reasonably, in respect of each of the named individuals. further, it is a condition of the offeror taking up and paying for common shares deposited under the offer that collin ellison, the president and chief executive officer and a director of goldbelt, enter into a new employment agreement with goldbelt on terms satisfactory to the offeror, acting reasonably. see section&#160;4 of the offer, &#147;conditions of the offer&#148;. it is not a condition of the offer that any of the other named individuals enter into revised employment agreements with goldbelt. under mr.&#160;ellison&#146;s existing employment agreement with goldbelt, he is entitled to receive a salary of $281,250 per annum plus medical insurance benefits. mr.&#160;ellison is also entitled to participate in any incentive programs of goldbelt, including share option plans, share purchase plans, share bonus plans or financial assistance plans in the discretion of the board of directors of goldbelt. under his existing employment agreement, mr.&#160;ellison was issued 800,000 performance rights entitling him to receive 800,000 common shares, of which 600,000 performance rights had previously vested. mr.&#160;ellison was also granted options, all of which have vested, entitling him to 300,000 common shares upon exercise. completion of a change of control of goldbelt is considered a termination of mr.&#160;ellison&#146;s employment by goldbelt unless mr.&#160;ellison consents otherwise in writing. under his existing employment agreement, upon a change of control of goldbelt, goldbelt must pay mr.&#160;ellison an amount equal to 18&#160;months&#146; salary, in addition to any other amount payable to mr.&#160;ellison at law (such payment, including the similar payments to be made to the named individuals, being referred to as the &#147; change in control termination payments &#148;). in the event of a change of control of goldbelt, mr.&#160;ellison&#146;s unvested performance rights are accelerated and become due and issuable, which would entitle mr.&#160;ellison to receive 200,000 common shares. mr.&#160;ellison is also entitled to a cash bonus payment equal to the amount determined by multiplying 450,000 by the offer price payable per common share pursuant to any take-over bid, offer or arrangement which, if completed, would result in a change of control. under mr.&#160;ellison&#146;s revised employment agreement, the total compensation paid for the services of mr.&#160;ellison will be consistent with market compensation for employees with similar experience and responsibilities. it is expected that, under his revised employment agreement, mr.&#160;ellison will be entitled to receive benefits, options to acquire common shares of wega mining in accordance with wega mining&#146;s stock option plan (which options will have an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the market price of wega mining&#146;s common shares at the time of grant) and cash bonuses to be paid periodically over the ensuing 24&#160;months upon the satisfaction of specified performance criteria related to the development of the inata project. it is also anticipated that mr.&#160;ellison will receive an amount in cash equivalent to his change in control termination payment. the existing employment agreements for the other named individuals also provide for a base salary or fee, as applicable, as well as, in certain cases, benefits, options and performance rights. in addition, each of the other named individuals is entitled to 18&#160;months salary or fee, as applicable, upon a change of control of goldbelt unless the named individual consents otherwise in writing. under the revised employment agreements for the other named individuals, the total compensation paid for the services of the other named individuals will be consistent with market compensation for employees with similar experience and responsibilities and commensurate with similarly situated employees at wega mining. it is expected that under the revised employment agreements, the other named individuals will be entitled to receive benefits, options to acquire common shares of wega mining in accordance with wega mining&#146;s stock option plan and/or cash bonuses to be paid periodically over the ensuing 24&#160;months upon the satisfaction of specified performance criteria related to the development of the inata project. it is also anticipated that each of the named individuals will receive an amount in cash equivalent to his respective change in control termination payment. the terms of the revised employment agreements have not been finalized as of the date hereof. as the terms of the revised employment agreements have not yet been settled, the actual terms may differ from those described above. the revised employment agreements will be negotiated at arm&#146;s length with each named individual subsequent to the date 48 table of contents hereof. the entering into of a revised employment arrangement in respect of a named individual will not be conditional on such named individual supporting the offer in any manner. canadian securities laws preclude the offeror or wega mining from entering into any agreement, commitment or understanding with any securityholder of goldbelt that has the effect of providing to such holder consideration of greater value than that offered to the other holders of the same class of securities. the offeror intends to apply for a decision from each of the relevant securities regulatory authorities that the proposed revised employment agreements are being entered into for reasons other than to increase the value of the consideration paid to the named individuals for their common shares and may be entered into despite the prohibition mentioned above. 17.&#160;&#160;effect of the offer on the market for and listing of common shares and status as a reporting issuer the purchase of common shares by the offeror under the offer will reduce the number of common shares that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of shareholders and, depending on the number of common shares acquired by the offeror, could materially adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any remaining common shares held by the public. the rules and regulations of the tsx establish certain criteria which, if not met, could lead to the delisting of the common shares from such exchange. among such criteria are the number of shareholders, the number of common shares publicly held and the aggregate market value of the common shares publicly held. depending on the number of common shares purchased by the offeror under the offer, it is possible that the common shares will fail to meet these criteria for continued listing on such exchange. if this were to happen, the common shares could be delisted and this could adversely affect the market or result in a lack of an established market for such common shares. if permitted by applicable laws, wega mining and the offeror intend to cause goldbelt to apply to delist the common shares from the tsx as soon as practicable after completion of the offer, any compulsory acquisition or any subsequent acquisition transaction. if the common shares are delisted from the tsx, the extent of the public market for the common shares and the availability of price or other quotations would depend upon the number of shareholders, the number of common shares publicly held and the aggregate market value of the common shares publicly held at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in common shares on the part of securities firms, whether goldbelt remains subject to public reporting requirements in canada and other factors. after the purchase of the common shares and any compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction, goldbelt may cease to be subject to the public reporting and proxy solicitation requirements of the securities laws of certain provinces of canada. furthermore, it may be possible for goldbelt to request the elimination of the public reporting requirements of any province where a small number of shareholders reside. if permitted by applicable laws, subsequent to the completion of the offer and any compulsory acquisition or subsequent acquisition transaction, wega mining and the offeror intend to cause goldbelt to cease to be a reporting issuer under the securities laws of each province of canada where it is currently registered as a reporting issuer. 18.&#160;&#160; certain canadian federal income tax considerations in the opinion of davies ward phillips&#160;&#038; vineberg llp, counsel to the offeror and wega mining, the following summary describes the principal canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the disposition of common shares under the offer, a compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction to shareholders who, for the purposes of the income tax act (canada) (the &#147; tax act &#148;), and at all relevant times, hold their common shares as capital property, did not acquire the common shares pursuant to a stock option plan, and deal at arm&#146;s length and are not affiliated with the offeror or goldbelt. common shares will generally be considered to be capital property to a shareholder unless the shareholder holds such shares in the course of carrying on a business or the shareholder has acquired such shares in a transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. certain canadian resident shareholders whose common shares might not otherwise be considered capital property may be entitled to make an irrevocable election under subsection 39(4) of the tax act to have their common shares and all other &#147;canadian securities&#148; (as defined in the tax act) owned by such shareholder in the taxation year in which the election is made, and in all subsequent taxation years, deemed to be capital property. this summary is based upon the current provisions of the tax act and the regulations thereunder (the &#147; regulations &#148;) and counsel&#146;s understanding of the administrative practices of the canada revenue agency (&#147; cra &#148;) published in writing prior to the date hereof. this summary also takes into account all specific proposals to amend the tax act and the regulations publicly announced by or on behalf of the minister of finance (canada) prior to 49 table of contents the date hereof (the &#147; tax proposals &#148;), and assumes that all tax proposals will be enacted in the form proposed. however, there can be no assurance that the tax proposals will be enacted in their current form, or at all. this summary is not exhaustive of all possible canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the tax proposals, does not take into account or anticipate any changes in law or administrative practice, whether by legislative, regulatory, administrative or judicial action or decision, nor does it take into account or consider other federal or any provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations, which may differ significantly from the canadian federal income tax considerations described herein. this summary is not applicable to a shareholder that is (a)&#160;a &#147;financial institution&#148; as defined in the tax act for the purposes of the &#147;mark-to-market&#148; rules, (b)&#160;a &#147;specified financial institution&#148; as defined in the tax act, or (c)&#160;a shareholder an interest in which is, or for whom a common share would be, a &#147;tax shelter investment&#148; as defined in the tax act. such shareholders should consult their own tax advisors. this summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular shareholder. this summary is not exhaustive of all canadian federal income tax considerations. consequently, shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors for advice regarding the income tax consequences to them of disposing of their common shares under the offer, a compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction having regard to their own particular circumstances, and any other consequences to them of such transactions under canadian federal, provincial, territorial or local tax laws and under foreign tax laws. shareholders resident in canada the following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a shareholder who, at all relevant times, for purposes of the tax act and any applicable income tax treaty is, or is deemed to be, resident in canada (a &#147; resident holder &#148;). sale pursuant to the offer a resident holder who disposes of common shares to the offeror under the offer will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the amount by which the cash received for the common shares, less any reasonable costs of disposition, exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the common shares to the resident holder. generally, a resident holder is required to include in computing its income for a taxation year one-half of the amount of any capital gain (a &#147; taxable capital gain &#148;) realized in such taxation year. subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the tax act, a resident holder is required to deduct one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an &#147; allowable capital loss &#148;) realized in a taxation year from taxable capital gains realized by the resident holder in the year. allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains for the year may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years in the circumstances described in the tax act. capital gains realized by individuals and certain trusts may give rise to a liability for alternative minimum tax under the tax act. the amount of any capital loss realized by a resident holder that is a corporation on the disposition of a common share may be reduced by the amount of dividends previously received or deemed to have been received on such common share, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the tax act. similar rules may apply to a partnership or trust of which a corporation, trust or partnership is a member or beneficiary. such resident holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding these rules. a resident holder that is throughout the year a &#147;canadian-controlled private corporation&#148; as defined in the tax act may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax of 6 2 / 3 % on certain investment income, including taxable capital gains. compulsory acquisition as described in section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#160;&#151; compulsory acquisition&#148;, the offeror may, in certain circumstances, acquire common shares pursuant to section&#160;300 of the bcbca. a resident holder disposing of common shares pursuant to a compulsory acquisition will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) generally calculated in the same manner and with the tax consequences as described above under &#147;shareholders resident in canada&#160;&#151; sale pursuant to the offer&#148;. a resident holder who obtains an order of a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of a compulsory acquisition and receives a cash payment from the offeror for its common shares will be considered to have disposed of the common 50 table of contents shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received (not including the amount of any interest awarded by the court). as a result, a resident holder will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) generally calculated in the same manner and with the tax consequences as described above under &#147;shareholders resident in canada&#160;&#151; sale pursuant to the offer&#148;. any interest awarded to a dissenting resident holder by the court must be included in computing such resident holder&#146;s income for the purposes of the tax act. subsequent acquisition transaction as described in section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#160;&#151; subsequent acquisition transaction&#148;, if the compulsory acquisition provisions of section&#160;300 of the bcbca are not utilized, the offeror may propose other means of acquiring the remaining issued and outstanding common shares. a subsequent acquisition transaction may be effected by an amalgamation, capital reorganization, share consolidation, statutory arrangement or other transaction. the tax treatment of a subsequent acquisition transaction to a resident holder will depend upon the exact manner in which the subsequent acquisition transaction is carried out. resident holders should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the income tax consequences to them of having their common shares acquired pursuant to a subsequent acquisition transaction. by way of example, a subsequent acquisition transaction could be implemented by means of an amalgamation of goldbelt with the offeror and/or one or more of its affiliates pursuant to which resident holders who have not tendered their common shares under the offer would have their common shares exchanged on the amalgamation for redeemable preference shares of the amalgamated corporation (&#147; redeemable shares &#148;) which would then be immediately redeemed for cash. in those circumstances, a resident holder would not realize a capital gain or capital loss as a result of such exchange of common shares for redeemable shares, and the cost of the redeemable shares received would be the aggregate adjusted cost base of the common shares to the resident holder immediately before the amalgamation. upon redemption of its redeemable shares, the resident holder would be deemed to have received a dividend (subject to the potential application of subsection 55(2) of the tax act to resident holders that are corporations, as discussed below) equal to the amount by which the redemption price of the redeemable shares exceeds their paid-up capital for purposes of the tax act. the difference between the redemption price and the amount of the deemed dividend would be treated as proceeds of disposition of such shares for purposes of computing any capital gain or capital loss arising on the redemption of such shares. subsection 55(2) of the tax act provides that where a resident holder that is a corporation is deemed to receive a dividend under the circumstances described above, all or part of the deemed dividend may be treated instead as proceeds of disposition of the redeemable shares for the purpose of computing the resident holder&#146;s capital gain on the redemption of such shares. accordingly, resident holders that are corporations should consult their own tax advisors for specific advice with respect to the potential application of this provision. subject to the potential application of this provision, dividends deemed to be received by a resident holder that is a corporation as a result of the redemption of the redeemable shares will be included in computing its income, but normally will also be deductible in computing its taxable income. a resident holder that is a &#147;private corporation&#148; or a &#147;subject corporation&#148; (as such terms are defined in the tax act) may be liable to pay the 33 1 / 3 % refundable tax under part&#160;iv of the tax act on dividends deemed to be received on the redeemable shares to the extent that such dividends are deductible in computing the resident holder&#146;s taxable income. in the case of a resident holder who is an individual, dividends deemed to be received as a result of the redemption of the redeemable shares will be included in computing the resident holder&#146;s income and will be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax credit rules normally applicable to taxable dividends paid by a taxable canadian corporation. a dividend will be eligible for an enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit if the recipient receives written notice from the issuer of the redeemable shares designating the dividend as an &#147;eligible dividend&#148; within the meaning of the tax act. pursuant to the current administrative practice of the cra, a resident holder who exercises his or her statutory right of dissent in respect of an amalgamation would be considered to have disposed of his or her common shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount paid by the amalgamated corporation to the dissenting resident holder (other than interest awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction). as a result, a resident holder will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) generally calculated in the same manner and with the tax consequences as described above under &#147;shareholders resident in canada&#160;&#151; sale pursuant to the offer&#148;. any interest awarded to a dissenting resident holder by the court must be included in computing such resident holder&#146;s income for the purposes of the tax act. 51 table of contents shareholders not resident in canada the following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a shareholder who, at all relevant times, for purposes of the tax act and any applicable income tax treaty, is not resident in canada, nor deemed to be resident in canada, and does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, common shares in connection with carrying on a business in canada (a &#147; non-resident holder &#148;). special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a non-resident that is an insurer carrying on business in canada and elsewhere. disposition of common shares pursuant to the offer or a compulsory acquisition a non-resident holder who disposes of common shares under the offer or a compulsory acquisition will realize a capital gain or a capital loss computed in the manner described above under &#147;shareholders resident in canada&#160;&#151; sale pursuant to the offer&#148;. a non-resident holder will not be subject to tax under the tax act on any capital gain realized on the disposition of common shares pursuant to the offer or compulsory acquisition unless the common shares constitute &#147;taxable canadian property&#148; to the non-resident holder and do not constitute &#147;treaty-protected property&#148;. generally, a common share will not constitute &#147;taxable canadian property&#148; to a non-resident holder at a particular time, provided that (a)&#160;such common share is listed on a prescribed stock exchange (which currently includes the tsx) at that time, (b)&#160;the non-resident holder, persons with whom the non-resident holder does not deal at arm&#146;s length, or the non-resident holder together with such persons have not owned 25% or more of the shares of any class or series of goldbelt at any time within the 60-month period immediately preceding that time and (c)&#160;the common share is not deemed to be taxable canadian property for purposes of the tax act. see &#147;delisting of common shares following completion of the offer&#148; below, in the case where common shares are delisted prior to a compulsory acquisition. even if the common shares are taxable canadian property to a non-resident holder, a taxable capital gain resulting from the disposition of the common shares will not be included in computing the non-resident holder&#146;s income for purposes of the tax act if the common shares constitute &#147;treaty-protected property&#148;. common shares owned by a non-resident holder will generally be &#147;treaty-protected property&#148; if the gain from the disposition of such property would, because of an applicable income tax treaty, be exempt from tax under the tax act. by way of example, under the canada-us income tax convention (the &#147; us treaty &#148;), a non-resident holder who is a resident of the united states for the purposes of the tax act and the us treaty will be exempt from tax in canada in respect of a gain realized on the disposition of the common shares, provided the value of such shares is not derived principally from real property situated in canada. in the event that common shares constitute taxable canadian property but not treaty-protected property to a particular non-resident holder, the tax consequences as described above under &#147;shareholders resident in canada&#160;&#151; sale pursuant to the offer&#148; will generally apply. a non-resident holder who disposes of &#147;taxable canadian property&#148; must file a canadian income tax return for the year in which the disposition occurs, regardless of whether the non-resident holder is liable to canadian tax on any gain realized as a result. any interest awarded by the court and paid or credited to a non-resident holder who obtains an order of the court in respect of a compulsory acquisition will be subject to canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25%, subject to reduction pursuant to the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. where the non-resident holder is entitled to benefits under the us treaty, by way of example, and is the beneficial owner of the interest, the applicable rate is generally reduced to 10%, and may be reduced to 0% under the fifth protocol to the us treaty released on september&#160;21, 2007 and under the tax proposals. disposition of common shares pursuant to a subsequent acquisition transaction as described in section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#160;&#151; subsequent acquisition transaction&#148;, the offeror reserves the right to use all reasonable efforts to acquire the balance of common shares not acquired under the offer or by compulsory acquisition. a subsequent acquisition transaction may be effected by an amalgamation, capital reorganization, share consolidation, statutory arrangement or other transaction. the canadian federal income tax consequences of a subsequent acquisition transaction to a non-resident holder will depend upon the exact manner in which the subsequent acquisition transaction is carried out and may be substantially the same as, or materially different from, those described above. see &#147;delisting of common shares following completion of the offer&#148; below, in the case where common shares are delisted prior to a subsequent acquisition transaction. a non-resident holder may realize a capital gain (or a capital loss) and/or a deemed dividend on the disposition of common shares pursuant to a subsequent acquisition transaction. capital gains and capital losses realized by a non- 52 table of contents resident holder in connection with a subsequent acquisition transaction will be subject to taxation in the manner described above under &#147;shareholders not resident in canada&#160;&#151; disposition of common shares pursuant to the offer or a compulsory acquisition&#148;. dividends paid or deemed to be paid to a non-resident holder will be subject to canadian withholding tax at a rate of 25%, subject to reduction pursuant to the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. where the non-resident holder is entitled to the benefits under the us treaty, by way of example, and is the beneficial owner of the dividends, the applicable rate is generally reduced to 15%. any interest paid to a non-resident holder exercising its right to dissent in respect of a subsequent acquisition transaction will be subject to canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25%, subject to reduction pursuant to the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty (10%&#160;under the us treaty, for example, with possible reduction to 0% under the fifth protocol to the us treaty and the tax proposals). delisting of common shares following completion of the offer as described above in section&#160;17 of the circular, &#147;effect of the offer on the market for and listing of common shares and status as a reporting issuer&#148;, the common shares may cease to be listed on the tsx following the completion of the offer and may not be listed on the tsx at the time of their disposition pursuant to a compulsory acquisition or a subsequent acquisition transaction. non-resident holders are cautioned that if the common shares are not listed on a prescribed or recognized stock exchange (which includes the tsx) at the time they are disposed of: (a)&#160; the common shares will generally be taxable canadian property for non-resident holders; (b)&#160; non-resident holders may be subject to income tax under the tax act in respect of any capital gain realized on such disposition (unless the common shares constitute &#147;treaty-protected property&#148;, as described above);&#160;and (c)&#160; the notification and withholding provisions of section&#160;116 of the tax act will apply to non-resident holders, in which case the offeror may be required to deduct or withhold an amount from any payment made to a non-resident holder in respect of the acquisition of common shares. a non-resident holder that disposes of &#147;taxable canadian property&#148; must file a canadian income tax return for the year in which the disposition occurs regardless of whether the non-resident holder is liable to canadian tax on any gain realized as a result. 19.&#160;&#160; certain united states federal income tax considerations the following summary describes the material us federal income tax considerations generally applicable to us shareholders (as defined below) with respect to the disposition of common shares under the offer (or a compulsory acquisition). this summary is based upon the us internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the &#147; code &#148;), treasury regulations, administrative pronouncements, and judicial decisions, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). no ruling will be requested from the us internal revenue service (the &#147; irs &#148;) regarding the tax consequences of the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) and there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the discussion set out below. the discussion does not address aspects of us federal taxation other than income taxation, nor does it address all aspects of us federal income taxation, including aspects of us federal income taxation that may be applicable to particular shareholders, including but not limited to shareholders who are dealers in securities, life insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, banks, non-us persons, persons who hold common shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities, persons who own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more, by voting power or value, of the outstanding shares of goldbelt, the offeror or wega mining, persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar or who acquired their common shares in a compensatory transaction, and persons who hold common shares as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for tax purposes. this summary is limited to persons who hold their common shares as a &#147;capital asset&#148; within the meaning of section&#160;1221 of the code. the discussion also does not address the us federal income tax consequences to holders of performance rights or to holders of options or any other securities of goldbelt that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common shares. in addition, it does not address state, local or non-us tax consequences. us shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the us federal, state, local and non-us tax consequences to their particular situations of the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) or other transactions described in section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#148;. as used herein, the term &#147; us shareholder &#148; means a beneficial owner of common shares that is, for us federal income tax purposes (a)&#160;a citizen or resident of the united states; (b)&#160;a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation 53 table of contents created or organized under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof or therein; (c)&#160;an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (d)&#160;a trust (i)&#160;that is subject to the supervision of a court within the united states and the control of one or more us persons as described in code section&#160;7701(a)(30) or (ii)&#160;that has a valid election in effect under applicable us treasury regulations to be treated as a us person. disposition of common shares a us shareholder who sells common shares in the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) generally will recognize a capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (other than amounts, if any, received in a compulsory acquisition that are or are deemed to be interest for us federal income tax purposes, which would be treated as ordinary income) and the us shareholder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common shares sold in the offer (or a compulsory acquisition). in general, capital gains recognized by an individual, estate or trust will be subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate of 15% if the common shares were held for more than one year. if the offeror is unable to effect a compulsory acquisition or if the offeror elects not to proceed with a compulsory acquisition, then the offeror may propose a subsequent acquisition transaction as described in section&#160;14 of the circular, &#147;acquisition of common shares not deposited&#148;. the us federal income tax consequences resulting therefrom would depend upon the manner in which the transaction is carried out. generally, if a us shareholder receives cash in exchange for common shares, it is expected that the us federal income tax consequences to the us shareholder will be substantially similar to the consequences described above. however, there can be no assurance that the us federal income tax consequences of a subsequent acquisition transaction will not be materially different from the consequences described above. us shareholders should consult their own income tax advisors with respect to the income tax consequences to them of having their common shares acquired pursuant to a subsequent acquisition transaction. this summary does not describe the tax consequences of any such transaction to a us shareholder. if a us shareholder is a cash-basis taxpayer who receives foreign currency, such as canadian dollars, in connection with the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) of common shares, the amount realized will be based on the us dollar value of the foreign currency received, as determined on the settlement date of such offer (or compulsory acquisition). if a us shareholder is an accrual-basis taxpayer, the us shareholder may elect the same treatment required of cash basis taxpayers with respect to the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) of common shares, provided the election is applied consistently from year to year. the election may not be changed without the consent of the irs. if a us shareholder is an accrual-basis taxpayer and does not elect to be treated as a cash-basis taxpayer for this purpose, the us shareholder might have a foreign currency gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes. any gain or loss would be equal to any difference between the us dollar value of the foreign currency received on the date of the sale in the offer (or in a compulsory acquisition) of common shares and on the date of payment if these dates are considered to be different for us federal tax purposes. any currency gain or loss generally would be treated as us source ordinary income or loss and would be in addition to the gain or loss, if any, recognized. foreign tax credits for canadian taxes paid or withheld a us shareholder that pays (directly or through withholding) canadian income taxes in connection with the offer (or a compulsory acquisition) may be entitled to claim a deduction or credit for us federal income tax purposes, subject to a number of complex rules and limitations. gain on the disposition of common shares generally will be us source gain for foreign tax credit purposes, unless the gain is subject to tax in canada and resourced as foreign source gain under the provisions of the us treaty. us shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the foreign tax credit implications of disposing of common shares in the offer (or a compulsory acquisition). information reporting and backup withholding payments in respect of common shares may be subjected to information reporting to the irs. in addition, a us shareholder (other than certain exempt holders including, among others, corporations) may be subject to backup withholding at a 28% rate on cash payments received in connection with the offer (or a compulsory acquisition). backup withholding will not apply, however, to a us shareholder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. backup withholding is not an additional tax. rather, any amount withheld 54 table of contents under the backup withholding rules will be creditable or refundable against the us shareholder&#146;s us federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the irs. 20.&#160;&#160; acceptance of the offer the offeror has no knowledge regarding whether any shareholders will accept the offer, other than the locked-up shareholders, who have agreed to accept the offer pursuant to the lock-up agreements. 21.&#160;&#160; depositary wega mining and the offeror have engaged computershare investor services inc. as the depositary under the offer. in such capacity, the depositary will receive deposits of certificates representing common shares and accompanying letters of transmittal

offeror for their services in connection with the offer, will be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against certain liabilities, including liabilities under securities laws and expenses in connection therewith. 22.&#160;&#160; information agent wega mining and the offeror have retained kingsdale shareholder services inc. to act as information agent in connection with the offer. the information agent will receive reasonable and customary compensation from wega mining and/or the offeror for services in connection with the offer and will be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket expenses. except as set out herein, wega mining and the offeror have not agreed to pay any fees or commissions to any stockbroker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of common shares under the offer; provided that wega mining and/or the offeror may make other arrangements with information agents for customary compensation during the offer period if they consider it appropriate to do so. 23.&#160;&#160; legal matters the offeror and wega mining are being advised in respect of certain matters concerning the offer by, and the opinions contained under &#147;certain canadian federal income tax considerations&#148; have been provided by, davies ward phillips&#160;&#038; vineberg llp, canadian counsel to the offeror and wega mining. 24.&#160;&#160;
