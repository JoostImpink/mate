(&#8220;shi&#8221;), a new jersey corporation. pursuant to the share exchange agreement, messrs qingtai liu and chenghai du, shareholders of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of shi, exchanged them for 9,125,000 newly-issued shares of the company. the share exchange transaction closed on may 15, 2007. &#160;

and (b) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value, of which no shares are issued or outstanding. as a result of the share exchange transaction, there had been a change in control in the company as both messrs qingtai liu and chenghai du constitute majority shareholders of the company. in connection with the closing of the share exchange agreement, former directors of the company, mr. daniel drummond and mr. alex ferries appointed qingtai liu as a director of the company, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company, appointed yongqiang wang as director of the company and submitted their resignation as directors and officers of the company, subject to the filing and dissemination of schedule 14f-1. on may 4, 2007, the company filed an information statement with the sec relating to the change in control of its board of directors containing the information required under rule 14f-1 of the exchange act and on may 4, 2007, the company distributed that information statement to all holders of record of its common stock. as a result thereof, immediately after the closing of the share exchange agreement and upon the expiration of the ten days from the mailing of the said information statement, there occurred a change in control in the board of directors as messrs. qingtai liu and yongqiang wang have became the entire board of directors of the company. &#160;
