(c) on may 10, 2010, z investment, on behalf of the funds, made a loan to zales in the principal amount of $150 million and received (a) a-warrants to purchase up to 6,389,378 shares of common stock of zales that are immediately exercisable and (b) b-warrants to purchase up to 4,675,306 shares of common stock of zales that will become exercisable, subject to stockholder approval, upon the earlier of (i) the date of the first meeting of zale&#146;s stockholders to approve the shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of the warrants and (ii) the date of the first annual meeting of zale&#146;s stockholders to be held after the issuance of the warrants (if stockholder approval is not received, the warrants will be exercisable for non-voting series a preferred stock of zales) (d) no person other than the reporting persons is known to have the right to receive, or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of common stock. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. on may 10, 2010, zales, and, in some instances, one or more of its subsidiaries, entered into (1) the credit agreement and warrant agreement with z investment. under the terms of the loan, zales borrowed $150 million at an interest rate of 15% per annum, 10% to be paid in cash and 5% eligible to be paid-in-kind at zales&#146;

provided , however , that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the administrative agent or any other credit party to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the administrative agent or any other credit party, or to present or file any claim or notice. it is understood and agreed that the appointment of the administrative agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 5.02, the power of the administrative agent to act in any name other than the name of the grantor shall not apply to any pledged collateral that is ulc shares. 20 section 5.03. no obligation to act. the administrative agent shall not be obligated to do any of the acts or to exercise any of the powers authorized by section 5.02, but if the administrative agent elects to do any such act or to exercise any of such powers, it shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a result of such exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to any grantor for any act or omission to act except for any act or omission to act which constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or breach of the contractual obligations of the administrative agent. the administrative agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the pledged collateral in its possession if such pledged collateral is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the administrative agent in such person&#146;s individual capacity, accords its own property consisting of similar instruments or interests, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that none of the administrative agent or any of the lenders shall have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any pledged collateral, whether or not the administrative agent or any lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any person with respect to any pledged collateral. the provisions of section 5.02 shall in no event relieve any grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other loan document with respect to the collateral or any part thereof or impose any obligation on the administrative agent or any other credit party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the administrative agent or any other credit party of any other or further right which it may have on the date of this agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other loan document, by law or otherwise. 21 article vi remedies section 6.01. remedies upon default. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, it is agreed that the administrative agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the ucc, the prucc or other applicable law. the rights and remedies of the administrative agent shall include the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default: (a) with respect to any collateral consisting of accounts, general intangibles (including payment intangibles), letter-of-credit rights, chattel paper, instruments and documents, the administrative agent may collect the collateral with or without the taking of possession of any of the collateral. (b) with respect to any collateral consisting of inventory, the administrative agent may conduct one or more going out of business sales, in the administrative agent&#146;s own right or by one or more agents and contractors. such sale(s) may be conducted upon any premises owned, leased or occupied by any grantor. the administrative agent and any such agent or contractor, in conjunction with any such sale, may augment the inventory with other goods (all of which other goods shall remain the sole property of the administrative agent or such agent or contractor). any amounts realized from the sale of such goods which constitute augmentations to the inventory (net of an allocable share of the costs and expenses incurred in their disposition) shall be the sole property of the administrative agent or such agent or contractor and neither any grantor nor any person claiming under or in right of any grantor shall have any interest therein. each purchaser at any such going out of business sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor. (c) with respect to any collateral consisting of intellectual property, on demand, to cause the security interest granted herein to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such collateral by the applicable grantors to the administrative agent or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis, any such collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the administrative agent shall reasonably determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers thereunder cannot be obtained). 22 (d) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, the administrative agent may enter upon, occupy and use any premises owned or occupied by each grantor, and may exclude the grantors from such premises or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied or used by the administrative agent. the administrative agent shall not be required to remove any of the collateral from any such premises upon the administrative agent&#146;s taking possession thereof, and may render any collateral unusable to the grantors. in no event shall the administrative agent be liable to any grantor for use or occupancy by the administrative agent of any premises pursuant to this section 6.01, nor for any charge (such as wages for the grantors&#146; employees and utilities) incurred in connection with the administrative agent&#146;s exercise of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies hereunder. (e) the administrative agent may require any grantor to assemble the collateral and make it available to the administrative agent at the grantor&#146;s sole risk and expense at a place or places which are reasonably convenient to both the administrative agent and such grantor. (f) each grantor agrees that the administrative agent shall have the right, subject to applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the administrative agent shall deem appropriate. each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any grantor. (g) unless the collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event the administrative agent shall provide the grantors such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances), the administrative agent shall give the grantors at least 10 days&#146; prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the date, time and place of any proposed public sale, and of the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the collateral may be made. each grantor agrees that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to that grantor which are imposed under the ucc, the prucc or other applicable law with respect to the exercise of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies upon default. the administrative agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such collateral shall have been given. the administrative agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. (h) any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the administrative agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. at any sale or other disposition, the collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the administrative agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. if any of the collateral is sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by the administrative agent on credit, the secured obligations shall not be deemed to have been reduced as a result thereof unless and until payment is finally received thereon by the administrative agent. 23 (i) at any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this section 6.01, the administrative agent or any other credit party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any grantor, the collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the administrative agent or such other credit party from any grantor on account of the secured obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the administrative agent or such other credit party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any grantor therefor. (j) for purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof. the administrative agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no grantor shall be entitled to the return of the collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the administrative agent shall have entered into such an agreement all events of default shall have been remedied and the secured obligations paid in full. (k) as an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the administrative agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the collateral and to sell the collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. (l) to the extent permitted by applicable law, each grantor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. section 6.02. grant of non-exclusive license. for the purpose of enabling the administrative agent to exercise the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies under section 6.01 (including in order to take possession of, hold, preserve, process, assemble, prepare for sale, market for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of the collateral) at such time as the administrative agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies under section 6.01, each grantor hereby (i) grants to the administrative agent, for the benefit of the administrative agent and the other credit parties, a royalty free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license, such license being with respect to the administrative agent&#146;s exercise of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies under section 6.01, including in connection with any completion of the manufacture of inventory or any sale or other disposition of inventory (a) to use, apply and affix any trademark, trade name, logo or the like in which any grantor now or hereafter has rights, (b) to use, license or sublicense any intellectual property, computer software now owned, held or hereafter acquired by such grantor, including in such license access to all media and to the extent to which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all such computer software programs and to the extent used for the compilation or print out thereof, provided that the administrative agent&#146;s use of the property described in subclauses (a) and (b) above will comply with all applicable law, and (c) to use any and all furniture, fixtures and equipment contained in any premises owned or occupied by any grantor in connection with the exercise of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies under section 6.01, and (ii) without limiting the provisions of section 6.01(c), agrees to provide the administrative agent and/or its agents with access to, and the right to use, any such premises owned or occupied by any grantor. 24 section 6.03. application of proceeds. after the occurrence of an event of default and acceleration of the secured obligations, the administrative agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the collateral, as well as any collateral consisting of cash, or any collateral granted under any other of the security documents in the manner set forth in section 8.04 of the credit agreement. section 6.04. voting rights. (a) so long as no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing: (i) each grantor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the pledged collateral of such grantor or any part thereof for any purpose. for so long as any grantor shall have the right to vote the pledged interests of such grantor, such grantor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the administrative agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to the pledged interests which would materially affect the rights of the administrative agent or any other credit party or the value of the pledged interests. the administrative agent shall execute and deliver to each grantor, or cause to be executed and delivered to such grantor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments as such grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such grantor to exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to this section 6.04(a)(i). (ii) each grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends, cash, options, warrants, rights, instruments, distributions, returns of capital or principal, income, interest, profits and other property, interests (debt or equity) or proceeds, including as a result of a split, revision, reclassification or other like change of the pledged collateral, from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed to such grantor in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the pledged collateral (any of the foregoing, a &#147; distribution &#148; and collectively the &#147; distributions &#148;) paid in respect of the pledged collateral of such grantor to the extent that the payment thereof is not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the loan documents; provided , however , that any and all distributions paid or payable other than in cash (other than in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution or in connection with a reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in-surplus) in respect of, and instruments and other property received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any pledged collateral, shall be, and, subject to the limitations in the definition of &#147;collateral&#148;, be promptly delivered to the administrative agent to hold as pledged collateral and shall, if received by such grantor, be received in trust for the benefit of the administrative agent, be segregated from the other property or funds of such grantor and be promptly delivered to the administrative agent as pledged collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). 25 (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default: (i) all rights of each grantor (x) to exercise or refrain from exercising the voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to section 6.04(a)(i) shall automatically cease and (y) to receive distributions that it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to 6.04(a)(ii) shall automatically cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the administrative agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual rights and to receive and hold as pledged collateral such dividends, interest and other distributions; provided that, unless otherwise directed by the required lenders, the administrative agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an event of default to permit the grantors to exercise such rights. any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the administrative agent pursuant to the provisions of this section 6.04(b)(i) shall be retained by the administrative agent in an account to be established by the administrative agent upon receipt of such money or other property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of section 6.03. after all events of default have been cured or waived and the borrower has delivered to the administrative agent a certificate to that effect, the administrative agent shall promptly repay to each grantor (without interest) all dividends or interest that such grantor would otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of this section 6.04 and that remain in such account. (ii) all distributions that are received by any grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section 6.04(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the administrative agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such grantor and shall be promptly paid over to the administrative agent as pledged collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). (c) this section 6.04 shall not apply to any pledged collateral that is ulc shares or to any distributions that are paid in respect of ulc shares. 26 section 6.05. ulc shares . (a) notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in this agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto, each grantor that is the registered and beneficial owner of any pledged collateral which are ulc shares (&#147; ulc pledgor &#148;) will remain so until such time as such ulc shares are effectively transferred into the name of the administrative agent, any credit party or any other person on the books and records of such ulc. accordingly, each ulc pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain for its own account any distribution in respect of such pledged collateral (except insofar as such ulc pledgor has granted a security interest in such distribution, and any shares which are pledged collateral shall be delivered to the administrative agent to hold as pledged collateral hereunder) and shall have the right to vote such pledged collateral and to control the direction, management and policies of the applicable ulc issuer to the same extent as such ulc pledgor would if such pledged collateral were not pledged to the administrative agent (for its own benefit and for the benefit of the credit parties) pursuant hereto. nothing in this agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto is intended to, and nothing in this agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto shall, constitute the administrative agent, any credit party or any other person other than a ulc pledgor a member of a ulc for the purposes of the companies act (nova scotia) until such time as notice is given to such ulc pledgor and further steps are taken pursuant hereto or thereto so as to register the administrative agent, any credit party or any other person as holder of the applicable ulc shares. to the extent any provision hereof would have the effect of constituting the administrative agent or any credit party as a member of any ulc prior to such time, such provision shall be severed therefrom and shall be ineffective with respect to pledged collateral which are ulc shares without otherwise invalidating or rendering unenforceable this agreement or invalidating or rendering unenforceable such provision insofar as it relates to pledged collateral which are not ulc shares. (b) except upon the exercise of rights to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the pledged stock issued by a ulc following the occurrence of an event of default pursuant to article vi, no ulc pledgor shall cause or permit, or enable any ulc in which they hold ulc shares to cause or permit, the administrative agent or any other credit party to: (i) be registered as shareholder or member of such ulc; (ii) accept or request stock powers of attorney in respect of such person endorsed or assigned in favor of the administrative agent or other credit party; (iii) have any notation entered in its favor in the share register of such ulc; (iv) be held out as a shareholder or member of such ulc; (v) receive, directly or indirectly, any dividends, property or other distributions from such ulc by reason of the administrative agent or any other credit party holding a security interest in such ulc; or (vi) act as a shareholder or member of such ulc, or exercise any rights of a shareholder or member including the right to attend a meeting of, or to vote the shares of, such ulc. 27 section 6.06. disposition of pledged collateral by administrative agent . none of the pledged collateral existing as of the date of this agreement is, and none of the pledged collateral hereafter acquired on the date of acquisition thereof will be, registered or qualified under the various federal or state securities laws of the united states and disposition thereof after an event of default has occurred and is continuing may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. each grantor understands that in connection with such disposition, the administrative agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the pledged collateral than if the pledged collateral were registered and qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. each grantor, therefore, agrees that: (a) if the administrative agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this agreement, sell or cause the pledged collateral or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, the administrative agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any nationally recognized brokerage or investment firm (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to offer the pledged collateral or any portion thereof for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof; and (b) such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that the administrative agent has handled the disposition in a commercially reasonable manner. article vii perfection of security interest section 7.01. perfection by filing. this agreement constitutes an authenticated record, and each grantor hereby authorizes the administrative agent, pursuant to the provisions of sections 2.01 and 5.02, to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the collateral, in such filing offices as the administrative agent shall deem appropriate, including recording of the ip agreements with the united states patent and trademark office, the united states copyright office, the canadian intellectual property office and the canadian industrial design office and the grantors shall pay the administrative agent&#146;s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. any such financing statement may indicate the collateral as &#147;all assets of the grantor&#148; or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset comprised in the collateral falls within the scope of article 9 of the ucc. each grantor hereby further agrees that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement and may be filed as a financing statement in any and all jurisdictions. section 7.02. other perfection, etc. the grantors shall at any time and from time to time take such steps as the administrative agent may reasonably request for the administrative agent (a) to obtain an acknowledgment, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent, of any bailee having possession of any of the collateral that the bailee holds such collateral for the administrative agent, (b) to obtain &#147;control&#148; of any securities accounts, concentration accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel paper, with any agreements establishing control to be in form and substance satisfactory to the administrative agent (and which may also be for the benefit of the abl agent), and (c) otherwise to insure the continued perfection of the administrative agent&#146;s security interest in any of the collateral with the priority described in section 3.03 and of the preservation of its rights therein. 28 section 7.03. savings clause. nothing contained in this article vii shall be construed to narrow the scope of the administrative agent&#146;s security interest in any of the collateral or the perfection or priority thereof or to impair or otherwise limit any of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies hereunder except (and then only to the extent) as mandated by the ucc or the prucc. article viii miscellaneous section 8.01. notices. all communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in section 10.02 of the credit agreement. section 8.02. security interest absolute. all rights of the administrative agent hereunder, the security interest and all obligations of the grantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the credit agreement, any other loan document, any agreement with respect to any of the secured obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the secured obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the credit agreement, any other loan document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the secured obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any grantor in respect of the secured obligations or this agreement. section 8.03. suretyship waivers by grantors. the grantors waive demand, notice, protest, notice of acceptance of this agreement, notice of loans made, credit extended, collateral received or delivered or other action taken in reliance hereon and all other demands and notices of any description. with respect to both the secured obligations and the collateral, each grantor assents to any extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security interest in any collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person primarily or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereon and the settlement, compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at such time or times as the administrative agent may deem advisable. the administrative agent shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the collateral or any income therefrom, the preservation of rights against prior parties or the preservation of any rights pertaining thereto. each of the grantors further waives any and all other suretyship defenses. 29 section 8.04. marshalling. neither the administrative agent nor any lender shall be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including the collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of the secured obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of the rights and remedies of the administrative agent or any lender hereunder and of the administrative agent or any lender in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. to the extent that it lawfully may, each grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the administrative agent&#146;s rights and remedies under this agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the secured obligations or under which any of the secured obligations is outstanding or by which any of the secured obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws. section 8.05. survival of agreement. all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the grantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this agreement or any other loan document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the administrative agent and the other credit parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of this agreement and the other loan documents and the making of any loans, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the secured obligations are outstanding and unpaid, and as long as the commitments have not expired or terminated. section 8.06. binding effect; several agreement; assignments. whenever in this agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party (subject to the provisions of the credit agreement), and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the grantors that are contained in this agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each grantor and its respective successors and assigns. this agreement shall be binding upon each grantor and the administrative agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of each grantor, the administrative agent and the other credit parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no grantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the collateral (and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly permitted by this agreement or the credit agreement. this agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each grantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any grantor without the approval of any other grantor and without affecting the obligations of any other grantor hereunder. section 8.07. administrative agent&#146;s fees and expenses; indemnification. (a) without limiting any of their obligations under the credit agreement or the other loan documents, the grantors jointly and severally agree to pay all credit party expenses incurred in connection with this agreement. 30 (b) without limiting any of their indemnification obligations under the credit agreement or the other loan documents, the grantors shall, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify each credit party and their respective affiliates (each such person being called an &#147; indemnitee &#148;), and hold each indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (other than with respect to taxes), including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for any indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery or performance of this agreement, the performance by any grantor of its obligations under this agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing or to the collateral, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any indemnitee is a party thereto; provided , however , that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or breach of the contractual obligations of such indemnitee or with respect to a claim by one indemnitee against another indemnitee. (c) any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional secured obligations secured hereby and by the other security documents. all amounts due under this section 8.07 shall be payable on written demand therefor. section 8.08. governing law. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this agreement and the secured obligations shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york, including sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the new york general obligations law, and any applicable laws of the united states of america. section 8.09. waivers; amendment.

(a) if the company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the common stock (other than one subject to section 5.01 or section 5.02), including in connection with a recapitalization event (it being understood that, if there is a distribution in connection with a recapitalization event and no record date is set therefor, the effective date of such recapitalization event shall be deemed to be the record date fixed by the company for purposes of this section 5.03), the exercise price immediately after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be determined by multiplying (a) the exercise price in effect on such record date by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading day before the date (the &#147; ex-date &#148;) on which the common stock first trades without the right to receive such dividend or distribution less the fair market value of the items distributed in respect of each share of common stock in such dividend or distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading day before the ex-date. as used in this section 5.03, &#147; recapitalization event &#148; means any consolidation, merger or similar extraordinary transaction (other than any consolidation, merger or similar extraordinary transaction of the company with an unaffiliated third party), or any recapitalization or reclassification of the common stock. upon any adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to this section 5.03, the total number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be such number of shares (calculated to the nearest hundredth) purchasable per warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading date before the ex-date, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading date before the ex-date less the fair market value of the items distributed in respect of each share of common stock in such dividend or distribution. (b) in the case of a recapitalization event in which outstanding shares of common stock are converted either solely or partially into shares of common stock of another company, each warrant shall become a warrant to purchase a number of shares of common stock of the other company for an exercise price per share calculated by (i) first, applying the rules in sections 5.01 or 5.02, as applicable, and section 5.03(a) to determine an initially adjusted exercise price per share and number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant, (ii) second, multiplying the initially adjusted number of shares by the number of shares of common stock of the other company into which each share of common stock of the company shall be converted in the recapitalization event to arrive at the final adjusted number of shares of common stock of the other company purchasable upon exercise of each warrant and (iii) third, dividing the initially adjusted exercise price per share of common stock by the number of shares of common stock of the other company into which each share of common stock of the company shall be converted in the recapitalization event to arrive at the final adjusted exercise price per share of common stock of the other company. in any case where this section 5.03(b) applies, the second sentence of section 5.05 shall also apply to the recapitalization event as though it were a reorganization event. (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the case of a recapitalization event, to the extent that one or more of the adjustments set forth in section 5.01 or 5.02 would be applicable to such recapitalization event, the adjustments set forth in sections 5.01, 5.02 and 5.03(a) shall be applied in the order in which the events described in such sections occur; provided , however , that no adjustment pursuant to section 5.01, 5.02 or 5.03(a), as applicable, shall be made for an event in connection with such recapitalization event for which an adjustment has already been made. 24 section 5.04. issuer tender offers. if a publicly-announced tender offer made by the company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the common stock shall expire and tendering holders of common stock are paid aggregate consideration having a fair market value, when paid, which exceeds the aggregate fair market value of the common stock acquired in such tender offer as of the last trading date before the date on which such tender offer is first publicly announced (such excess, the &#147; excess tender amount &#148;), then the exercise price in effect immediately after the tender offer expires shall be determined by multiplying (i) the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of the common stock as of the last trading day before the date on which such tender offer is first publicly announced less the premium per pro forma share, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading day before the date on which such tender offer is first publicly announced. as used herein, &#147; premium per pro forma share &#148; means (x) the excess tender amount divided by (y) the number of shares of common stock outstanding at expiration of the tender offer after giving pro forma effect to the purchase of shares in the tender offer. upon any adjustment of the exercise price pursuant to this section 5.04, the total number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be such number of shares (calculated to the nearest hundredth) purchasable per warrant immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the fair market value per share of common stock as of the last trading day before the date on which such tender offer is first publicly announced, and the denominator of which shall be the fair market value per share of the common stock as of the last trading day before the date on which such tender offer is first publicly announced less the premium per pro forma share. section 5.05. consolidation, merger or sale. if any consolidation, merger or similar extraordinary transaction of the company with another person (other than any subsidiary of the company), or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets, other than in any such case a recapitalization event, shall be effected (a &#147; reorganization event &#148;), and in connection with such reorganization event, the common stock shall be converted into or exchanged for or become the right to receive cash, securities or other property, then, as a condition of such reorganization event, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made by the company whereby the holder of each warrant shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive on exercise of such warrant, for an aggregate price equal to the aggregate exercise price for all of the shares underlying the warrant as in effect immediately before such transaction (subject to adjustment thereafter as contemplated by the succeeding sentence), the same kind and amount of cash, securities or other property as it would have had the right to receive if it had exercised such warrant immediately before such transaction and been entitled to participate therein. in the event of any such reorganization event, the company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that applicable provisions of this agreement (including the provisions of article iv and this article v) shall thereafter be binding on the other party to such transaction (or the successor in such transaction) and applicable to any securities thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of warrants. the company will not effect any such reorganization event unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the company) resulting from such reorganization event or the entity purchasing such assets shall assume, by written instrument reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the agent, executed and mailed or delivered to each holder of a warrant at the last address of such holder appearing on the books of the company, the obligation to deliver the cash, securities or property deliverable upon exercise of warrants. the company shall notify the holder of each warrant of any such proposed reorganization event reasonably prior to the consummation thereof so as to provide such holder with a reasonable opportunity prior to such consummation to exercise each warrant in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof; provided , however , that in the case of a transaction which requires notice to be given to the holders of common stock of the company, the holder of each warrant shall be provided the same notice given to the holders of common stock of the company. 25 section 5.06. preemptive rights. upon any issuance for cash of any shares of common stock, rights or options to acquire common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock for cash (in each case, other than issuances that result in adjustments pursuant to section 5.02 or section 5.03), subject to obtaining any required approval of the company&#146;s stockholders to comply with section 312.03 of the new york stock exchange listed company manual, the initial warrant holder and its affiliates, if they still hold at least 50% of the total warrants issued to the initial warrant holder on the issuance date, shall have additional subscription rights allowing the initial warrant holder and its affiliates to maintain their proportionate, as-if-exercised ownership interest in the company based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance. for the avoidance of doubt, obtaining such approval shall be a condition for the company to undertake any issuance subject to this section 5.06. in the event that any issuance subject to this section 5.06 involves a public or rule 144a offering, the initial warrant holder and the company shall negotiate in good faith as to the provision of such subscription rights so as not to materially delay or jeopardize the success of such public offering. the foregoing shall not apply to any issuance of excluded securities. section 5.07. consent upon certain issuances.

(b) subject to sections 9.04(d) and 9.04(f), in connection with each meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected to serve on the board, the company shall take all necessary steps to nominate each ggc appointee (or such alternative persons who are proposed by the initial warrant holder and notified to the company on or prior to any date set forth in the company&#146;s constituent documents or applicable law for board nominees) and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the board to unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the company vote in favor of each ggc appointee for election to the board. if, for any reason, a candidate designated as a ggc appointee is determined to be unqualified to serve on the board because such appointment would constitute a breach of the board&#146;s fiduciary duties or applicable law, the initial warrant holder shall have the right to designate an alternative ggc appointee to be so appointed and the provisions of this section 9.04(b) shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to such alternative ggc appointee. (c) each appointed or elected ggc appointee will hold his or her office as a director of the company for such term as is provided in the company&#146;s constituent documents or until his or her death, resignation or removal from the board or until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the company&#146;s constituent documents and applicable law. if any ggc appointee ceases to serve as a director of the company for any reason during his or her term, the company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the board to fill the vacancy created thereby with a replacement designated by the initial warrant holder. 33 (d) the initial warrant holder shall have the right to designate two ggc appointees (or three ggc appointees if applicable as a result of an increase in the size of the board pursuant to section 9.04(a)) pursuant to sections 9.04(a), 9.04(b) and 9.04(c) until such time as the initial warrant holder has sold 33 1 / 3 % of the underlying stock issuable in respect of the warrants on the issuance date (or warrants exercisable for such percentage of underlying stock), to any person or persons other than affiliates of the initial warrant holder. thereafter, the initial warrant holder shall have the right to designate one ggc appointee (or two ggc appointees if applicable as a result of an increase in the size of the board pursuant to section 9.04(a)) pursuant to sections 9.04(a), 9.04(b) and 9.04(c) until such time as the initial warrant holder has sold 66 2 / 3 % of the underlying stock issuable in respect of the warrants on the issuance date (or warrants exercisable for such percentage of underlying stock), to any person or persons other than affiliates of the initial warrant holder. thereafter, the right of the initial warrant holder to designate a ggc appointee hereunder shall terminate. (e) the company shall provide the same reimbursement of expenses incurred by each ggc appointee, and the same rights and benefits of indemnity to each ggc appointee, as are provided to other non-employee directors on the board; provided that the ggc appointees shall not be provided any retainers, including meeting fees, or other cash compensation or equity compensation for their service on the board or any committee thereof. the company acknowledges that certain directors (including the ggc appointees) may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other sources with respect to such directors&#146; association with the company and its subsidiaries (&#147; other indemnitors &#148;). notwithstanding the existence of any other indemnitor with respect to any director, the company shall be the indemnitor of first resort ( i.e. , the company&#146;s obligations for indemnification and expense advancement to a director are primary and any obligations of any other indemnitor to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by a director are secondary), with respect to any such directors&#146; association with the company and its subsidiaries. the other indemnitors shall be third party beneficiaries of the terms of this section 9.04(e). (f) nothing in this section 9.04 shall prevent the board from acting in accordance with its fiduciary duties or applicable law or from acting in good faith in accordance with its constituent documents, while giving due consideration to the intent of this agreement. the board shall have no obligation to appoint or nominate any ggc appointee upon written notice that such appointment or nomination would violate applicable law or result in a breach by the board of its fiduciary duties to its stockholders; provided , however , that the foregoing shall not affect the right of the initial warrant holder to designate an alternate ggc appointee. 34 section 9.05. stockholder approval. the company shall call a special meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the issuance date (but in any event not later than the first annual meeting of the company&#146;s stockholders to be held after the issuance date) in order to obtain the required stockholder approval. the board shall unanimously recommend to the company&#146;s stockholders that such stockholders approve the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the b-warrants (and, in the case of the a-warrants, the issuance of any excess shares upon exercise of the a-warrants) as set forth herein. in connection with such meeting, the company shall promptly prepare (and the agent and the initial warrant holder will reasonably cooperate with the company to prepare, including by furnishing the company with all reasonably necessary information) and file with the sec a preliminary proxy statement, shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies for such stockholder approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the sec or its staff and to cause a definitive proxy statement related to such stockholders&#146; meeting to be mailed to the company&#146;s stockholders. the company shall notify the agent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the sec or its staff and of any request by the sec or its staff for amendments or supplements to such proxy statement or for additional information and will supply the agent with copies of all correspondence between the company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the sec or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to such proxy statement. in all circumstances, the company shall provide the agent with an opportunity to review, and provide reasonable comments to the company with respect to, any preliminary proxy statement prepared pursuant to this section 9.05 and all supplements and amendments thereto prior to filing of the same with the sec. if at any time prior to such stockholders&#146; meeting there shall occur any event that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement, the company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. each of the agent and the company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it or on its behalf for use in the proxy statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and mail to its stockholders an amendment or supplement to correct such information to the extent required by applicable law. in the event that the required stockholder approval is not obtained at such special meeting, the company shall include a proposal to approve (and the board will unanimously recommend approval of) such issuance and, if any warrants shall have been exercised for series a preferred stock, to approve the conversion of the series a preferred stock into common stock, at a meeting of its stockholders no less than once per each annual period until such approval is obtained (but the company shall not be required to do so more than three times). at each such meeting at which the required stockholder approval is sought, each of the company and the agent and the initial warrant holder (to the extent the agent or the initial warrant holder or any of their affiliates then hold shares of common stock) shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain such required stockholder approval, and the agent and the initial warrant holder shall (to the extent permitted by the rules of the new york stock exchange) vote or cause to be voted any common stock they or their affiliates then hold in favor of such approval and, if requested by the company, shall deliver proxies in respect of such common stock to an agent designated by the company for such purpose. the company shall also call a special meeting of stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable in the event that (i) the company does not have a sufficient number of authorized shares of common stock to issue common stock upon exercise of all unexercised warrants and to effect the conversion of any issued series a preferred stock into common stock, in which case stockholder approval to amend the certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock shall be sought, or (ii) any or all of the warrants are exercised for series a preferred stock, in which case stockholder approval for conversion of the series a preferred stock into common stock shall be sought, in each case in accordance with the voting requirements set forth in the company&#146;s by-laws. in the event of a special meeting called pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence, the company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such stockholder approval and the holders shall (to the extent permitted by the rules of the new york stock exchange) vote any common stock they then hold in favor of such approval. 35 section 9.06. certain other events. if any event occurs as to which the provisions of article v are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not fairly protect the rights of the warrant holders in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the board shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disinterested members of the board, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid. section 9.07. transfers. subject to compliance with applicable federal or state securities laws, common stock and series a preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall be freely transferable;

(b) neither the merger nor consolidation of the company into or with any other company, nor the merger or consolidation of any other company into or with the company, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the assets of the company, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company within the meaning of this section 7.
