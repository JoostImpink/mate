anonyme holding ) organized and existing under the laws of the grand duchy of luxembourg (the &#8220;company&#8221;). the principal executive offices of the issuer are located at 5, rue guillaume kroll, l-1882 luxembourg. &#160; item 2. identity and background. &#160; this statement is being filed by fortis bank s.a./n.v. (&#8220;fortis bank&#8221;), fb transportation capital llc (&#8220;fb transportation&#8221;) and crx acquisition ltd. (&#8220;crx&#8221;) (fortis bank, fb transportation and crx being referred to, collectively, as the &#8220;reporting persons&#8221;). (1) &#160; &#160; fortis bank is a belgian corporation engaged in commercial banking activities. fortis bank is part of the fortis group, an international financial services provider engaged in banking and insurance. fb transportation is a delaware limited liability company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of fortis bank. fb transportation is part of the transportation sector of fortis bank&#8217;s merchant banking group, which provides financial products and services for corporate clients and institutional investors. crx is a bermuda exempted company formed for the purposes of acquiring the assets and assuming the liabilities of the issuer, and following that transaction, will be engaged in the business of managing marine shipping containers acquired from the issuer as well as other marine container assets. crx is currently 100% owned by fb transportation, but it is anticipated that immediately following the closing of the transactions described in item 4 below, fb transportation will own less than 40% of the outstanding common shares of crx. &#160; the principal address of fortis bank is montagne du parc 3, 1000 brussels, belgium. the principal address of fb transportation and crx is 520 madison avenue, 2nd floor, new york, new york 10022. &#160; the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and citizenship of each executive officer and director of fortis bank are set forth in schedule i-a hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and citizenship of each member and executive officer of fb transportation are set forth in schedule i-b hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and citizenship of each executive officer and director of crx are set forth in schedule i-c hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. &#160; during the last five years, none of the reporting persons, nor, to the knowledge of each of the reporting persons, any of the persons listed on schedules i-a, i-b or i-c hereto, (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. &#160; (1) neither the present filing nor anything contained herein shall be construed as an admission that any reporting person constitutes a &#8220;person&#8221; for any purpose other than for compliance with section 13(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;exchange act&#8221;). 1 the reporting persons have entered into a joint filing agreement, dated as of march 12, 2007, a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit 7.01. &#160; item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. &#160; the description of the &#8220;transactions&#8221; set forth in item 4 below is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this item 3. &#160; crx estimates that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the transactions will range between approximately $245.0 million and $260.0 million. of this amount, approximately $11.0 million to $15.0 million cash will be funded by equity contributions to crx by (i) fb transportation, (ii) current members of the senior management team of the issuer and (iii) third-party investors. crx has received equity commitment letters from fb transportation and each member of cronos&#8217; senior management team, under which fb transportation and these individuals have agreed severally to make aggregate capital contributions of up to $11.0 million to crx for common shares of crx. it is currently expected that third-party investors will contribute up to an additional $5.0 million to crx for common shares of crx. the remainder of the total amount necessary to complete the transactions will be the amount that fb transportation pays to purchase the marine container assets and the joint venture interest from crx, as described in item 4 below. from these equity contribution and purchase price sums, crx will repay certain outstanding indebtedness of the issuer and its subsidiaries and will pay certain transaction costs. the source of the cash equity contribution and such purchase price to be paid by fb transportation to crx will be from advances to fb transportation from affiliates of fortis bank. &#160; the amounts described above should be considered approximations only. because the actual amounts of indebtedness outstanding and actual asset values will not be known until on or about the time of the closing of the transactions, these amounts are estimated and are subject to change. &#160; item 4. purpose of transactions. &#160; on february 28, 2007, the issuer entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;assets agreement&#8221;) with fb transportation and crx. the assets agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such agreement, crx will acquire all of the assets of the issuer and assume all of its liabilities (the &#8220;assets sale&#8221;). the purchase price for the assets is approximately $133.7 million. this price was negotiated to enable the issuer to make a distribution in liquidation to its shareholders of $16.00 per share, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes. the closing sales price per share of the common shares of the issuer on the nasdaq global market on february 28, 2007, prior to the public announcement of the assets agreement, was $14.96. &#160; the summary of the assets agreement contained in this item 4 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the assets agreement, which is referenced herein as exhibit 7.02 and incorporated by reference in its entirety into this item 4. &#160; fb transportation has agreed with crx that at the same time as the assets sale, it will purchase from crx substantially all of the marine container assets to be acquired by crx from the issuer and its subsidiaries. in connection with these purchases, fb transportation will also purchase from crx the common shares in cf leasing ltd., a bermuda exempted company that crx will acquire from the issuer as part of the assets sale (&#8220;cf leasing&#8221;). cf leasing is a joint venture that is currently 50%-owned by a subsidiary of the issuer and 50%-owned by fb transportation. cf leasing owns and invests in marine container assets that are currently managed by the issuer and its subsidiaries. the proceeds from these purchases by fb transportation will be applied by crx to pay the purchase price for the assets sale and 2 to assume, repay or refinance indebtedness of the issuer and its subsidiaries outstanding as of the closing date of the assets sale. &#160; the assets sale and its related transactions (including the subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the issuer), the purchase of the owned marine container assets and joint venture interest by fb transportation from crx, and the assumption, repayment and refinancing of indebtedness of the issuer and its subsidiaries, are referred to herein collectively as the &#8220;transactions.&#8221; &#160; following the completion of the transactions, fb transportation and cf leasing would together own substantially all of the marine container assets formerly owned by the issuer and its subsidiaries. crx would manage the leasing activities concerning the marine container assets owned by fb transportation and cf leasing, in addition to other marine container assets owned by third parties. &#160; the closing of the assets sale and related matters will be subject to (i) the consent of certain third parties and (ii) the approval by the issuer&#8217;s shareholders of the assets sale and related matters (including shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation and dissolution) at a shareholder meeting or shareholder meetings to be called and convened by the issuer. &#160; if the assets sale and related matters are consummated, it is expected that the issuer&#8217;s common shares will be delisted from the nasdaq global market and will cease to be registered under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). crx will be privately owned by certain members of the senior management team of the issuer, fb transportation and third-party investors. it is currently anticipated that immediately following the completion of the transactions, fb transportation will own, of record and beneficially, less than 40% of the total outstanding common shares of crx. &#160; in connection with the execution of the assets agreement, on february 28, 2007, crx entered into a support agreement (the &#8220;support agreement&#8221;) with certain director and management shareholders of the issuer and their affiliates (the &#8220;support shareholders&#8221;). the support shareholders are (i) s. nicholas walker (a director of the issuer), (ii) the lion fund limited, york lion fund, l.p. and yorkprop limited (affiliates of mr. walker), (iii) dennis j. tietz (the chief executive officer of the issuer) and (iv) peter j. younger (the president of the issuer). the support agreement obligates the support shareholders to: (i) vote all common shares owned by them in favor of the assets agreement and the transactions contemplated by the assets agreement, (ii) vote against any merger, business combination, or similar transaction (other than the assets sale and the other transactions contemplated by the assets agreement), and (iii) not transfer his or its common shares pending completion of the shareholder meetings to be called to approve the assets sale and the related transactions, or until the earlier termination of the assets agreement. the support shareholders also agreed to grant irrevocable proxies to crx to vote the common shares owned by them, and they agreed that they would not transfer their common shares to third parties or enter into any voting agreement, voting trust or similar arrangement, or grant any other proxies with respect to their shares, except as permitted under the support agreement. the support shareholders own, in the aggregate, approximately 19% of the outstanding common shares of the issuer. &#160; the issuer&#8217;s board of directors also determined that the transactions contemplated by the assets agreement, including the assets sale, represented a &#8220;permitted offer&#8221; under the issuer&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; rights agreement, dated as of october 28, 1999. as a result, any requirement to issue any rights as provided under the rights agreement would not be triggered by the filing of a schedule 13d due to the execution of the support agreement. 3 it is expected that following the closing of the assets sale, (i) peter j. younger, the current president of the issuer, will become the chief executive officer of crx, (ii) frank p. vaughan, the chief financial officer of the issuer, will become the chief financial officer of crx and (iii) john c. kirby, the current senior vice president-operations of the issuer, will serve crx in a similar capacity. in addition, dennis j. tietz, currently the chairman and chief executive officer of the issuer, is expected to become vice-chairman of the board of directors of crx. &#160; messrs. tietz, younger, vaughan and kirby (the &#8220;management shareholders&#8221;) entered into equity commitment letter agreements with crx dated february 28, 2007, to purchase, immediately prior to the closing of the assets sale, for an aggregate amount of $2.0 million cash, a number of common shares of crx that are expected to represent approximately 17% of the total outstanding common shares of crx as of the closing date. the management shareholders may, in their discretion, and at the same per share price, purchase up to an additional $2.0 million of additional common shares of crx. in that event, the management shareholders would be expected to own approximately 34% of the total outstanding common shares of crx as of the closing date. the balance of the common shares of crx would be purchased by fb transportation and by third-party investors, at the same price per share as the management shareholders paid. it is currently expected that immediately following the completion of the transactions, the entire board of directors of crx would (for at least a two-year period) consist of five members: messrs. younger and tietz, two directors to be designated by fb transportation and one director to be designated by the third-party investors. &#160; messrs. tietz and younger have also agreed to enter into employment agreements with crx to be effective at the closing of the assets sale. mr. younger&#8217;s employment agreement will provide that he be granted an award of restricted common shares of crx, to vest over time (or to vest sooner upon a &#8220;change in control&#8221; of crx, crx&#8217;s termination of mr. younger without cause or mr. younger&#8217;s resignation for &#8220;good reason&#8221;). messrs. vaughan&#8217;s and kirby&#8217;s current employment agreements with a subsidiary of the issuer are expected to remain in effect and will not be affected by the assets sale and the related transactions contemplated under the assets agreement. &#160; the assets agreement requires the issuer, subject to certain exceptions: (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice during the period between execution of the assets agreement and closing of the assets sale, and (ii) not to engage in certain transactions outside of the ordinary course of its business during such period. the assets agreement prohibits the issuer from making dividend distributions to its shareholders prior to closing of the assets sale or the earlier termination of the assets agreement, except for: (i) a $0.08 per share dividend declared by the issuer&#8217;s board of directors for the first calendar quarter of 2007, and (ii) if the closing of the assets sale has not occurred by august 15, 2007 at the discretion of the issuer&#8217;s board of directors, a dividend for the third calendar quarter of 2007 that will be consistent with the dividend declared by the issuer&#8217;s board on november 9, 2006. &#160; the obligations of crx and fb transportation under the assets agreement are guaranteed by fortis bank&#8217;s cayman islands branch. &#160; the reporting persons do not plan to acquire additional common shares of the issuer or dispose of any common shares, although they do reserve the right to do so. the assets agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby could result in one or more of the actions specified in clauses (a)-(j) of item 4 of schedule 13d, including the acquisition or disposition of additional securities of the issuer, a merger or other extraordinary transaction involving the issuer, a change to the present board of directors of the issuer, a change to the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer, the delisting of the issuer's securities from the nasdaq global market and the causing of a class of equity securities of the issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the exchange act. 4 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. &#160; (a) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; as of the date hereof, the reporting persons may be deemed to beneficially own 300,000 common shares, representing approximately 3.9% of the common shares outstanding (based on 7,645,673 total outstanding common shares). the common shares are owned by fb aviation &amp; intermodal finance holding b.v., a dutch private limited liability company, and fortis bank (nederland) n.v. , a dutch public limited liability company, both indirect subsidiaries of fortis bank and affiliates of the reporting persons. in 1999, 150,000 of these common shares were issued to fortis bank (nederland) n.v. by the issuer in lieu of restructuring fees in connection with fortis bank&#8217;s participation in a refinancing of the issuer&#8217;s indebtedness at that time. in 2005, fb aviation &amp; intermodal finance holding b.v. acquired 150,000 common shares from another lender-participant in the 1999 refinancing transaction. both transactions were privately-negotiated transactions exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended. fortis bank is also a lender and agent under two credit facilities to cf leasing and to a subsidiary of the issuer for purposes of purchasing marine shipping containers and for general corporate purposes. these facilities are expected to be refinanced prior to, or as part of, the transactions. &#160; as a result of the matters described in item 4 above, the reporting persons may be deemed to constitute a "group," within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the exchange act, with, among others, the management shareholders. the reporting persons do not have affirmative information about any common shares that may be beneficially owned by the management shareholders, other than (i) the 1,458,813 common shares reported as being deemed beneficially owned by s. nicholas walker in an amendment no. 5 to his schedule 13d filed with the sec on march 5, 2007, and (ii) 352,145 common shares (includes 300,000 shares subject to outstanding currently exercisable options) beneficially owned by mr. tietz, 24,950 common shares beneficially owned by mr. younger, 43,000 common shares (includes 35,000 shares subject to outstanding currently exercisable options) beneficially owned by mr. vaughan and 103,000 common shares (includes 95,000 shares subject to outstanding currently exercisable options) beneficially owned by mr. kirby, as reported in the issuer&#8217;s definitive proxy statement for the issuer&#8217;s annual meeting of shareholders held on june 8, 2006 filed with the sec, and statements of changes in beneficial ownership on form 4 for these individuals as filed with the sec. &#160; each reporting person hereby disclaims membership in any "group" with any person other than the reporting persons, and disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock that may be or are beneficially owned by mr. walker, the lion fund limited, york lion fund, l.p., york gp, ltd., york asset management limited, yorkprop limited, mr. tietz, mr. younger, mr. vaughan and mr. kirby. &#160; in accordance with securities and exchange commission release no. 34-39538 (january 12, 1998) (the &#8220;release&#8221;), this filing reflects the securities beneficially owned by certain operating units of the fortis group and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &#8220;fortis reporting units&#8221;). this filing does not reflect securities, if any, beneficially owned by any other operating units of the fortis group whose ownership of securities is disaggregated from that of the fortis reporting units in accordance with the provisions of that release. the fortis reporting units disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities beneficially owned by (i) any client accounts with respect to which the fortis reporting units or their employees have voting or investment discretion, or both, and (ii) certain investment entities of which any of the fortis reporting units acts as manager, to the extent interests in such entities are held by persons other than the fortis reporting units. &#160; (b) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the description set forth in item 5(a) above is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this item 5(b). 5 (c) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; the reporting persons have not effected any transactions in the issuer&#8217;s common shares within the past 60 days. &#160; (d) &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; except for the 300,000 common shares owned by fb aviation &amp; intermodal finance holding b.v. and fortis bank (nederland) n.v., as noted above, and except for any clients of the fortis group who may have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, any common shares held in managed accounts, no other person is known by any of the reporting persons to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, any shares of common shares. &#160;
