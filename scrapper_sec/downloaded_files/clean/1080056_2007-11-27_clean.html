(a) each share of series b preferred stock shall be convertible, without the payment of additional consideration, into a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference by the conversion price.

(c) whenever this section 4 requires one or more certificates representing shares of series b preferred stock to be surrendered to the company, such certificates shall be duly endorsed for transfer (or accompanied by duly endorsed blank stock powers) together with such guarantees and evidence of the authenticity and authority of the signatory as the company may reasonably request; provided , however , that if such certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such shares shall instead deliver to the company an affidavit and indemnity in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the company and, if required by the company, an indemnity bond in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the company. 4.2 adjustment to conversion price for stock splits, etc . if at any time the number of outstanding shares of common stock shall increase by virtue of or in connection with -3- any dividend on the common stock or any stock split or other subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock or a reclassification, then the conversion price shall be adjusted, concurrently with the effectiveness of such increase, to a conversion price that would entitle each holder of series b preferred stock to receive on conversion thereof the same percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock that such holder would have received on conversion thereof immediately prior to such increase. if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of common stock (including, without limitation, pursuant to a reverse stock split), the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such combination or consolidation shall be adjusted, concurrently with the effectiveness of such decrease, to a conversion price that would entitle each holder of series b preferred stock to receive on conversion thereof the same percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock that such holder would have received on conversion thereof immediately prior to such combination or consolidation. 4.3 adjustment for certain transactions . if at any time or from time to time after the date the series b preferred stock is originally issued the company shall be a party to any transaction (other than an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares of common stock by reason of which an adjustment to the conversion price is made under section 4.2), then immediately following consummation of the transaction, and without any action on the part of the holder of any share of series b preferred stock, each holder&#146;s series b preferred stock shall upon conversion and in lieu of the common stock or other securities issuable upon conversion thereof immediately prior to such consummation, convert into the amount of securities, cash or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a stockholder upon the consummation of the transaction if such holder had converted those shares of series b preferred stock immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to such other securities or property by the terms thereof. in any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this section 4.3 with respect to the rights of the holders of series b preferred stock after such transaction so that the provisions of this section 4.3 shall be applicable after the transaction and be as nearly equivalent as practicable. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the transaction is approved by both (x) the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the series b preferred stock, voting as a single class, and (y) a vote sufficient under the delaware general corporation law, the company&#146;s certificate of incorporation (as in effect at the time of such vote) and the company&#146;s bylaws (as in effect at the time of such vote), then the rights of the holders of series b preferred stock in connection with such transaction will be governed by the documents to be entered into in connection with such transaction. 4.4 report or certificate as to adjustments . in each case of any adjustment or readjustment pursuant to section 4.2 or 4.3, the company at its expense will promptly prepare a certificate of its chief financial officer showing in reasonable detail the computation of such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of this certificate of designation. the company will forthwith send a copy of each such report to each holder of series b preferred stock, and will, upon the written request at any time of a holder, furnish to such holder a like report setting forth the conversion price at the time in effect and showing how it was calculated. -4- 4.5 optional conversion . (a) any holder of shares of series b preferred stock may, at any time, convert such stock, in whole or in part, by making written demand for such conversion (an &#147;optional conversion demand&#148; ) upon the company at its principal executive offices setting forth therein: (i) the number of shares of series b preferred stock to be converted; and (ii) the proposed date of such conversion, which shall be the business day after such optional conversion demand is actually received by the company (the &#147;optional conversion date&#148; ); provided , however , in the event such optional conversion demand is actually received by the company prior to 10 a.m. (new york time), the optional conversion date shall be the date of such receipt. such demand shall be accompanied by one or more certificates representing the shares to be converted. thererafter, within three business days after the optional conversion date, the company shall issue and deliver to such holder one or more certificates for the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof. (b) if a conversion is in connection with a bona fide public offering of shares of common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act or under similar laws of other jurisdictions (a &#147;public offering&#148; ), the conversion shall be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of common stock pursuant to such public offering, and the conversion shall not be deemed to have occurred until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of common stock. (c) upon surrender of certificates of series b preferred stock to be converted in part, the company shall issue a balance certificate representing the number of full shares of series b preferred stock not so converted. 4.6 mandatory conversion . (a) upon a mandatory conversion event, all of the series b preferred stock shall be automatically converted as of the mandatory conversion date in respect of such conversion.
