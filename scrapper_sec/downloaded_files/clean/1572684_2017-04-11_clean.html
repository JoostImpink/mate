stock&#148;), of the issuer, providing pico with no economic rights but entitling pico, without regard to the number of shares of class b common stock held by it, to one vote for each series a unit of ucp, llc held by it, with respect to matters presented to the stockholders of the issuer. as of march 31, 2017, pico held 10,593,000 series a units of ucp, llc (which are exchangeable for 10,401,722 shares of class a common stock) and 100 shares of class b common stock of the issuer (such securities, together with all other shares of capital stock of the issuer acquired by pico and its affiliates from and after the date of the voting agreement, being referred to as the &#147;pico shares&#148;), which provided pico with approximately 57% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. 4 pursuant to the voting agreement, pico has agreed (i) to appear and be present at all meetings of the issuer&#146;s stockholders and otherwise cause all pico shares to be counted for purposes of determining a quorum, and (ii) to (a) affirmatively vote and cause to be voted all pico shares in favor of (&#147;for&#148;), or, if action is to be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting of the issuer&#146;s stockholders, deliver to the issuer a duly executed affirmative written consent in favor of (&#147;for&#148;), the adoption of the merger agreement by the issuer&#146;s stockholders and approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated under the merger agreement; and (b) vote and cause to be voted all pico shares against, and not provide any written consent with respect to or for, the adoption or approval of (1) any company takeover proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) and the transactions contemplated thereby, (2) any action or agreement (including, without limitation, any amendment of any agreement to which the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer is a party or to which any assets or properties of the issuer or any company subsidiary is subject or bound) that pico knows, or would reasonably be expected to know, would result in (x) a breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or other obligation of the issuer or any subsidiary or affiliate of the issuer set forth in the merger agreement, or (y) the failure of any of the conditions to the obligations of the reporting person or merger sub to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated under the merger agreement set forth in sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the merger agreement, (3) any change in the size, term in office, or composition of the board of directors of the issuer, and (4) any agreement (including, without limitation, any amendment, waiver, release from, or non-enforcement of any agreement), any amendment or restatement of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the issuer, or any other action (or failure to act) that is intended or would reasonably be expected to prevent, interfere with, or materially impair or delay, the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated under the merger agreement in accordance with their terms. furthermore, as part of the voting agreement, and as security for and in furtherance of the agreements described in the preceding paragraph, to the extent that pico fails to comply with any of its voting and other obligations as to voting pursuant to the voting agreement, pico has irrevocably granted to, constituted and appointed the reporting person and each of the executive officers of the reporting person, in their respective capacities as executive officers of the reporting person, as the case may be, as pico&#146;s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of pico, to vote all pico shares that are owned beneficially and/or held of record by pico and its affiliates on the date of the voting agreement and, from time to time, with full and unconditional authority to grant or withhold a consent or approval in respect of such pico shares and to execute and deliver a proxy (or proxies) to vote such pico shares at each meeting of the stockholders of the issuer convened in respect of the matters set forth in the preceding paragraph. the proxy granted pursuant to the voting agreement shall be deemed to be a proxy coupled with an interest, is irrevocable (subject to the termination of the voting agreement), and shall not be terminated by operation of law or upon the occurrence of any other event. accordingly, because of the rights and benefits afforded to the reporting person under voting agreement, the reporting person may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 10,401,722 shares of class a common stock (including any shares of capital stock of the issuer acquired by pico after the date of the voting agreement). the voting agreement terminates automatically on the first to occur of (i) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, and (ii) the effective time. notwithstanding the foregoing, if a company recommendation change (as defined in the merger agreement) is made by the board of directors of the issuer in response to an intervening event (as defined in the merger agreement), and the reporting person does not exercise its unilateral right to terminate the merger agreement, pico&#146;s voting obligations and the proxy granted by pico pursuant to the voting agreement as described in the preceding paragraphs will no longer be in respect of all pico shares, but, in lieu and instead thereof, will be in respect of that number of pico shares equal to 28% of the aggregate voting power attributable to all outstanding shares of capital stock of the issuer. a copy of the voting agreement is filed as exhibit 2 to this schedule 13d and incorporated herein by reference. the foregoing description of the voting agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the compete terms of the voting agreement. except as contemplated by the merger agreement, the voting agreement or as otherwise set forth in
