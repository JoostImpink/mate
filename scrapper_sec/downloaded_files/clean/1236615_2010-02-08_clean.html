2.9&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;other dilutive events.&#160;&#160;in case any event shall occur as to which the provisions of this section 2 are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment would not fairly protect the purchase rights represented by the warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then, in each such case, the company shall make a good faith adjustment to the number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant in accordance with the intent of this section 2 and, upon the written request of the registered holders of a majority in interest of the warrants, shall appoint a firm of independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing (which may be the regular auditors of the company), which shall give its opinion upon the adjustment, if any, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in this section 2, necessary to preserve, without dilution, the purchase rights represented by these warrants.&#160;&#160;upon receipt of such opinion, the company shall promptly mail a copy thereof to the registered holder of each warrant and shall make the adjustments described therein. &#160;
