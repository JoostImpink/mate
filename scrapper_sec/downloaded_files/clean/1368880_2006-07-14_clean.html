(e) to the extent the foregoing indemnity is held by a court to be unavailable for reasons of public policy in the united states to hold harmless an indemnified party under sections 5.9(a), (b) or (c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or cusip no. 62941w101 schedule 13d page 46 of 55 payable by such indemnified party as a result of any claim in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such offering of securities. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. if, however, the allocation provided in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 5.9(e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this section 5.9(e). the amount paid or payable in respect of any claim shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. each holder&#146;s obligation to contribute pursuant to this subsection (e) shall not exceed the product of (i) the number of shares sold by such holder in such registration and (ii) the public offering price of such shares as set forth in the applicable prospectus. (f) the indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of the registrable securities by any such party.
