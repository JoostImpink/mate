(c) priority on demand registration. all registrable securities requested to be included in the demand registration shall be included unless the offering is to be underwritten and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that all of the registrable securities requested to be included may not be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering. in such case, the number of such registrable securities included in the offering, if any, shall be allocated first, pro rata among the former senior noteholders on the basis of the total number of registrable securities requested by each such holder to be included and second, pro rata among the other holders of registrable securities requested to be included pursuant to section 4.2 on the basis of the total number of registrable securities requested to be included pursuant to section 4.2. if all registrable securities requested to be included in the demand registration are so included, the corporation may include in the demand registration other securities to be sold by the corporation for its own account or to be sold by other persons, unless the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of such other securities will cause the number of registrable securities and other securities requested to be included in the offering to exceed the number which may be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering. (d) restrictions on demand registration. the corporation shall not be obligated to effect a demand registration within 120 days after the effective date of a previous registration of securities by the corporation under the securities act if the holders of registrable securities were given piggyback rights in such previous registration pursuant to section 4.2 and all registrable securities requested to be included in such registration pursuant to section 4.2 were included therein. the corporation shall be entitled to postpone, for up to 90 days (or for up to 120 days if the demand request relating to the registration statement is received during the month of december or the first quarter of any calendar year) the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant hereto if, at the time it receives a demand request, the corporation would be required to prepare for inclusion or incorporation into the registration statement any financial - 7 - 8 statements other than those that it customarily prepares or the corporation determines in its reasonable business judgment that such registration and offering would materially interfere with any financing, refinancing, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other material corporate transactions or development involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries and promptly gives the holders of the registrable securities making the demand request written notice of such determination; provided, that if the corporation shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, the holders of a majority of the registrable securities making the demand request shall have the right to withdraw the demand request by giving written notice to the corporation within 30 days after the receipt of notice of postponement and, in the event of such withdrawal, the withdrawn demand request shall be deemed not to have been made and shall not count as a demand registration. (e) selection of underwriters. the corporation shall have the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer the demand registration, subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be included therein, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(a) right to piggyback. whenever the corporation proposes to register any of its equity securities under the securities act (including, without limitation, in a demand registration) and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of registrable securities, the corporation shall give prompt written notice to each holder of registrable securities of its intention to effect such a registration and shall include in such registration (a "piggyback registration") all registrable securities with respect to which the corporation has received written requests for inclusion therein (which request shall state the - 8 - 9 intended method of distribution thereof) within 30 days after the receipt of the corporation's notice on the same terms and conditions as the other securities included therein. (b) piggyback expenses. the registration expenses of the holders of registrable securities shall be paid by the corporation in all piggyback registrations. (c) priority on primary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the corporation, and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the corporation shall include in such registration first, the securities the corporation proposes to sell and second, the registrable securities requested to be included therein and then (and only then) any other securities requested to be included in such registration. if less than all the registrable securities requested to be included in the piggyback registration may be so included, the number of registrable securities included in the piggyback registration shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of registrable securities on the basis of the number of registrable securities requested by each such holder to be included therein. (d) priority on secondary registrations. if a piggyback registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of other holders of the corporation's securities other than a demand registration, and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the corporation shall include in such registration the registrable securities and the other securities on whose behalf the registration was initially being made pro rata among the holders of the registrable securities and the holders of such other securities on the basis of the number of registrable securities and other securities requested by each such holder to be included therein. if the piggyback registration is a demand registration and the managing underwriters advise the corporation in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the provisions of section 4.1(c) shall govern. (e) continued obligation for demand registration. no registration of registrable securities effected under this section 4.2 shall relieve the corporation of its obligation to effect registration of the registrable - 9 - 10 securities upon any demand request made pursuant to the provisions of section 4.1. (f) withdrawal or delay. if at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the corporation shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the corporation may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each holder of registrable securities requested to be included in such offering and (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any registrable securities in connection with such registration (but not from any obligation of the corporation to pay the registration expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holder of registrable securities to include registrable securities in any future registrations pursuant to this section 4.2 or to cause a registration to be effected as a demand registration under section 4.1, and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any registrable securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. 4.3 holdback agreements. (a) no holder of registrable securities shall effect any public sale or distribution (which shall not include any sales pursuant to rule 144 or 144a) of equity securities of the corporation, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the seven days prior to and the 120-day period following the effective date of the registration statement for a demand registration or any underwritten piggyback registration in which registrable securities are or may be included (except as part of the offering covered by such registration statement) unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree. (b) the corporation shall not effect any public sale or distribution of shares of common stock or any other equity securities of the corporation, during the seven days prior to and during the 90-day period following the effective date of any underwritten demand registration or any underwritten piggyback registration (except as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registrations on form s-8 or any successor form or pursuant to any shelf registration statement then in effect for the benefit of any holders of the corporation's securities), unless the underwriters managing the registered public offering otherwise agree. 4.4 registration procedures. whenever any registrable securities are required to be registered pursuant to this agreement, the corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such registrable securities in accordance with the - 10 - 11 intended method of disposition thereof and pursuant thereto the corporation shall as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such registrable securities on form s-1 or such other form of general applicability satisfactory to the managing underwriter (or if the offering is not underwritten, the holders of a majority of registrable securities included therein) and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective (provided that the corporation may delay or discontinue any registration statement effected under section 4.1 in accordance with section 4.1(d) or section 4.2 in accordance with section 4.2(f)) and prepare and file with the sec such amendments and post-effective amendments to such registration statement and supplements to the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective under the securities act and the blue sky laws of any applicable state for a period of not less than 90 days in the case of an underwritten offering, and in any other offering, until the disposition of all registrable securities covered by such registration statement, but not longer than a period of six months, unless at the expiration of such six month period, less than 75% of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold, then such period shall automatically be extended for six additional months; provided that at any time after the registration statement has been continuously effective for six consecutive months, if the corporation determines in its reasonable business judgment that having such registration statement remain in effect would materially interfere with any financing, refinancing, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other material corporate transaction or development involving the corporation or any of its subsidiaries or at any time after such registration statement has been declared effective if the corporation becomes the subject of an unsolicited tender offer for at least a majority of its equity securities, the corporation may, upon prior written notice to each holder of registrable securities included therein, suspend such registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days, and in no event shall the corporation be entitled to exercise such right more than once in any 12-month period;

(b) in connection with any registration statement in which a holder of registrable securities is participating, each such holder shall indemnify the corporation, its managers, officers and employees and each person who controls the corporation (within the meaning of the securities act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including legal expenses and any expenses incurred in investigating any claims) resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such holder specifically stating that it is to be used in the preparation thereof; provided that the obligation to indemnify shall be individual to each holder and in no event shall the aggregate liability of a holder for indemnities pursuant to this section 4.7 exceed the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of its registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement. (c) any person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "indemnified party") shall (i) give prompt written notice to any person obligated to make such indemnification (an "indemnifying party") of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. if such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). an indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such - 18 - 19 indemnified parties with respect to such claim or that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. (d) in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability in any case in which either (i) the indemnity provided for in this section 4.7 is unavailable to a party that would otherwise have been an indemnified party, or (ii) contribution under the securities act or any other applicable law may be required on the part of any such holder of registrable securities or any controlling person of such a holder in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section 4.7; then, and in each such case, the indemnifying and indemnified party will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statement or omission or circumstance which resulted in such loss, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case, (a) no such holder will be ------- required to contribute any amount in excess of the amounts received by it from the sale of its registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement; and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
