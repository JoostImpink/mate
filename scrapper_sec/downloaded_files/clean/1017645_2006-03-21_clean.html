--------------------------- --------------------------- page 18 of 24 - --------------------------- --------------------------- recommend that its stockholders elect to the board of directors, a nominee designated by the ga purchasers (who initially was william e. ford); and (iv) the ga purchasers agreed to the standstill provisions described below. the standstill prohibits the ga purchasers from engaging in certain activities, including (i) acquiring, announcing an intention to acquire, offering to acquire or entering into any agreement, arrangement or undertaking to acquire, by purchase, exchange or otherwise, any shares of capital stock of the company if the acquisition would result in the ga purchasers, together with any investment entity that is an affiliate of the ga purchasers, owning more than 20% of the voting power of the company; (ii) until the standstill period expires on march 14, 2011, proposing or announcing an intention to propose any sale transaction involving the company without the prior approval of the company's board of directors; or (iii) until the standstill period expires on march 14, 2011, without the prior approval of the company's board of directors, soliciting stockholders to nominate any person for election as a director or seeking the removal or resignation of any director, except for the one director designated by the ga purchasers, or otherwise seek to control the board of directors or the management of the company. on the closing date, the company and the ga purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of march 14, 2006 (the "registration rights agreement"), pursuant to which (i) at any time following 180 days after the completion of the company's initial public offering, the ga purchasers, as a group, will have two "demand" registration rights for an underwritten offering; (ii) at any time following 180 days after the completion of the company's initial public offering, the ga purchasers, as a group, will have customary "piggyback" registration rights, pursuant to which they may -
