&#160; item 5. &#160; &#160; interest in securities of issuer. &#160; &#160; as discussed in item 4 above, the reporting persons have agreed to aggregate their voting power pursuant to the stockholder agreement. as a result of the stockholder agreement, each reporting person may be deemed to have beneficial ownership (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the securities exchange act, as amended) of, and shared power to vote or direct the vote of 10,642,565 shares of common stock, which represents 50.6404% of the outstanding shares thereof. each reporting person executed an irrevocable proxy in connection with the stockholder agreement and appointed james p. shoen as proxy in order to carry out the terms of the stockholder agreement. in addition, any shares of common stock acquired by or issued to any party to the stockholder agreement shall be subject to the terms of the stockholder agreement. &#160; &#160; while the reporting persons share voting power, each reporting person retains the sole dispositive power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by such reporting person. &#160; &#160; edward j. shoen beneficially owns 3,487,944 shares of common stock and retains sole dispositive power over such shares. such shares constitute approximately 16.60% of the outstanding common stock. &#160; &#160; mark v. shoen beneficially owns 3,529,669 shares of common stock and retains sole dispositive power over such shares. such shares constitute approximately 16.80% of the outstanding common stock. &#160; &#160; james p. shoen beneficially owns 1,950,229 shares of common stock and retains sole dispositive power over such shares. such shares constitute approximately 9.27% of the outstanding common stock. &#160;

&#160; other than the purchase by mark v. shoen (through blackwater) of 100,000 shares of common stock and the sale of such shares by james p. shoen (through jps partners), which is described in item 3 above, none of the reporting persons have effected any transaction in the company&#8217;s common stock during the past sixty (60) days. &#160; &#160; item 6. &#160; contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. &#160; &#160; as discussed in item 4 above, the reporting persons entered into the stockholder agreement, pursuant to which each party agreed to (i) vote as one block consistent with the terms of the stockholder agreement and (ii) grant an irrevocable proxy to james p. shoen to vote each reporting person&#8217;s share pursuant to the terms set forth in the stockholder agreement. &#160;
