together with the &#147;governance agreement,&#148; the &#147;agreements&#148;). the following is a summary of the material terms of the agreements. the following summary descriptions do not purport to cover all the provisions of the agreements, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements, which are filed as exhibits 2 and 3 hereto, and incorporated into this report by reference. the governance agreement representation of liberty on the tripadvisor board of directors under the terms of the governance agreement: &#149; liberty has the right to nominate up to such number of tripadvisor directors as is equal to 20% of the total number of tripadvisor directors (rounded up to the next whole number if the total number of directors is not an even multiple of 5) so long as liberty beneficially owns at least 16,825,982 equity securities of tripadvisor (so long as liberty&#146;s ownership percentage is at least equal to 15% of the total equity securities of tripadvisor) &#149; liberty has the right to nominate one director of tripadvisor so long as liberty beneficially owns at least 11,217,321 equity securities of tripadvisor (so long as liberty owns at least 5% of the total equity securities of tripadvisor); and &#149; tripadvisor will use its reasonable best efforts to cause one of liberty&#146;s designees to be a member of a committee of the board of directors of tripadvisor and, to the extent the person designated by liberty would qualify as a member of the compensation committee of the board of directors of tripadvisor under applicable tax and securities laws and regulations, tripadvisor will seek to have that person appointed to the compensation committee of tripadvisor. -7- pursuant to the terms of the governance agreement, tripadvisor will cause each director that liberty nominates to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the board of directors of tripadvisor to the stockholders of tripadvisor for election as directors at each annual meeting of the stockholders of tripadvisor and will use all reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such director including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such persons. liberty has the right to designate a replacement director to the board of tripadvisor in order to fill any vacancy of a director previously designated by liberty. liberty would have the right to transfer this ability to nominate candidates to the board of tripadvisor, subject to the same ownership requirements as liberty&#146;s current nomination rights, to its transferee in a block sale (as discussed below), provided that the transferee&#146;s nominees are independent directors and are approved by tripadvisor&#146;s nominating committee (or equivalent committee of the board of tripadvisor). in addition, as described below under &#147;the stockholders agreement&#151;distribution transactions,&#148; the spun-off or split-off company in a distribution transaction will succeed to liberty&#146;s rights under the governance agreement, including liberty&#146;s right to nominate directors. contingent matters the governance agreement lists certain actions that require the prior consent of liberty and mr. diller before tripadvisor can take any such action, which are referred to herein as &#147;contingent matters&#148;. for so long as: &#149; in the case of liberty, liberty owns at least 14,956,428 equity securities and at least 5% of the total equity securities of tripadvisor (the &#147;liberty condition&#148;); and &#149; in the case of mr. diller, he owns at least 2,500,000 common shares (including options to purchase common shares, whether or not then exercisable), continues to serve as chairman of tripadvisor and has not become disabled (the &#147;diller condition,&#148; and together with the liberty condition, the &#147;consent conditions&#148;), tripadvisor has agreed that, without the prior approval of liberty and/or mr. diller, as applicable, it will not engage in any transaction that would result in liberty or mr. diller having to divest any part of their interests in tripadvisor or any other material assets, or that would render any such ownership illegal or would subject mr. diller or liberty to any fines, penalties or material additional restrictions or limitations. -8- in addition, for so long as the consent conditions apply, if tripadvisor (or any of its subsidiaries) incurs any indebtedness (other than a customary refinancing not to exceed the principal amount of the existing obligation being refinanced) after which tripadvisor&#146;s &#147;total debt ratio&#148; (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds 8:1, then for so long as the total debt ratio continues to equal or exceed 8:1, tripadvisor may not take any of the following actions without the prior approval of liberty and/or mr. diller: &#149; acquire or dispose of any assets, issue any debt or equity securities, repurchase any debt or equity securities, or incur indebtedness, if the aggregate value of such transaction or transactions (alone or in combination) during any six month period equals 10% or more of tripadvisor&#146;s market capitalization; &#149; voluntarily commence any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of tripadvisor or any material subsidiary of tripadvisor; &#149; make any material amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of tripadvisor; &#149; engage in any line of business other than online and offline travel media and related businesses, or other businesses engaged in by tripadvisor as of the date of determination of the total debt ratio; &#149; adopt any stockholder rights plan that would adversely affect liberty or mr. diller, as applicable; or &#149; grant additional consent rights to a stockholder of tripadvisor. preemptive rights in the event that tripadvisor issues or proposes to issue any shares of common stock or class b common stock (with certain limited exceptions) including shares issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants and convertible securities, liberty will have preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of common shares so that liberty will maintain the identical ownership interest in tripadvisor (subject to certain adjustments) that liberty had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). any purchase by liberty will be allocated between common stock and class b common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that liberty opts to acquire shares of common stock in lieu of shares of class b common stock. registration rights liberty and mr. diller are entitled to customary, transferable registration rights with respect to shares of common stock owned by them. liberty is entitled to four demand registration rights and mr. diller is entitled to three demand registration rights. tripadvisor will pay the costs associated with such registrations (other than underwriting discounts, fees and commissions). tripadvisor will not be required to register shares of its common stock if a stockholder could sell the shares in the quantities proposed to be sold at such time in one transaction under rule 144 of the securities act or under another comparable exemption from registration. in connection with a transfer of tripadvisor securities to an unaffiliated third party, liberty or mr. diller may assign any of its or his then-remaining demand registration rights to the third party transferee, if upon the transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of -9- more than 5% of the outstanding equity securities of tripadvisor. if upon the transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of equity securities of tripadvisor representing less than 5% of the outstanding equity securities, but having at least $250 million in then-current market value, liberty or mr. diller may assign one of its or his remaining demand registration rights, which the transferee may exercise only in connection with an offering of shares of common stock having $100 million or more in market value. inapplicability of anti-takeover provisions to distribution transaction or block sale pursuant to the governance agreement, tripadvisor will not, in the case of a distribution transaction (as discussed below), implement any anti-takeover provision (including any shareholder rights plan) or, in the case of a block sale (as discussed below), will render inapplicable any such anti-takeover provision: &#149; the purpose or reasonably evident effect of which is to restrict or limit liberty&#146;s ability to engage in a distribution transaction or a block sale; or &#149; the purpose or reasonably evident effect of which is to impose a material economic detriment on the company to which tripadvisor equity securities are transferred in connection with a qualifying distribution transaction (and whose shares are distributed to the public stockholders of liberty) or that would impose a material economic detriment on the transferee in a block sale. in addition, the tripadvisor board will approve the transfer of common shares in a distribution transaction or block sale (up to a 30% ownership level in the case of a block sale) for purposes of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (&#147;dgcl&#148;), which is the prohibition on transactions with interested stockholders under delaware state law. in the case of a block sale, however, such approval for purposes of section 203 of the dgcl will be subject to the imposition of contractual restrictions on the block sale transferee analogous to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl (as further described below). restrictions on block sale transferee for three years following a block sale by liberty, the transferee will be subject to the following restrictions with regard to tripadvisor, unless the restrictions terminate early in the circumstances discussed below: &#149; an ownership cap set at 30% of the total equity securities of tripadvisor (which would apply to any &#147;group&#148; of which the transferee or its affiliates is a member), subject to adjustment under certain circumstances; &#149; specified &#147;standstill&#148; restrictions limiting the transferee&#146;s ability, at such time as any directors nominated by the transferee are serving on the tripadvisor board, to, among other things, engage in proxy contests, propose transactions involving the company, form a &#147;group&#148; (as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934) or influence the management of tripadvisor. these restrictions, other than the prohibition on proxy contests, would terminate if the transferee relinquishes all rights to nominate directors under the governance agreement; and -10- &#149; contractual provisions analogous to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl that would prohibit the transferee from engaging in specified &#147;business combination&#148; transactions with tripadvisor without the prior approval by tripadvisor, acting through a committee of independent directors. the contractual provisions mirroring section 203 of the dgcl would not apply to the transferee if upon the block sale it would not be an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; (as determined pursuant to section 203 of the dgcl) of tripadvisor. however, if these contractual provisions become applicable at the time of the block sale, they will continue in effect for the term of the standstill restrictions even if the transferee would subsequently cease to qualify as an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; (as determined pursuant to section 203 of the dgcl). the standstill restrictions and 30% ownership cap, as well as the termination provisions, would apply to subsequent transferees of all or substantially all of the shares transferred in a prior block sale, but in any event would not extend past the third anniversary of the original block sale. with respect to such unaffiliated subsequent transferees of the shares transferred in a prior block sale, the statutory (rather than contractual) anti-takeover restrictions of section 203 of the dgcl would apply subject to the waiver, at the time of a transfer, by tripadvisor. prior to the expiration of the three year term, the standstill restrictions, including the cap on ownership described above, would terminate at the earlier of (i) mr. diller and his affiliates &#147;actually owning&#148; securities representing more than 50% of the total voting power of tripadvisor or (ii) the block sale transferee and its affiliates beneficially owning (as defined in the governance agreement) securities representing less than 12% of the total voting power of tripadvisor and mr. diller beneficially owning (as defined in the governance agreement) securities representing more than 40% of the total voting power of tripadvisor. for this purpose, securities &#147;actually owned&#148; by mr. diller and his affiliates will include all securities of tripadvisor held by mr. diller and his &#147;affiliates&#148;, plus those shares of class b common stock for which mr. diller and his &#147;affiliates&#148; have a right to &#147;swap&#148; shares of common stock (as discussed below) but for which the swap right has not been exercised, minus the securities mr. diller and his &#147;affiliates&#148; currently hold but would need to exchange for the class b common stock in such swap right. the above restrictions may be waived at any time by tripadvisor, acting through a committee of independent directors. other block sale provisions any block sale by liberty within the two years immediately following the completion of the spin-off will require the consent of expedia and tripadvisor. expedia and tripadvisor will not withhold their consent to such block sale if they determine in good faith (a) that a safe harbor exists for the block sale under section 355(e) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or (b) that during the two years immediately prior to the spin-off there were no substantial negotiations with the transferee in such block sale regarding the block sale. -11- if mr. diller does not acquire from liberty all shares of class b common stock proposed to be transferred in a block sale or in a transfer of all of the class b common stock and common stock beneficially owned by liberty through the exercise of his &#147;swap&#148; rights or right of first refusal under the stockholders agreement (resulting in such class b common stock of liberty being converted into, or exchanged for, shares of common stock before the block sale), for a period of two years after the block sale, mr. diller will have the right from time to time to acquire from tripadvisor an equal number of shares of class b common stock held in treasury, either by purchase at fair market value, through an exchange of an equivalent number of shares of common stock, or a combination thereof. mr. diller may exercise this right either alone or in conjunction with one or more third-parties so long as mr. diller retains voting control over the class b common stock acquired. prior to the two year period following a block sale, mr. diller&#146;s right to acquire class b common stock from tripadvisor will be suspended immediately upon the entry by tripadvisor into a merger agreement providing for a merger that constitutes a change of control of tripadvisor, and will terminate irrevocably upon the consummation of a tender or exchange offer for securities representing a majority of the total voting power of tripadvisor or a merger that constitutes a change of control of tripadvisor. certain waivers during the term of the stockholders agreement, without tripadvisor&#146;s consent (to be exercised by a committee of independent directors), mr. diller will not waive liberty&#146;s obligation under the stockholders agreement to convert or exchange its shares of class b common stock to shares of common stock in specified circumstances. this consent right is not applicable if mr. diller no longer has any rights under the stockholders agreement. in certain circumstances this consent right will survive a mutual termination of the stockholders agreement for a period of up to one year. termination generally, the governance agreement will terminate: &#149; with respect to liberty, at such time that liberty beneficially owns equity securities representing less than 5% of the total equity securities of tripadvisor; and &#149; with respect to mr. diller, at such time as mr. diller ceases to be the chairman of tripadvisor or becomes disabled. with respect to the provisions governing &#147;contingent matters,&#148;

(a) if, after compliance with section 4.4, either diller or liberty shall desire to transfer to any unaffiliated - 9 - third party any of the class b common stock beneficially owned by him or it or any member of his or its stockholder group (other than a transfer to a qualified distribution transferee), in one transaction or a series of related transactions (the &#147; tag-along sale &#148;), diller or liberty, as applicable (the &#147; initiating party ), shall give prior written notice to the other (the &#147; tag party &#148;) of such intended transfer. such notice (the &#147; tag-along notice &#148;) shall set forth the terms and conditions of such proposed transfer, including the number of shares of class b common stock proposed to be transferred (the &#147; tag-along shares &#148;), the purchase price per share of class b common stock proposed to be paid therefor and the payment terms and type of transfer to be effectuated.

(c) at the closing of any proposed transfer in respect of which a tag-along notice has been delivered, the tag party shall deliver, free and clear of all liens (other than liens caused by the acquiring person in the tag-along sale), to such third party certificates evidencing the shares of class b common stock to be sold thereto duly endorsed with transfer powers and shall receive in exchange therefore the consideration to be paid by such third party in respect of such shares of class b common stock as described in the tag-along notice. (d) neither diller and the members of his stockholder group, on the one hand, nor liberty and the members of its stockholder group, on the other hand, shall effect any transfer or transfers constituting a tag-along sale absent compliance with this section 4.2. (e) upon written request made from time to time by liberty, diller will use reasonable efforts to cause the company to deliver to liberty and diller a written statement specifying the number of shares of common stock, class b common stock and other voting securities issued and outstanding as of the most recent practicable date. liberty and diller will, in connection with any applicable calculations hereunder or under the governance agreement, be entitled to rely upon the information set forth in such statement. in the event such statement is not delivered to liberty within five business days following liberty&#146;s request therefor, liberty and diller (and their respective successors and permitted assigns) shall be entitled to rely - 10 - for purposes of such calculations on the number of shares of common stock, class b common stock and other voting securities listed as issued and outstanding in the company&#146;s most recent quarterly or annual report publicly filed with the commission or the most recent statement from the company. section 4.3. right of first refusal between liberty and diller . (a) any transfer of shares of class b common stock by a member of the liberty stockholder group or a member of the diller stockholder group (the &#147; l/d transferring party &#148;) will be subject to the right of first refusal provisions of this section 4.3, other than a transfer by a member of the liberty stockholder group or the diller stockholder group permitted by section 4.1(a) hereof, including, for the avoidance of doubt, a transfer to a qualified distribution transferee. (b) prior to effecting any transfer subject to section 4.3(a), the l/d transferring party shall deliver written notice (the &#147; l/d offer notice &#148;) to diller, if the l/d transferring party is a member of the liberty stockholder group, or to liberty, if the l/d transferring party is a member of the diller stockholder group (the recipient of such notice, the &#147; l/d other party &#148;), which l/d offer notice shall specify (i) the person to whom the l/d transferring party proposes to make such transfer, (ii) the number or amount of the shares of class b common stock to be transferred, (iii) the l/d offer price (as defined below), and (iv) all other material terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including a description of any non-cash consideration sufficiently detailed to permit valuation thereof, and which l/d offer notice shall be accompanied by any written offer from the prospective transferee to purchase such shares of class b common stock, if available and permitted pursuant to the terms thereof. the l/d offer notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to the l/d other party, for the period of time described below, to purchase all (but not less than all) of such shares of class b common stock. (c) for purposes of this section 4.3, &#147; l/d offer price &#148; shall mean the purchase price per share of class b common stock to be paid to the l/d transferring party in the proposed transaction (as it may be adjusted in order to determine the net economic value thereof). in the event that the consideration payable to the l/d transferring party in a proposed transaction consists of securities, the purchase price per share shall equal the fair market value of such securities divided by the number of shares of class b common stock to be transferred. such fair market value shall be the market price of any publicly traded security and, if such security is not publicly traded, the fair market value shall be equal to the fair market value of such security determined as follows: each of liberty and diller shall select an independent investment banking firm each of which shall promptly make a determination (each such determination, an &#147; appraisal &#148;) of the fair market value of such security. if the higher of such appraisals is less than or equal to 110% of the lower of such appraisals, then the fair market value shall be equal to the average of such appraisals. if the higher of such appraisals is greater than 110% of the lower of such appraisals, then a third independent investment banking firm (which shall be an independent investment banking firm that shall not have been engaged by the company, expedia (but only for so long as diller is the senior executive of expedia), iac/interactivecorp (but only for so long as diller is the senior executive of iac/interactivecorp), liberty or diller in any significant matter for the three years prior to the date of such selection) shall be selected by the first two independent investment banking firms, which third independent investment banking firm shall promptly make a determination of the fair market value. the fair market value shall equal the average of the two of such three appraisals closest in value (or if there are no such two, then of all three appraisals). - 11 - (d) if the l/d other party elects to purchase the offered shares of class b common stock, it shall give notice to the l/d transferring party within ten business days after receipt of the l/d offer notice of its election (or in the case of a third party tender offer or exchange offer, at least five business days prior to the expiration date of such offer, provided that all conditions to such offer that need to be satisfied prior to acceptance for payment (other than with respect to the number of shares of class b common stock tendered) shall have been satisfied or waived and the l/d offer notice shall have been provided at least ten business days prior to the expiration date of such offer), which shall constitute a binding obligation, subject to standard terms and conditions for a stock purchase contract between two significant stockholders of an issuer (provided that the l/d transferring party shall not be required to make any representations or warranties regarding the business of the company), to purchase the offered shares of class b common stock, which notice shall include the date set for the closing of such purchase, which date shall be at least 20 business days following the delivery of such election notice, or, if later, five business days after receipt of all required regulatory approvals; provided that the closing shall only be delayed pending receipt of required regulatory approvals if (i) the l/d other party is using reasonable efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals, (ii) there is a reasonable prospect of receiving such regulatory approvals and (iii) if such closing is delayed more than 90 days after the date of the l/d other party&#146;s notice of election to purchase, then the l/d other party agrees to pay interest on the aggregate l/d offer price at the reference rate to the l/d transferring party from such date to the closing date. notwithstanding the foregoing, such time periods shall not be deemed to commence with respect to any purported notice that does not comply in all material respects with the requirements of this section 4.3(d). liberty and diller may assign their respective rights to purchase under this section 4.3 to any person who is a permitted designee. (e) if the l/d other party does not respond to the l/d offer notice within the required response time period or elects not to purchase the offered shares of class b common stock, the l/d transferring party shall be free to complete the proposed transfer (to the same proposed transferee, in the case of a privately-negotiated transaction) on terms no less favorable to the l/d transferring party or its affiliate, as the case may be, than those set forth in the l/d offer notice, provided that (x) such transfer is closed within (i) 90 days after the latest of (a) the expiration of the applicable period for the l/d other party to accept the offer from the l/d transferring party, or (b) the receipt by the l/d transferring party of notice declining the offer to purchase the shares of class b common stock or, in the case of (a) or (b), if later, five business days following receipt of all required regulatory approvals; provided that the closing shall only be delayed pending receipt of required regulatory approvals if (i) the l/d transferring party is using reasonable efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals and (ii) there is a reasonable prospect of receiving such regulatory approvals, or (ii) in the case of a public offering, within 20 days of the declaration by the commission of the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the commission pursuant to this agreement, and (y) the price at which the shares of class b common stock are transferred must be equal to or higher than the l/d offer price (except in the case of a public offering, in which case the price at which the shares of class b common stock are sold (before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be equal to at least 90% of the l/d offer price). - 12 - (f) if the l/d other party elects to exercise its right of first refusal under this section 4.3, the l/d other party shall pay the l/d offer price in cash (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) or by the delivery of marketable securities having an aggregate fair market value equal to the l/d offer price, provided , that if the securities to be so delivered by the l/d other party would not, in the l/d transferring party&#146;s possession, have at least the same general degree of liquidity as the securities the l/d transferring party was to receive in such proposed transaction (determined by reference to the l/d transferring party&#146;s ability to dispose of such securities (including, without limitation, the trading volume of such securities and the l/d other party&#146;s percentage ownership of the issuer of such securities)), then the l/d other party shall be required to deliver securities having an appraised value (calculated in accordance with the method described in section 4.3(c)) equal to the l/d offer price. if the l/d other party delivers securities in payment of the l/d offer price, it will cause the issuer of such securities to provide the l/d transferring party with customary registration rights related thereto (if, in the other transaction, the l/d transferring party would have received cash, cash equivalents, registered securities or registration rights). each of diller and liberty agrees to use his or its commercially reasonable efforts (but not to expend any money) to preserve for the other stockholder, to the extent possible, the tax benefits available to it in such proposed transaction, and to otherwise seek to structure such transaction in the most tax efficient method available. notwithstanding the foregoing, if diller pays the l/d offer price in securities, such securities must be securities that liberty is permitted to own under applicable fcc regulations. (g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 4.3, the time periods applicable to an election by the l/d other party to purchase the offered shares of class b common stock shall not be deemed to commence until the fair market value has been determined, provided that, in the case of a third party tender offer or exchange offer, in no event shall any such election be permitted within five business days prior to the latest time by which shares of class b common stock shall be tendered in such offer if all conditions to such offer that need to be satisfied prior to acceptance for payment (other than the number of shares tendered) have been satisfied or waived. each of diller and liberty agrees to use his and its best efforts to cause the fair market value to be determined as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten business days after the receipt by the l/d other party of the l/d offer notice. section 4.4. transfers of class b shares . (a) subject to the rights of first refusal pursuant to section 4.3 and subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event that any stockholder or any members of its stockholder group (the &#147; transferring stockholder &#148;) proposes to transfer any shares of class b common stock, such transferring stockholder shall send a written notice (which obligation may be satisfied by the delivery of the applicable l/d offer notice) (the &#147; exchange notice ,&#148; which term will include any corresponding l/d offer notice) to diller, if the transferring stockholder is liberty or a member of the liberty stockholder group, or to liberty, if the transferring stockholder is diller or a member of the diller stockholder group (the recipient of such notice, the &#147; non-transferring stockholder &#148;), that such transferring stockholder intends to transfer shares of class b common stock, including the number of such shares proposed to be transferred. the non-transferring stockholder shall give notice to the transferring stockholder within 10 business days of its receipt of the exchange notice of its desire to exchange some or all of such shares of class b common stock proposed to be transferred for an equivalent number of shares of common stock or its election to purchase all - 13 - such offered shares of class b common stock pursuant to section 4.3. if the non-transferring stockholder desires to exchange some or all of such shares rather than exercise its right of first refusal pursuant to section 4.3, such shares of class b common stock shall be exchanged. except to the extent necessary to avoid liability under section 16(b) of the exchange act and subject to applicable law, any such exchange shall be consummated immediately prior to the consummation of any such transfer. (b)(i) subject to paragraph (c) below, if any shares of class b common stock proposed to be transferred are not exchanged pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) above or exchanged with the company as contemplated by clause (ii) of this section 4.4(b), then prior to any such transfer, the transferring stockholder shall convert, or cause to be converted, such shares of class b common stock into shares of common stock (or such other securities of the company into which such shares are then convertible). (ii) in the event liberty or a member of its stockholder group is the transferring stockholder and the proposed transfer is (x) a block sale, or (y) a transfer, in a single transaction (other than a transfer to a qualified distribution transferee), of all of the common shares (or other equity securities of the company) beneficially owned by liberty at such time (other than any restricted equity securities (as defined in the governance agreement)) to a person (other than mr. diller, a permitted transferee or the company) not affiliated with liberty, instead of converting such shares of class b common stock to common stock pursuant to clause (i) of this section 4.4(b), the transferring stockholder will exchange, or cause to be exchanged, with the company any remaining shares of class b common stock not acquired by the non-transferring stockholder pursuant to section 4.4(a) for the number and type of shares of common stock or other securities it would have received upon conversion of such shares of class b common stock; provided , however , that in the event liberty is not reasonably satisfied that such exchange and subsequent transfer in accordance with the applicable l/d offer notice or exchange notice will not cause or result in liberty or its affiliates incurring any liability or obligation to disgorge profits under section 16 of the exchange act, then in lieu of such exchange, this clause (ii) shall not apply and liberty will convert such remaining shares of class b common stock into common stock or other securities as provided in clause (i) of this section 4.4(b). (c) the provisions of section 4.4(a) and section 4.4(b)(i) shall not be applicable to any transfers (i) to a member of such stockholder&#146;s stockholder group, (ii) from liberty, diller or their respective stockholder group to the other stockholder or its or his stockholder group subject to the terms of this agreement or (iii) to a qualified distribution transferee in a distribution transaction. section 4.5. transferees . (a) any permitted transferee or permitted designee of a stockholder, or any qualified distribution transferee in a distribution transaction, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement as if such permitted transferee, permitted designee or qualified distribution transferee were liberty (in the event of a distribution transaction, or if liberty or a permitted transferee of liberty is the transferor) or diller (if diller or a permitted transferee of diller is the transferor). prior to the initial acquisition of beneficial ownership of any common shares by a qualified distribution transferee or any permitted transferee (or a permitted designee), and as a condition thereto, the applicable - 14 - stockholder agrees (i) to cause the qualified distribution transferee (in the event of a distribution transaction) or to cause its respective permitted transferees or permitted designees to agree in writing with the other parties hereto to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement to the extent described in the preceding sentence and (ii) that (other than in the event of a distribution transaction) such stockholder shall remain directly liable for the performance by its respective permitted transferees or permitted designees of all obligations of such permitted transferees or permitted designees under this agreement. except as otherwise contemplated by this agreement (including the terms of section 4.2, section 4.3 and section 4.4 and pursuant to a distribution transaction), (i) each of diller and liberty agrees not to cause or permit any of its respective permitted transferees to cease to qualify as a member of such stockholder&#146;s stockholder group so long as such permitted transferee beneficially owns any shares of class b common stock, and if any such permitted transferee shall cease to be so qualified, such permitted transferee shall automatically upon the occurrence of such event cease to be a &#147;permitted transferee&#148; for any purpose under this agreement and (ii) each stockholder agrees not to transfer any common shares to any affiliate other than a permitted transferee of such stockholder. (b) no third party transferee shall have any rights or obligations under this agreement, except: (i) in the case of a third party transferee of liberty (or any member of the liberty stockholder group) who acquires shares of common stock and who (together with its affiliates) would not be a public stockholder, such third party transferee shall be subject to the obligations of liberty (but subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement) pursuant to section 3.1(a) (but shall not have the right to consent to any contingent matters), section 3.1(b), section 3.1(c), section 3.2, section 3.4, this section 4.5 and article vi; provided that such third party transferee shall only be subject to such obligations for so long as it would not be a public stockholder; and (ii) in the case of a third party transferee of diller (or any member of the diller stockholder group) who (together with its affiliates) upon consummation of any transfer would not be a public stockholder, such third party transferee shall be subject to the obligations of diller (but subject to the other terms and conditions of this agreement) pursuant to section 3.1(a) (but shall not have the right to consent to any contingent matters), section 3.1(b), section 3.1(c), section 3.4, this section 4.5 and article vi; provided that such third party transferee shall only be subject to such obligations for so long as it would not be a public stockholder. (c) prior to the consummation of a transfer described in section 4.5(b) to the extent rights and obligations are to be assigned, and as a condition thereto, the applicable third party transferee shall agree in writing with the other parties hereto to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement to the extent described in section 4.5(b). to the extent the third party transferee is not an &#147;ultimate parent entity&#148; (as defined in the hsr act), the ultimate parent entity of such third party transferee shall agree in writing to be directly liable for the performance of the third party transferee to the same extent liberty would be liable for the performance of its permitted transferees. - 15 - section 4.6. notice of transfer . in addition to any other notices required by this agreement, to the extent any stockholder and its permitted transferees transfer any common shares, such stockholder shall, within three business days following consummation of such transfer, deliver notice thereof to the company and the other stockholder, provided , however , that no such notice shall be required to be delivered unless the aggregate common shares transferred by such stockholder and its permitted transferees since the date of the last notice delivered by such stockholder pursuant to this section 4.6 exceeds 1% of the outstanding common shares. section 4.7. compliance with transfer provisions . any transfer or attempted transfer of common shares in violation of any provision of this agreement shall be void. section 4.8. hedging transactions . (a) pursuant to section 4.1(i), liberty is entitled to engage in one or more hedging transactions, provided that: (i) no shares of class b common stock shall be used for a hedging transaction unless such shares are first converted into shares of common stock in accordance with section 4.4(b) (after diller has had the opportunity to exercise his right to exchange such shares of class b common stock for shares of common stock pursuant to section 4.4); and (ii) the shares of common stock subject to any hedging transaction shall remain subject to the liberty proxy and no hedging transaction shall, prior to the settlement of such hedging transaction, impair diller&#146;s right to vote any shares of the common stock pursuant to section 3.3 (it being understood that a settlement of a hedging transaction may result in a disposition of the shares subject to such hedging transaction and that, upon such disposition and the termination of all of liberty&#146;s legal and beneficial ownership with respect to and economic interests in such shares, diller will not have the right to vote such shares);
