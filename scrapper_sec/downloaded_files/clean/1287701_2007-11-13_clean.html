(&#8220;msdwi&#8221;) into morgan stanley &amp; co. incorporated (&#8220;ms&amp;co.&#8221;), and ms&amp;co., the surviving entity, became morgan stanley&#8217;s principal u.s. broker-dealer. (a)&#160;&#160; in april 2003, ms&amp;co., along with nine other financial services firms operating in the u.s., reached a settlement with the securities and exchange commission (&#8220;sec&#8221;), the new york state attorney general&#8217;s office, the new york stock exchange (&#8220;nyse&#8221;), the national association of securities dealers, inc. (&#8220;nasd&#8221;), and the north american securities administrators association (on behalf of state securities regulators) to resolve their investigations relating to alleged research conflicts of interest. without admitting or denying allegations with respect to violations of certain rules of the nyse and nasd relating to investment research activities (there were no allegations of fraud or federal securities law violations made against ms&amp;co.), morgan stanley agreed, among other things, to (1) pay $25 million as a penalty, (2) pay $25 million as disgorgement of commissions and other monies, (3) provide $75 million over five years to make available independent third-party research to clients and (4) be permanently enjoined from violating certain rules of the nyse and nasd relating to investment research activities. &#160; (b)&#160;&#160; in november 2003, msdwi consented, without admitting or denying the findings, to an entry of an order (the &#8220;order&#8221;) that resolved the sec&#8217;s and nasd&#8217;s investigations into certain practices relating to msdwi&#8217;s offer and sale of certain mutual funds from january 1, 2000 to the date of the order. pursuant to the order, msdwi was ordered to (1) cease and desist from committing any violations and any future violations of section 17(a)(2) of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and rule 10b-10 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;exchange act&#8221;), (2) distribute for the benefit of certain customers who purchased funds through msdwi pursuant to marketing arrangements between msdwi and certain mutual fund complexes the amount of $50 million and (3) make certain disclosures and take certain other actions with respect to proprietary mutual funds. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160; in november 2004, morgan stanley reached a settlement with the sec to resolve an informal accounting investigation by executing an offer of settlement and agreeing to entry of a cease-and-desist order. the sec found that morgan stanley valued certain impaired aircraft in its aircraft leasing business in late 2001, late 2002 and early 2003, and certain bonds in its high-yield bond portfolio in late 2000, in a manner that did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, and thus violated financial reporting, recordkeeping and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. the resolution did not involve any restatement of past financial statements, any monetary penalty or any allegation of fraud. &#160; (d)&#160;&#160; in december 2004, ms&amp;co. and msdwi reached a settlement with the nyse under which morgan stanley executed two stipulations of facts and consent to penalty. the first stipulation was with respect to morgan stanley&#8217;s failure to comply with certain prospectus delivery requirements, operational deficiencies and other matters, and included a fine of $13 million. the second stipulation was with respect to employee defalcations, and included a fine of $6 million. &#160; (e)&#160;&#160; in january 2005, the sec announced a settlement with ms&amp;co. and goldman sachs &amp; co. resolving the sec&#8217;s investigation relating to initial public offering (&#8220;ipo&#8221;) allocation practices. the sec filed a settled civil injunction action in the united states district court for the district of columbia against ms&amp;co. relating to the allocation of stock to institutional customers in ipos underwritten during 1999 and 2000. under the terms of the settlement, morgan stanley agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a judgment enjoining it from violating rule 101 of regulation m and the payment of a $40 million civil penalty. the court approved the settlement on february 4, 2005. the complaint alleges that ms&amp;co. violated rule 101 of regulation m by attempting to induce certain customers who received allocations of ipos to place purchase orders for additional shares in the aftermarket. &#160; (f)&#160;&#160; in may 2006, ms&amp;co. reached a settlement with the sec, nyse and nasd relating to its production of email in the research analyst and ipo investigations from december 2000 through at least july 2005. the complaint alleges that morgan stanley did not timely produce emails in response to requests in those matters because it did not diligently search for back-up tapes containing responsive emails until 2005, and because it over-wrote back-up tapes potentially containing responsive email until at least december 2002. without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, morgan stanley consented to (1) a permanent injunction barring future violations of &#167;17(b) of the exchange act (which requires, among other things, that morgan stanley respond promptly to sec subpoenas and requests) and the relevant regulations promulgated thereunder and (2) the payment of a $15 million civil penalty, $5 million of which will be paid to nasd and the nyse. &#160; (g)&#160;&#160; in may 2007, ms&amp;co. consented, without admitting or denying the findings, to a censure, the entry of an order (the &#8220;order&#8221;) that resolved the sec&#8217;s investigation into violations of ms&amp;co.&#8217;s duty to obtain the best price possible for certain retail orders for over-the-counter securities processed by morgan stanley&#8217;s computerized market-making system from october 24, 2001 through december 8, 2004. pursuant to the order, morgan stanley was ordered to (1) cease and desist from committing any violations and any future violations of section 15(c)(1)(a) of the exchange act, which prohibits broker-dealers from using manipulative, deceptive or fraudulent devices or contrivances to effect securities transactions, (2) pay disgorgement of $5,949,222 and pre-judgment interest thereon of $507,978 and (3) pay a civil money penalty of $1.5 million. morgan stanley also agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to develop and implement a distribution plan for the disgorgement ordered, and to retain an independent compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review and provide a report on its automated retail order handling practices. &#160; (h)&#160;&#160; on september 27, 2007, the financial industry regulatory authority (&#8220;finra&#8221;) announced that the company entered into a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent (the &#8220;awc&#8221;) to resolve charges filed by finra on december 19, 2006. in the awc, finra found that, among other things, the company provided inaccurate information regarding the existence of pre-september 11, 2001 emails and failed to provide such emails to arbitration claimants and regulators in response to discovery obligations and regulatory inquiries, failed adequately to preserve books and records, and failed to establish and maintain systems and written procedures reasonably designed to preserve required records and to ensure that it conducted adequate searches in response to regulatory inquiries and discovery requests. the awc also included findings that the company failed to provide arbitration claimants with updates to a supervisory manual when called for in discovery. finra found that the company violated section 17(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934, rule 17a-4 thereunder, nasd conduct rules 2110, 3010 (a) and (b) and 3110, nasd procedural rule 8210 and interpretative material 10100 under the nasd code of arbitration procedure. in the settlement, the company neither admitted nor denied these findings. the settlement established a $9.5 million fund for the benefit of potentially affected arbitration claimants to be administered by a third party at the expense of the company. in addition, the company was censured and agreed to pay a $3 million regulatory fine and to retain an independent consultant to review its procedures for complying with discovery requirements in arbitration proceedings relating to the company&#8217;s retail brokerage operations. &#160; in addition, ms&amp;co. and msdwi have been involved in a number of civil proceedings which concern matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business. certain of such proceedings have resulted in findings of violation of federal or state securities laws. each of these proceedings was settled by ms&amp;co. and msdwi consenting to the entry of an order without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. all of such proceedings are reported and summarized in the ms&amp;co. form bd and the msdwi form bd filed with the sec, which descriptions are hereby incorporated by reference. &#160; schedule d the following table sets forth transactions in
