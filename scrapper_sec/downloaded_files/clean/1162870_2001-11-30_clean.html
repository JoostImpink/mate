----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 011576290 schedule 13d page 13 of 20 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- the initial per share purchase price is subject to adjustment in a number of circumstances. first, the company is required to provide the purchasers with an audited balance sheet as of june 30, 2001, together with reports on the company's reserves and the market value of marketable securities reflected on such audited balance sheet. based on this audited balance sheet and net of certain expenses incurred by the company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement and of certain losses incurred by the company, the per share purchase price is to be recalculated. if the recalculated per share purchase price is greater than the initial per share purchase price, the purchasers will be required to pay the company an amount equal to the difference between the recalculated and initial per share purchase prices, either in cash or in surrendered preference shares (valued at the higher of the recalculated per share purchase price or the then market value of the common shares), at the option of each purchaser. if the recalculated per share purchase price is less that the initial per share purchase price, the company shall issue the purchasers additional preference shares having a value (based on the recalculated per share purchase price) equal to the difference between the initial and recalculated per share purchase prices. the purchase price is subject to further adjustment based on the calculation of an "adjustment basket" by the company as soon as practicable following november 20, 2003 (or earlier if requested by the purchasers and consented to by the company). this adjustment basket is designed to represent the difference between the value of certain existing businesses and assets of the company as of june 30, 2001 and the value of those assets and businesses as of the relevant date for the calculation of the adjustment basket. finally, as soon as practicable following november 20, 2005, there is to be a further adjustment basket calculated based on the amount of certain liabilities of the company. if these adjustment baskets are less than zero, the company is required to issue additional preference shares to the purchasers. if these adjustment baskets are greater than zero, the company may repurchase common shares having an aggregate value equal to the adjustment basket. in addition, the purchasers will receive additional preference shares from the company in the event that the company's existing class b warrants become exercisable. the company agreed to seek the approval by the holders of common shares and preference shares of (a) an amendment to certain of the company's bye-laws, and (b) the issuance of common shares issuable upon conversion of all preference shares and the issuance of common shares issuable upon exercise of all class a warrants (including by operation of the anti-dilution adjustments in the class a warrants), to the extent that the number of all such common shares and common shares issued in cancellation of the class a warrants of the company in connection with the transactions under the subscription agreement would exceed 19.9% of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on november 19, 2001 (the "requisite shareholder approval"). the company and the purchasers have also agreed to seek approval by the insurance authorities in the states of florida, missouri, nebraska and wisconsin of the acquisition of greater than 9.9% of the total voting power of all shares of the company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors by the investors and h&f (the "requisite regulatory approval"). if the requisite shareholder approval or the requisite regulatory approval is not received within a specified period of time, or if the adjustment basket exceeds a specified threshold, the purchasers have the right to exchange the securities for substantially identical securities of a subsidiary of the company that the company has agreed to - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 011576290 schedule 13d page 14 of 20 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- form, which subsidiary is to have a capital structure designed to mirror that of the company and is to hold the core insurance operations of the company. the purchasers agreed that prior to the earlier of the meeting of the company's shareholders to obtain requisite shareholder approval or march 20, 2002, they will not transfer or dispose of any securities. in addition, the investors and certain other purchasers agreed that if at any time they seek to transfer or dispose of a majority of the voting power or equity of the company, that they will make such transaction available to all shareholders of the company. preference shares ----------------- the preference shares have a liquidation preference of $21.00 per share and are entitled to participating dividends with the common shares on an as-converted basis. each preference share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one common share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). in addition, each preference share is mandatorily convertible into one common share (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) upon the later of receipt of requisite shareholder approval and requisite regulatory approval and 90 days after the completion of the purchase price adjustments described above. generally, the preference shares are entitled to vote together with the common shares as a single class on an as-converted basis. however, until receipt of requisite shareholder approval and requisite regulatory approval, no purchaser shall have more than 9.9% of the outstanding voting power of the company and the purchasers shall be limited to an aggregate of 19.9% of the outstanding voting power of the company. warrants -------- each warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the company for a purchase price of $20.00. the warrants are immediately exercisable by the purchasers and expire on september 19, 2002. each warrant may be exercised through cash payment of the purchase price, through the surrender of common shares having a value equal to the purchase price or upon surrender of the warrant in exchange for common shares having a value equal to the excess of the value of the common shares that would be received on full exercise of the warrant over the purchase price of the warrant. the number of shares that are purchasable upon exercise of each warrant and the per share purchase price are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. shareholders agreement ---------------------- the shareholders agreement provides the investors with certain governance rights and contains provisions relating to the transfer and disposition of the securities. the shareholders agreement provides that immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement, the board of directors of the company shall consist of nine directors and that one director designated by the investors and one director designated by h&f shall be appointed to the board. following the receipt of requisite shareholder approval and requisite regulatory approval, the board shall be increased to 15 directors and four additional directors designated by the investors and two additional directors - ----------------------- --------------------- cusip no. 011576290 schedule 13d page 15 of 20 pages - ----------------------- --------------------- designated by h&f shall be appointed to the board. the investors and h&f shall have the right to nominate these directors to the board for so long as they retain specified percentages of the securities, and as these percentages decrease, the number of directors that the investors and h&f have the right to nominate will decrease as well. the shareholders agreement further provides that the company will not take specified actions unless these actions are approved by at least one of each of the investors' and h&f's designees to the board, and that the company will not declare any dividend or distribution on common shares, or repurchase any common shares, until such time as the company has repurchased an aggregate of $250 million in securities from the investors and h&f. each purchaser agreed to vote in favor of the matters subject to requisite shareholder approval at the shareholder meeting called for that purpose. the investors and h&f also agreed that until november 20, 2003 that they will not engage in certain transactions with the company without the approval of a majority of the directors of the company who are unaffiliated with either the investors or h&f. the shareholders agreement provides the purchasers with customary registration rights, including demand registrations, piggy-back registration rights and the right to require the company to register shares for sale on a delayed or continuous basis. as among themselves, certain of the purchasers agreed to various tag-along and drag-along rights in the event that any one of them seeks to transfer or dispose of their securities. the purchasers also agreed that until the earliest of november 20, 2002, the vesting of the company's existing class b warrants or the completion by the company of a public offering meeting certain requirements, they would not transfer or dispose of in excess of one-third of their securities. in addition, until the receipt of the requisite shareholder approval and the requisite regulatory approval, the purchasers agreed that they will not convert any preference shares into common shares, or exercise any warrant for common shares, if the common shares acquired by such purchaser upon such conversion or exercise would exceed such purchaser's pro rata portion of 19.9% of the common shares outstanding prior to november 20, 2001 or if such purchaser's holdings of common shares would require regulatory approval. * * * * except as set forth above, none of the reporting persons nor, to the best of their knowledge, any person listed in schedule i, has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company, or the disposition of securities of the company; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company; (f) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure; (g) any changes in the company's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be -

(b) the investors collectively have beneficial ownership of 20,943,229 common shares (without giving effect to the restrictions described under item 4 above), assuming the full exercise and conversion of the securities into common shares. of these common shares, 18,939,311 common shares are represented by 18,939,311 preference shares, which even if not converted into common shares would, subject to the restrictions on voting described under item 4 above, in the aggregate be entitled to the voting power equivalent to 18,939,311 common shares. each investor exercises voting power and dispositive power over its holdings of such shares through its respective general partner and its manager wp llc.

(3) fractional shares. in connection with the conversion of any ----------------- preference shares, no fractions of common shares shall be issued, but in lieu thereof, the company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price of the common shares as of the date of conversion. if more than one preference share shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full common shares issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the total number of preference shares so surrendered. (4) mechanics of conversion. (a) before any holder of preference ----------------------- shares shall be entitled to convert the same into common shares, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, or deliver an appropriate indemnity agreement, at the office of the company or its transfer agent for the preference shares and shall give written notice to the company of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for common shares are to be issued. the company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of preference shares, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of common shares to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. a certificate or certificates will be issued for the remaining preference shares in any case in which fewer than all of the preference shares represented by a certificate are converted. (b) in connection with the mandatory conversion, the company shall deliver written notice to each such holder that the conversion date has occurred and the place where certificates are to be surrendered for conversion. (5) issue taxes. the company shall pay all issue taxes, if any, ----------- incurred in respect of the issue of common shares on conversion. if a holder of shares surrendered for conversion specifies that the common shares to be issued on conversion are to be issued in a name or names other than the name or names in which such surrendered shares stand, the -6- company shall not be required to pay any transfer or other taxes incurred by reason of the issuance of such common shares to the name of another. (6) reservation of shares. the company shall at all times reserve --------------------- and keep available, free from preemptive rights, for issuance upon the conversion of preference shares, such number of its authorized but unissued common shares as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding preference shares. prior to the delivery of any securities which the company shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the preference shares, the company shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the company. all common shares delivered upon conversion of the preference shares will upon delivery be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights. (h) conversion price adjustments. the number of common shares ---------------------------- into which each preference share is convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (1) share splits and combinations. in case the company shall at any ----------------------------- time or from time to time after the issuance date (a) subdivide or split the outstanding common shares, (b) combine or reclassify the outstanding common shares into a different number of shares or (c) issue by reclassification of the common shares any shares of the company, then, and in each such case, the number of common shares into which each preference share is convertible shall be adjusted so that the holder of any preference shares thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of common shares or other securities of the company which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the occurrence of any of the events described above, had such preference shares been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this subparagraph (1) shall become effective at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (2) share dividends in common shares. in case the company at any -------------------------------- time or from time to time after the issuance date pays a dividend or makes a distribution in common shares on any class of shares of the company (other than a dividend or distribution of common shares or other securities which is made directly to the holders of preference shares pursuant to paragraph (d), or with respect to which adjustments are provided in paragraph (h)(1) above) the number of common shares into which each preference share is convertible shall be adjusted so that the holder of any preference shares thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of common shares which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to -7- receive after such dividend, had such preference shares been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the record date for the determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend. (3) distribution of indebtedness, securities or assets. in case the -------------------------------------------------- company distributes to all holders of common shares (whether by dividend or other distribution, or in a merger, amalgamation or consolidation or otherwise) evidences of indebtedness, shares of any class or series, other securities, including rights or warrants to subscribe for securities, cash or assets, in each case, of the company or any of its subsidiaries (other than a dividend or distribution which is made directly to the holders of preference shares pursuant to paragraph (d) above), the company shall distribute to the holders of preference shares the same in an amount per preference share equal to the amount as would be payable with respect to the number of common share(s) into which such preference share is convertible pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) and (h). (4) transactions in which common shares are exchanged. in case at ------------------------------------------------- any time the company shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets, liquidation or recapitalization of the common shares and excluding any transaction to which clauses (1), (2) or (3) of this paragraph (h) apply) in which the previously outstanding common shares shall be changed into or exchanged for different securities of the company or common stock or other securities of another corporation or entity (including cash) or any combination of any of the foregoing (each such transaction being a "transaction"), the company shall make all necessary provisions such that each preference share shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of common shares, the amount of securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a holder of common shares upon the consummation of the transaction if such holder had converted such preference shares immediately prior to such transaction (subject to adjustments from and after consummation of the transaction as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph (h)). (5) below market offerings of common shares. in case the --------------------------------------- company shall at any time, or from time to time, issue common shares (or securities convertible into, or exercisable for, common shares) at a price per share (or having a conversion or exercise price per share) less than the current market price (or, in the case of an issuance or sale in connection with an underwritten public offering, less than 99% of the current market price, as determined by the underwriters, less underwriting discounts and commissions) as of the date of issuance of such shares or of such other securities, then, and in each such case, the number of common shares into which each preference share is convertible shall -8- be adjusted so that the holder of each share thereof shall be entitled to receive, upon the conversion thereof, the number of common shares determined by multiplying (a) the number of common shares into which such share was convertible on the day immediately prior to such date by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (i) the number of common shares outstanding on such date and (ii) the number of additional common shares issued (or into which the other securities may convert or be exercised), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (aa) the number of common shares outstanding on such date and (bb) the number of common shares which the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of common shares so issued (or into which the other securities may convert or be exercised) would purchase at such current market price on such date. an adjustment made pursuant to this subparagraph (5) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively immediately after the close of business on such date. for purposes of this subparagraph (5), the aggregate consideration receivable by the company in connection with the issuance of common shares, or of other securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares, shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the aggregate offering price (before deduction of reasonable underwriting discounts or commissions and expenses) of all such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon conversion or exercise of any such other securities into common shares. the provisions of this clause (h) shall not apply to the issuance of any common shares (i) pursuant to any restricted share, share option, share purchase or similar plan or arrangement for the benefit of employees or directors of the company or any of its subsidiaries approved by the board of directors or a duly organized committee thereof, (ii) pursuant to options, warrants and conversion rights outstanding on november 20, 2001, or (iii) issued upon conversion of preference shares or exercise of class a warrants issued under the subscription agreement or the management subscription agreement, including pursuant to the purchase price adjustments therein.

recent average bid and asked prices per share as quoted by nasdaq or such other system or (c) the market price per share of such security as determined by the board of directors of the company (the "board of directors") as of the next preceding day, in the event neither (a) nor (b) above shall be applicable, or in the event the board of directors shall be in good faith determine that application

purchase, or any options for the purchase of, common shares or any other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common shares (such rights or options being herein called "options" and such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable shares or securities being herein -4- called "convertible securities"), whether or not such options or the right to convert, exercise or exchange any such convertible securities are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common shares are issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issuing of such options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable to the company upon the exercise of all such options, by (y) the total maximum number of common shares issuable upon the exercise of such options or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities) shall be less than the market price (or, in the case of an issuance or sale in connection with an underwritten public offering, less than 99% of the market price less underwriting discounts and commissions), determined as of the date of such issuance or sale (or, in the case of an issuance or sale pursuant to a purchase, underwriting or similar agreement, the market price determined as of the date such agreement is executed by the company), then the total maximum number of common shares issuable upon exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall (as of the date of the grant of such option) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the company for such price per share. no adjustment of the purchase price shall be made upon exercise of such options or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) below. (2) in case the company at any time shall in any manner issue or sell (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange, exercise or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common shares are issuable upon such conversion, exercise or exchange (determined by dividing (x) the total amount received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issue or sale of such convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total maximum number of common shares issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities) shall be less than the market price (or, in the case of an issuance or sale in connection with an underwritten public offering, less than 99% of the market price less underwriting discounts and commissions), determined as of the date of such issuance or sale (or, in the case of an issuance or sale pursuant to a purchase, underwriting or similar agreement, the market price determined as of the date such agreement is executed by the company), then the total maximum number of common shares issuable upon conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of such convertible securities) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issue and sold by the company for such price per share. no adjustment of the purchase price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common shares upon exercise of the rights to exchange or convert under such convertible securities, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) below. (3) if the exercise price provided for in any options referred to in subparagraph (1), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities referred to in subparagraph (1) or (2), or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in subparagraph (1) or (2) are convertible into or exchange- -5- able for common shares, shall change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed to protect against dilution of the type set forth in paragraph 3.1 or 3.3), the purchase price in effect at the time of such change shall forthwith be readjusted to the purchase price which would have been in effect at the time had such options or convertible securities still outstanding provided for such changed purchase price, additional consideration or conversion or exchange rate, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold. if the exercise price provided for in any option referred to in subparagraph (1), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible securities referred to in subparagraph (1) or (2), or the rate at which any convertible securities referred to in subparagraph (1) or (2) are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares, shall be reduced at any time under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to protect against dilution, then the purchase price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be adjusted to such respective amount as would have been obtained had such option or convertible security never been issued as to such common shares and had adjustments been made upon the issuance of common shares delivered as aforesaid, but only if as a result of such adjustment the purchase price then in effect hereunder is hereby reduced and provided that there shall be no duplication of any adjustments otherwise made in accordance with the terms hereof. (4) on the expiration of any option or the termination of any right to convert or exchange any convertible securities, the purchase price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be increased to the purchase price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such option or convertible securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. (5) in case any options shall be issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the company, together comprising one integral transaction in which no specific consideration is allocated to such options by the parties thereto, such options shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration. (6) in case any common shares, options or convertible securities shall be issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the company therefor. in case any common shares, options or convertible securities shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be the fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the board of directors. (7) the number of common shares outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the company, but the disposition of any shares so owned or held shall be considered an issue or sale of common shares for the purpose of this paragraph 3.1. (8) in case the company shall declare a dividend or make any other distribution upon the stock of the company payable in common shares, options or convertible securi- -6- ties, then in such case any common shares, options or convertible securities, as the case may be, issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without consideration. 3.2. determination of date of issuance or sale of common shares. for ---------------------------------------------------------- purposes of paragraph 3.1, in case the company shall take a record of the holders of its common shares for the purpose of determining holders entitled (x) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in common shares, options or convertible securities, or (y) to subscribe for or purchase common shares, options or convertible securities, then such record date shall be deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right or subscription or purchase, as the case may be. 3.3. subdivisions and combinations. in case the company shall at any time ----------------------------- subdivide (other than by means of a dividend payable in common shares covered by subparagraph 3.1(8)) its outstanding common shares into a greater number of shares, the purchase price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be appropriately reduced, and, conversely, in case the outstanding common shares of the company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the purchase price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased. 3.4. reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale of ------------------------------------------------------------------ assets. if any capital reorganization or reclassification of the shares of the - ------ company, or consolidation or merger of the company with another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders of common shares shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or other property with respect to or in exchange for common shares, then, as a condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holder of this warrant shall have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise hereof such common stock, securities, cash or other property issuable or payable (as part of the reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale) with respect to or in exchange for such number of outstanding common shares of the company as would have been received upon exercise of this warrant at the purchase price then in effect. the company will not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale unless prior to the consummation thereof the successor corporation (if other than the company) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument, mailed or delivered to the holder of this warrant at the last address of such holder appearing on the books of the company, the obligation to deliver to such holder such common stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to purchase. in the event that pursuant to the terms of this paragraph 3.4, this warrant becomes exercisable for securities other than common shares, then the provisions of section 3 shall apply to such securities as though such securities were common shares. if a purchase, tender or exchange offer is made to and accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding common shares of the company, the company shall not effect any consolidation, merger or sale with the person having made such offer or with any affiliate of such person unless prior to the consummation of such consolidation, merger or sale the holder of this warrant shall have been given a reasonable opportunity to then elect to receive upon the exercise of this warrant either the common shares, securities or assets then issuable with respect to the common -7- shares of the company or the common shares, securities or assets, or the equivalent, issued to previous holders of the common shares in accordance with such offer. for purposes hereof the term "affiliate" with respect to any given person shall mean any person controlling, controlled by or under

or similar plan or arrangement for the benefit of employees or directors of the company or its subsidiaries; provided that any common shares issued pursuant to any such plan or arrangement (in excess of 1,700,000 shares) shall be approved by the board of directors or a duly organized committee thereof, it being further provided that, with respect to class a warrants exercised by the initial investors or their affiliates (as defined in the registration statement filed by the company in connection with the company's public offering of its common shares), this section 3 shall apply with respect to any common shares issued pursuant to any such plan or arrangement in excess of 1,700,000 shares (ii) pursuant to options, warrants and conversion rights in existence on the date of issuance

(b) in the event that the company would be required, pursuant to section 4.5(a)(7)(e) above, to notify each participating investor or the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, of the happening of any event specified therein, the company shall, subject to the provisions of section 4.1(c) hereof, as promptly as practicable, prepare and furnish to each participating investor and to each such underwriter a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of investor shares that have been registered pursuant to this agreement, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. each participating investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company pursuant to section 4.5(a)(7)(e) hereof, it shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any sales or placement agent or agents for the investor shares and the underwriters, if any, to, forthwith discontinue disposition of the investor shares until such person shall have received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus and, if so directed by the company, to destroy or to deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its possession of the prospectus (prior to such amendment or supplement) covering such investor shares as soon as practicable after such participating investor's receipt of such notice. (c) each participating investor shall furnish to the company in writing its intended method of distribution of the investor shares it proposes to dispose of and such other information as the company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, but only to the extent that such information is required in order for the company to comply with its obligations under all applicable securities and other laws and to ensure that the prospectus relating to such investor shares conforms to the applicable requirements of the securities act. each participating investor shall notify the company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such participating investor to the company or of the occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of which any prospectus relating to the -19- investor shares contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and promptly furnish to the company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (d) in the case of any registration under section 4.1 hereof pursuant to an underwritten offering, or in the case of a registration under section 4.3 hereof if the company has determined to enter into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all investor shares to be included in such registration shall be subject to the applicable underwriting agreement and no person may participate in such registration unless such person agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided therein and completes and executes all questionnaires, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents (other than powers of attorney) which must be executed in connection therewith, and provides such other information to the company or the underwriter as may be reasonably requested to register such person's investor shares. section 4.6 registration expenses. the company shall bear all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, fees and expenses in connection with the review of underwriting arrangements by the nasd regulation, inc. (including the fees of any "qualified independent underwriter"), agent fees and commissions, printing costs and fees and disbursements of its counsel, and of one counsel as may be reasonably selected by warburg and h&f on behalf of the participating investors, and accountants, in each case, in connection with any registration and listing of any investor shares pursuant to section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, other than underwriting discounts or commissions in connection with the investor shares disposed of by any participating investor, which shall be borne by such participating investor. section 4.7 indemnification; contribution. (a) the company shall, and it hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless each participating investor and its partners, members, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, if any, and each underwriter, its partners, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, if any, in any offering or sale of common shares, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, including any amounts paid in settlement as provided herein (collectively, "claims"), arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and the company shall, and it hereby agrees to, reimburse each participating investor or any such underwriter for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such claims; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such claims arise out of or -20- are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by such participating investor or any underwriter expressly for use therein. (b) each participating investor shall, and hereby agrees to (1) indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons, if any, and each underwriter, its partners, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, if any, in any offering or sale of common shares, against any claims to which each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such claims arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such participating investor expressly for use therein, and (2) reimburse the company for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the company in connection with investigating or defending any such claim. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under section 4.7(a) or section 4.7(b) of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding for which indemnification under section 4.7(a) or section 4.7(b) may be requested, such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action or proceeding, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party in respect of such action or proceeding hereunder unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party to give such notice, and in no event shall such omission relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability it may have to such indemnified party. in case any such action or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. if the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified party with respect to such claim. the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement agreement with respect to any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought under section 4.7(a) or section 4.7(b) (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such compromise, consent or settlement includes an unconditional -21- release of the indemnified party from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and does not subject the indemnified party to any material injunctive relief or other material equitable remedy. (d) each participating investor and the company agree that if, for any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by sections 4.7(a) or 4.7(b) hereof are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any claims referred to therein (other than as a result of the provisos thereto), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of and benefits derived by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, as well as other equitable considerations. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in section 4.7(c) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article v tag-along rights; drag-along rights; restrictions on transfer and conversion section 5.1 tag-along rights; drag-along rights. (a) in the event that warburg, h&f or ge proposes to sell, convey, dispose or otherwise transfer initial shares (such party proposing to sell, the "selling investor") in a bona fide transaction to an un-affiliated third party, or in a series of related bona fide transactions to multiple un-affiliated third parties, and the net proceeds of such sale are reasonably expected to exceed $50 million (such a transaction, or series of related transactions, a "third party sale"), such selling investor shall notify the other investors having rights under this section 5.1 (each such other investor, a "tag-along investor") in writing of such third party sale, which notice shall set forth the material terms of such third party sale, including, without limitation, the number of initial shares proposed to be sold and the per share price thereof (the "third party sale notice"). such tag-along investor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in such third party sale with respect to initial shares upon providing the selling investor written notice of intent to exercise such right within ten business days of the receipt of third party sale notice; provided, however, that (i) ge shall have such rights only (a) if warburg is the selling investor, or (b) if h&f is the selling investor and warburg shall have exercised its rights to become at tag-along investor under this section 5.1, and (ii) farallon shall have such rights only (a) if h&f is the selling investor, or (b) if warburg is the selling investor and h&f shall have exercised its rights to become a tag-along investor under this section 5.1. such notice shall set forth the number of initial shares that such tag-along investor desires to sell in such third party sale, which such number shall not exceed that number of initial shares equal to the product of (i) the number of initial shares set forth in the third party sale notice, and (ii) the quotient of (a) the retained investment of such tag-along investor, over (b) the sum of (i) the retained investment of the selling investor, and (ii) the retained investment of all tag-along investors. notwithstanding the foregoing, this section -22- 5.1 shall not be applicable to any sale effected in the public markets (including by means of a "block trade" effected through any registered broker-dealer), or to any distribution to partners of any partnership in which either warburg or h&f, or any of their respective affiliates, is the general partner. (b) in the event that warburg or h&f proposes to become a selling investor under section 5.1(a), trident shall have the rights of a tag-along investor under section 5.1(a). (c) in the event that warburg and/or h&f proposes to sell, convey, dispose or otherwise transfer initial shares representing either 51% of the votes then entitled to be cast in the election of directors, or 51% of the then outstanding common shares (taking into account common shares issuable upon conversion of the preference shares) in a transaction, or in a series of related transactions, to a single person or group, warburg and h&f shall have the right to require that trident, and trident shall have the obligation to, participate in such transaction, up to a number of initial shares then beneficially owned by trident that shall not exceed that number of initial shares equal to the product of (i) the number of initial shares proposed to be transferred, and (ii) the quotient of (a) the retained investment of trident, over (b) the sum of (i) the retained investment of warburg and h&f, and (ii) the retained investment of trident and all other investors participating in such sale. (d) no tag-along investor under this sections 5.1 shall be required to assume any responsibility for any indemnification obligations arising under such third party sale in excess of the proportion of the number of initial shares sold by such party to the total number of initial shares sold in such third party sale; provided, however, that the limitation provided in this section 5.1(d) shall not be applicable to any indemnification obligations resulting from representations or warranties specifically relating to, and made by or on behalf of, such party. section 5.2 restrictions on transfer. until the earliest to occur of (a) the first anniversary of the closing, (b) the occurrence of any event that would cause company's outstanding class b warrants to vest and/or become exercisable, or (c) the completion by the company of a registered public offering of common shares the net proceeds to the company of which exceed $25 million, each of warburg, h&f, farallon, ge and trident, and each management purchaser, agrees that it or he will not sell, dispose, convey or otherwise transfer any of such investor's initial shares if, following the consummation of such sale, the retained percentage of such investor would be less that 66%; provided, however, that ge and farallon shall have the right to sell, dispose, convey or otherwise transfer initial shares to any ge permitted transferee or any farallon permitted transferee, respectively; provided, further, that such ge permitted transferee or such farallon permitted transferee, as the case may be, shall become a party hereto and agree to be bound by the terms hereof. following the earliest to occur of clauses (a), (b) or (c) in the preceding sentence, there shall be no restrictions on transfer of any initial shares, except as may be imposed by applicable law, including by the securities act. nothing in this section 5.2 shall be deemed to affect any disposition of initial shares pursuant to the terms of any merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction, or to the tender of any initial shares into any tender or exchange offer, provided, that such merger, consolidation or other business combination has been approved by, or such tender or exchange offer has been recommended to, the shareholders of the company by, the board. -23- section 5.3 restrictions on conversion. prior to the receipt of the requisite shareholder approval, no investor shall convert any preference share or exercise any class a warrant, if the number of common shares to be issued to such investor upon such conversion or exercise, together with all common shares issued upon prior conversions or exercise by such holder, would exceed such investor's permissible conversion amount. an investor's "permissible conversion amount" shall be a number of common shares equal to the product of (a) the total number of common shares issuable to such investor upon conversion or exercise of all such investor's initial shares, and (b) a fraction the numerator of which is (i) (a) the product of.199 times the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on november 19, 2001 minus (b) the 140,380 common shares issued on november 20, 2001, and the denominator of which is (ii) the total number of common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of all initial shares. prior to the receipt of the requisite shareholder approval, each holder of preference shares and class a warrants issued under the subscription agreement or the management subscription agreement shall require any transferee of preference shares or class a warrants to agree to this restriction, such that it applies to such transferee as if such transferee had acquired such securities at closing, and attributing to such transferee a pro rata portion of any conversion or exercise by the transferor, prior to such transfer. prior to receipt of the requisite regulatory approval, no investor shall convert any preference shares into common shares or exercise any class a warrants unless all necessary approvals for such ownership of common shares have been obtained, it being understood that, subject to section 5.2 hereof, this restriction on conversion and exercise shall not restrict an investor from converting or exercising and selling, or otherwise disposing of, the shares received on conversion or exercise in such a manner as would not result in violation of any applicable regulation. ge shall not convert any preference shares, or exercise any class a warrant, until such time as any required waiting period, including extensions thereof, under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, shall have expired or been terminated. article vi restrictions on dividends and share repurchases the company shall not declare any dividend or make any other distribution on, or in respect of, any common shares, and shall not repurchase any common shares, until such time as the company has repurchased from warburg and h&f, in proportion to their respective retained investments at the time of such repurchase, initial shares having an aggregate value of $250 million, at a per share price acceptable to warburg and h&f. article vii effectiveness and termination section 7.1 effectiveness. this agreement shall take effect immediately upon the closing and shall remain in effect until it is terminated pursuant to section 7.2 hereof. -24- section 7.2 termination. other than with respect to article iv hereof and with respect to the termination provisions specifically elsewhere set forth in this agreement as may be applicable to any particular section of this agreement, this agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of the following: (a) the tenth anniversary of the closing; or (b) mutual written agreement of the company, warburg and h&f at any time to terminate this agreement. article viii miscellaneous section 8.1 injunctive relief. each party hereto acknowledges that it would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of the provisions of this agreement and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that each other party shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any party from violating, any of such provisions. in connection with any action or proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this agreement specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against it enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of this agreement. section 8.2 successors and assigns. this agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the company, warburg and h&f, and for the purposes of such provisions hereof as may be indicated immediately above the signatures of farallon, ge, trident and each management purchaser, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and no such term or provision is for the benefit of, or intended to create any obligations to, any other person, except as otherwise specifically provided in this agreement. neither this agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder shall be assignable without the consent of each other party; provided, however, that in connection with any sale or transfer by warburg or h&f of any investor shares, the transferee of such investor shares may become a party hereto solely for purposes of article iv and sections 3.4, 5.2 and 5.3 hereof and have the rights of, and be subject to the obligations of, an "investor" upon due execution and delivery of a counterpart signature page hereto. notwithstanding the foregoing, ge or farallon may assign its rights hereunder to any ge permitted transferee or any farallon permitted transferee, respectively, provided such ge permitted transferee or farallon permitted transferee, as the case may be, becomes a party hereto and agrees to be bound by the terms hereof. section 8.3 amendments; waiver. this agreement may be amended only by an agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto. any party may waive in whole or in part any benefit or right provided to it under this agreement, such waiver being effective only if -25- contained in a writing executed by the waiving party. no failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition, nor shall any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right accruing to it thereafter. section 8.4 notices. except as otherwise provided in this agreement, all notices, requests,
