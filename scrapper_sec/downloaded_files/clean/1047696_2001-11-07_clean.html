calwest, rooster and gsmc have entered into a commitment letter, dated october 26, 2001, obligating gsmc to make the loan, subject to certain conditions (the "commitment letter"). the commitment letter has attached a form of loan agreement which has been negotiated among gsmc, calwest and rooster (the "loan agreement"). calwest and rooster are the borrowers under the loan. the loan will be collateralized by a pledge of (i) all membership interests in calwest, (ii) the shares held by calwest in rooster acquisition corp, (iii) the common shares held by rooster in cabot, (iv) all shares,

agreement, respectively, included as exhibit 5 to this schedule 13d, and incorporated in this item 3 in their entirety where such references and descriptions appear. item 4. purpose of the transaction -------------------------- the offer and the merger on october 28, 2001, rooster, calwest, the issuer and cabot industrial properties, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("cabot lp"), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"). on november 5, 2001, pursuant to the merger agreement, rooster and calwest commenced a tender offer (the "offer") to purchase all of the issuer's outstanding common shares at a price of $24.00 per share in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase related to the offer (the "offer to purchase"). pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to the conditions set forth therein, rooster will merge with and into the issuer and the issuer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of calwest (such events constituting the "merger"). once the merger is consummated, rooster will cease to exist as a corporation and all of the business, assets, liabilities and obligations of rooster will be merged into the issuer with the issuer remaining as the surviving entity (the "surviving entity"). as a result of the merger, each of the issuer's outstanding common shares, other than common shares owned by rooster or calwest or any wholly owned subsidiary thereof, will be converted into the right to receive $24.00 in cash. the purpose of the offer is for calwest, through rooster, to acquire all of the issuer's outstanding common shares. the purpose of the merger is for calwest to acquire through rooster all of the issuer's common shares not otherwise acquired by calwest, through rooster, in the offer. upon consummation of the merger, the issuer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of calwest. the merger agreement provides that, promptly upon the acceptance for payment and payment for common shares pursuant to the offer, rooster will be entitled to designate such number of trustees on the board of trustees of the issuer as will give rooster representation on 9 the board of trustees of the issuer in the same proportion as the number of common shares beneficially owned by calwest, rooster and their affiliates bears to the total number of common shares outstanding. at such time, the issuer will also cause, if requested by rooster, (i) each committee of the board of trustees of the issuer, (ii) the board of directors of each subsidiary of the issuer and (iii) each committee of each such subsidiary board to include designees of rooster constituting up to the same percentage of each such committee or board as rooster's designees constitute on the board of trustees of the issuer. pursuant to the merger agreement, the issuer shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause rooster's designees to be elected to the issuer's board of trustees, including by increasing the size of the board of trustees or securing the resignations of existing trustees. following the time directors designated by rooster are appointed or elected to the board of trustees of the issuer and prior to the later of the date the articles of merger with respect to the merger have been accepted for filing by the maryland state department of assessments and taxation (the "effective time"), the affirmative vote of a majority of the independent trustees (as defined below) shall be required (and sufficient) to (i) amend or terminate the merger agreement on behalf of the issuer, (ii) exercise or waive any of the issuer's rights or remedies under the merger agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations of rooster contained in the merger agreement, (iv) take any other action by the issuer in connection with the merger agreement required to be taken by the board of trustees of the issuer, or (v) take any action by the issuer in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. in the event that rooster's designees are elected to the board of trustees of the issuer, until the effective time, those continuing members of the board of trustees of the issuer who are not designees, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the federal securities laws) of rooster are to be deemed "independent trustees." the unitholder agreements and shareholder agreements concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, calwest, rooster, the issuer and cabot lp have entered into (i) agreements (the "unitholder agreements") with each of the following holders (who are not trustees or executive officers of the issuer) of limited partnership units of cabot lp (the "units"): mary p. hemmer, paul w. hemmer, sr., paul w. hemmer, jr., ph trust i, james j. viox, michael j. hemmer, dr. robert e. hemmer, hemmer family limited partnership, jon j. hemmer, maryann g. curtin, and fredrick c. boerger (the "unitholders"); and (ii) agreements (the "shareholder agreements") with each of the following persons who are trustees and/or executive officers of the issuer and each of their affiliates who hold common shares and/or units: ferdinand colloredo-mansfeld, robert e. patterson, c-m holdings l.p., alces corp., elmore patterson partners, l.p., anne e. penfield ae penfield 1999 irrevocable trust,

shareholders"). each unitholder agreement and shareholder agreement terminates immediately upon the earlier of (a) any termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms or (b) the effective time (as defined below). the unitholder agreements contemplate that the holders of 10 an aggregate of 127,936 units will convert such units into common shares and tender such common shares in the offer. the shareholder agreements contemplate that the holders of an aggregate of 1,642,475 units will convert such units into common shares and tender such common shares in the offer, and that the holders of and aggregate of 41,551 common shares will tender such common shares in the offer; provided, however, that the shareholder agreements executed by ferdinand colloredo-mansfeld, robert e.

any way restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of the subject shareholder's obligations under the unitholder or shareholder agreement, as applicable, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or by the merger agreement. each subject shareholder party to the unitholder agreement has agreed to convert the units into common shares conditional upon rooster's acceptance for payment and payment for, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer, all common shares duly tendered pursuant to the offer and not withdrawn, pursuant to the conversion rights set forth in the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of cabot lp and upon such conversion, immediately tender such common shares in the offer. each subject shareholder who is a party to a shareholder agreement has agreed: (a) to tender such subject shareholder's common shares in the offer as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than the fifth business day, following the commencement of the offer. the subject shareholder has agreed not to withdraw any common shares tendered unless the offer is terminated or has expired without rooster purchasing all common shares

cause such common shares to be voted, or consents to be executed in respect thereof, in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and (iii) vote, or execute consents in respect of, such common shares or cause such common shares to be voted, or consents to be executed in respect thereof, against: (a) any agreement or transaction relating to any (1) competing transaction (as that term is defined in the respective shareholder agreement); (2) any liquidation or dissolution of the issuer or cabot lp; (3) any proposal to approve the grant of voting rights upon "control shares" (as

any amendment of the issuer's declaration of trust or by-laws or other proposal, action or transaction involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders, which amendment or other proposal, action or transaction could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger
