(said agreement, as it may hereafter be amended or otherwise modified from time to time, being the "note agreement") with the company and parent. the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the noteholders to make advances under the note agreement that the company and parent shall have executed and delivered this agreement. parent has determined that it will receive a substantial benefit if advances are made to the company under the note agreement. in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, parent, the company and the noteholders agree as follows: article i definitions, etc. section 1.01. certain defined terms. capitalized terms used in this agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the note agreement and the annex a attached thereto (such meanings to be equally applicable to both singular and plural forms of the terms defined). section 1.02. covenant construction. each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any person, or which such person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such person. section 1.03. other rules of construction. the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this agreement shall refer to this agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this agreement. all references herein to articles, sections, annexes, exhibits and schedules shall, unless the context requires a different construction, be deemed to be references to the articles and sections of this agreement and the annexes, exhibits and schedules attached hereto and made a part hereof. in this agreement, unless a clear contrary intention appears, the word "including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including, without limiting the generality of any description preceding such term. the headings of the various articles and sections of this agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning of the terms and conditions of this agreement. no provision of this agreement shall be interpreted or construed against any party solely because that party or its legal representative drafted such provision. article ii guaranty section 2.01. guaranty. parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier by acceleration or otherwise, of any and all debts, liabilities and obligations of the company now or hereafter existing under the note agreement, the notes or any of the

bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, moratorium, receivership, reorganization or other similar debtor relief law), fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including counsel fees and legal expenses) incurred by the noteholders in connection with the protection, defense or enforcement of any rights under this agreement and any of the other transaction documents. exhibit c - page 1 section 2.02. guaranty absolute. parent unconditionally guarantees that the obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the note agreement, the notes and the other transaction documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the noteholders with respect thereto. the liability of parent under this agreement shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the note agreement, the notes, the other transaction documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (unless such invalidity or unenforceability results from a failure of consideration on the part of the noteholders); (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the note agreement, the notes or the other transaction documents; (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the obligations; (d) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the obligations or any other assets of the company; (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the company; or (f) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the company or a guarantor (except full and indefeasible payment of the obligations, including, payment of the tranche a notes, via exchange for parent common stock in accordance with article iii hereof). the obligations of parent under this agreement shall not be subject to reduction, termination or other impairment by reason of any setoff, recoupment, counterclaim or defense or for any other reason (except full and indefeasible payment of the obligations, including, payment of the tranche a notes, via exchange for parent common stock in accordance with article iii hereof). this agreement is to be in addition to and is not to prejudice or be prejudiced by any other securities or guaranties (including any guaranty signed by parent) which the noteholders may now or hereafter hold from or on account of the company and is to be binding on parent as a continuing security notwithstanding any payments from time to time made to the noteholders or any settlement of account or disability or incapacity affecting parent or any other thing whatsoever. this agreement is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the obligations and all other amounts payable under this agreement. section 2.03. waiver. parent hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the obligations and this agreement and any liability to which this agreement applies or may apply, and waives presentment, demand of payment, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, and any requirement that the noteholders institute suit, collection proceedings or take any other action to collect the obligations including any requirement that the noteholders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the company or any other person or entity or any collateral (it being the intention of the noteholders and parent that this agreement is to be a guaranty of payment and not of collection) or that the company or any other person be joined in any action hereunder. notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.12, parent hereby expressly waives each and every right to which it may be entitled by virtue of the suretyship laws of the state of texas, including, without limitation, any and all rights it may have pursuant to rule 31 or rule 32, texas rules of civil procedure, section 17.001 of the texas civil practice and remedies code and chapter 34 of the texas business and commerce code. parent hereby waives marshalling of assets and liabilities, sale in inverse order of alienation, notice by the noteholders of any indebtedness or liability to which it applies or may apply any amounts received by the noteholders, and of the creation, advancement, increase, existence, extension, renewal, rearrangement and/or modification of the obligations. section 2.04. waiver of subrogation; etc. parent will not exercise any rights of subrogation under this agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until such time as the noteholders have received full payment of the obligations. if, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amount shall be paid to parent on account of subrogation rights at any time when all the obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the noteholders and shall forthwith be paid to the noteholders to be credited and applied upon the obligations in accordance with the terms of the note agreement. parent hereby subordinates all indebtedness owing to it from the company to all indebtedness of the company to the noteholders, and agrees that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default or any event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time could become an event of default, it shall not accept any payment on the same until payment in full of the obligations, and shall in no circumstance whatsoever attempt to set off or reduce any obligations hereunder because of such indebtedness. parent further subordinates any lien or security interest that it has or may have on any collateral or security securing payment of the obligations to the liens and security interest on said collateral and security in favor of the noteholders, but the exhibit c - page 2 foregoing shall in no event imply or be construed to imply the noteholders' agreement or consent to the existence of any such security interests in favor of parent. section 2.05. right of set-off. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default the noteholders are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the noteholders to or for the credit or the account of parent against any and all of the obligations of parent now or hereafter existing under this agreement, irrespective of whether or not the noteholders shall have made any demand under this agreement and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. the noteholders agree promptly to notify parent after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. the rights of the noteholders under this section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the noteholders may have. section 2.06. transaction documents. parent acknowledges that it has had full and complete access to the note agreement, the notes and the other transaction documents, has fully reviewed same and is fully aware of their contents. section 2.07. effect of bankruptcy proceeding, etc. this agreement shall continue to be effective, or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due any noteholders pursuant to the terms of the note agreement or hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the noteholders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the company or parent, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to the company or parent or any substantial part of their property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. if an event of default shall at any time have occurred and be continuing and declaration of such event of default shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the company of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, parent agrees that, for purposes of this agreement and its obligations hereunder, the note agreement shall be deemed to have been declared in default with the same effect as if the note agreement had been declared in default in accordance with the terms thereof, and parent shall forthwith pay the amounts specified by the noteholders to be paid thereunder, any interest thereon and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder without further notice or demand. section 2.08. no waiver; remedies. no failure on the part of the noteholders to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. the remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. section 2.09. pledge agreement. parent's obligations under this agreement are secured by the pledge agreement. section 2.10. further assurances. parent hereby agrees to execute and deliver all such instruments and take all such action as the noteholders may from time to time reasonably request in order to fully effectuate the purpose of this agreement. article iii exchange agreement section 3.01. exchange.

(c) notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.01(b) hereof, during any period of time in which the parent common stock is not traded on a securities exchange or other established trading market, no special exchange event shall be deemed to occur. (d) notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.01(b), the company shall not exchange the tranche a notes for parent common stock pursuant to section 3.01(b) unless the replacement 12% convertible promissory notes evidencing the new shareholder debt are simultaneously converted pursuant to the terms of such notes. (e) notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.01(b), the company may not exercise its right to exchange all of the outstanding principal amount of the tranche a notes for parent common stock more than twice. section 3.02. exchange procedure. (a) if any tranche a noteholder desires to exchange any tranche a note for parent common stock pursuant to section 3.01(a) hereof, the holder of such tranche a note shall deliver an irrevocable written notice to the company that the holder elects so to exchange such tranche a note in accordance with the terms of section 3.01(a) hereof, and specifying the name or names (with address) in which a certificate or certificates for parent common stock are to be issued. (b) if the company elects pursuant to section 3.01(b) hereof to exchange the outstanding principal amount of the tranche a notes for parent common stock, the company shall, within 30 days after the special exchange event with respect to which such election is made, send notice (or cause notice to be sent) by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the tranche a notes at such holder's address as specified pursuant to the tranche a note agreement. each such notice of exchange shall specify the date such exchange was effected, the exchange price, the exchange rate (as defined in section 3.03), and that on and after such exchange date, interest will cease to accrue on such outstanding principal amount of the tranche a notes being so exchanged. (c) the company will, as soon as practicable after such written notice specified in section 3.02(a) or (b) hereof and compliance with any other conditions herein contained, deliver or cause to be delivered, to the holder of record of each tranche a note to be exchanged, certificates for the number of full shares of parent common stock to which such person shall be entitled upon exchange as aforesaid and a cash adjustment for any fraction of a share of parent common stock as provided in section 3.04. in the case of an exchange of a tranche a note pursuant to section 3.01(a) hereof, such exchange shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of the written notice delivered pursuant to section 3.02(a) hereof, and the person entitled to receive the parent common stock deliverable upon exchange of such tranche a note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such parent common stock on and after such date of notice. (d) upon the exchange of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of a tranche a note for common stock of parent in accordance with this agreement, the amount of the outstanding principal of such tranche a note and exhibit c - page 4 the tranche a commitment of the holder of such tranche a note shall each be automatically reduced by the principal amount of such tranche a note so exchanged. section 3.03. adjustments. the exchange price and the number of shares of parent common stock and the number or amount of any other securities and property as hereinafter provided into which a tranche a note is exchangeable (the "exchange rate") shall be subject to adjustment from time to time effective upon each occurrence of any of the following events. as used in this section 3.03 the term "shares" means, collectively, (i) the shares of parent common stock issuable upon exchange of the tranche a notes and (ii) any securities exchangeable for or issuable with respect to, the shares included in clause (i) of this definition. in case by reason of the operation of this section 3.03 the tranche a notes shall be exchangeable for any other shares of stock or other securities or property of parent or of any other corporation, any reference herein to the exchange of the tranche a notes shall be deemed to refer to and include the exchange of the tranche a notes for such other shares of stock or other securities or property. (a) if parent shall declare or pay any dividend with respect to parent common stock payable in parent common stock, subdivide the outstanding shares of parent common stock into a greater number of shares of parent common stock, or reduce the number of shares of parent common stock outstanding (by stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by repurchase of its parent common stock) (any of such events being hereinafter called a "stock split"), the exchange price and number of shares of parent common stock issuable upon exchange of any tranche a note shall be appropriately adjusted so as to entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exchange of its tranche a note, for the same aggregate consideration provided herein, the same number of shares of parent common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) as the holder would have received as a result of such stock split had such holder exchanged such tranche a note in full immediately prior to such stock split. (b) if parent shall merge or consolidate with or into one or more corporations or partnerships and parent is the sole surviving corporation, or parent shall adopt a plan of recapitalization or reorganization in which shares of parent common stock are exchanged for or changed into another class of stock or other security or property of parent, the holder of a tranche a note, for the same aggregate consideration provided herein, shall be entitled upon exchange of such tranche a note to receive in lieu of the number of shares of parent common stock for which such tranche a note would otherwise be exchangeable, the number of shares of parent common stock or other securities (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) or property to which such holder would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement or plan of merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization had such holder exchanged such tranche a note in full immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization. (c) if parent is merged or consolidated with or into one or more corporations or partnerships under circumstances in which parent is not the sole surviving corporation, or if parent sells or otherwise disposes of substantially all its assets, and in connection with any such merger, consolidation or sale the holders of parent common stock receive stock or other securities convertible into equity of the surviving or acquiring corporations or entities, or other securities or property, after the effective date of such merger, consolidation or sale, as the case may be, the holder of a tranche a note shall, for the same aggregate consideration provided herein, be entitled upon exchange of the tranche a note to receive, in lieu of shares of parent common stock for which such tranche a note would otherwise be exchangeable, shares of such stock or other securities (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) or property as the holder of such tranche a note would have received pursuant to the terms of the merger, consolidation or sale had such holder exchanged such tranche a note in full immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or sale. in the event of any consolidation, merger or sale as described in this section 3.03(c), provision shall be made in connection therewith for the surviving or acquiring corporations or partnerships to assume all obligations and duties of parent hereunder.

(b) if any shares of parent common stock required to be reserved for purposes of exchange of the tranche a notes require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be issued upon exchange, parent will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. if the parent common stock is then traded on any national securities exchange or trading market, parent will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or trading market, list and keep listed on such exchange or approved for trading on such trading market, subject to official notice of issuance, all shares of parent common stock issuable upon exchange of the tranche a notes.

(d) before taking any action that would cause an adjustment increasing the exchange rate, such that the effective exchange price would be below the then par or stated value of the parent common stock, the company and parent will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of counsel to the company and counsel to parent, be necessary in order that parent may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of parent common stock at the exchange rate as so adjusted. (e)in case parent proposes, to the extent then permitted by the transaction documents, exhibit c - page 7 (i) to pay any stock dividend upon the parent common stock or make any distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends payable out of earnings) or offer any subscription or other rights to the holders of parent common stock, or (ii) to effect any capital reorganization or reclassification of capital stock of parent, or (iii) to effect the consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of parent, or (iv) to take any other action that would result in any adjustment pursuant to section 3.03 in the number of shares or the exchange price, then the company shall cause notice of any such intended action to be given to each holder of the tranche a notes not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date on which the transfer books of parent shall close or a record be taken for such dividend or distribution, or the date when such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall be effected, or the date of such other event, as the case may be. section 3.06. exchange rate increase. (a) the company from time to time may increase the exchange rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and if the increase is irrevocable during the period. whenever the exchange rate is so increased, the company shall mail to holders of record of the tranche a notes a notice of the increase at least 15 days before the date the increased exchange rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased exchange rate and the period it will be in effect. (b) the company may make such increases in the exchange rate, in addition to those required or allowed by this article iii, as shall be determined by it, as evidenced by a resolution of the company's
