agreement of merger and plan of reorganization dated as of october 17, 2006 (the &#8220;merger agreement&#8221;) by and among the issuer, wireless acquisition holdings corp., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer (the &#8220;acquisition corp&#8221;), and h2diesel, inc., a delaware corporation (&#8220;h2diesel&#8221;). pursuant to the merger agreement, on october 20, 2006 the acquisition corp merged with and into h2diesel (the &#8220;merger&#8221;) with h2diesel as the surviving corporation. upon the effective time of the merger, each share of h2diesel&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&#8220;h2diesel common stock&#8221;), outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one share of the issuer&#8217;s common stock. as a result of these transactions, h2diesel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the issuer and h2diesel&#8217;s former security holders acquired 93.6% of the shares of common stock then outstanding. investment agreement xethanol held 5,850,000 shares of h2diesel common stock immediately prior to the merger. these shares had been issued pursuant to an investment agreement dated as of april 14, 2006 (the &#8220;original investment agreement&#8221;) by and among h2diesel, xethanol and two institutional investors and subsequently amended on june 16, 2006 (the &#8220;first amendment to investment agreement&#8221;) (the original investment agreement as amended by the first amendment to investment agreement is referred to herein as the &#8220;investment agreement&#8221;). under the investment agreement, on april 14, 2006 h2diesel issued to xethanol 2,600,000 shares of h2diesel common stock and granted xethanol the right to purchase up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of h2diesel common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $3,600,000 (the &#8220;xethanol option&#8221;) and xethanol granted the investors the right (the &#8220;put right&#8221;) to require xethanol to purchase 3,250,000 shares of h2diesel common stock owned by the investors in exchange for 500,000 shares of xethanol&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&#8220;xethanol common stock&#8221;). the shares of h2diesel common stock subject to the put right had been issued by h2diesel to the investors on march 20, 2006, together with options to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of h2diesel common stock at an aggregate exercise price of $5,000,000 (the &#8220;investor option&#8221;), in exchange for gross proceeds of $2,000,000 from the investors. of the 2,600,000 shares of h2diesel common stock issued to xethanol, 1,300,000 shares were issued to induce xethanol to enter into the put right. the fair value of these shares was $793,815, based on a share price of approximately $0.61 and was credited to xethanol&#8217;s additional paid-in capital. on april 14, 2006, the investors exercised their respective put rights and xethanol purchased the investors&#8217; 3,250,000 shares of h2diesel common stock in exchange for 500,000 shares of xethanol common stock. as a consequence of the investors&#8217; exercise of their put rights, the investor option was transferred to the company, subject to the investors&#8217; right to purchase up to 500,000 of the shares subject to the investor option upon the company&#8217;s exercise thereof. the xethanol option and the investor option expired unexercised on august 21, 2006. &#160; 3 copies of the original investment agreement and the first amendment to investment agreement are attached hereto as exhibit 10.1 and exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. management agreement in connection with the investment agreement, h2diesel and xethanol entered in to a management services agreement dated as of april 14, 2006 that was subsequently amended and restated on june 16, 2006 (the &#8220;management agreement&#8221;). under the management agreement, xethanol agreed to provide administrative, management, and consulting services to h2diesel for a period of one year from the date of the agreement. 1,300,000 of shares of h2diesel common stock issued to xethanol under the investment agreement were issued in consideration of the services xethanol was obligated to perform under the management agreement. on august 25, 2006, h2diesel elected to terminate the management agreement effective as of september 25, 2006. sublicense agreement in connection with the investment agreement, h2diesel and xethanol entered in to a sublicense agreement dated as of april 14, 2006 that was subsequently amended and restated on june 16, 2006 (the &#8220;sublicense agreement&#8221;). under the sublicense agreement, h2diesel granted xethanol an exclusive sublicense to produce h2diesel&#8217;s proprietary fuel additive (the &#8220;additive&#8221;) in maine, vermont, new hampshire, massachusetts, connecticut, rhode island, new york, pennsylvania, delaware, new jersey, virginia, west virginia, north carolina, south carolina, georgia, florida and sell products incorporating the additive (&#8220;products&#8221;) anywhere within north america, central america and the caribbean. additional territories may be added by written agreement of the parties. &#160; 4 under the sublicense agreement, h2diesel is required to sell xethanol additive in quantities sufficient to meet xethanol&#8217;s requirements for the production of products at the lower of h2diesel&#8217;s actual cost or the price at which h2diesel sells additive to unrelated third parties, or at such other price as xethanol and h2diesel may agree. xethanol is obligated to pay h2diesel royalties per gallon of products sold equal to the lesser of $0.10 per gallon or the lowest per gallon royalty that h2diesel charges to unrelated entities. during the initial term of the agreement, for each twelve-month period beginning on the date (the &#8220;trigger date&#8221;) on which h2diesel first notifies xethanol that h2diesel can produce and deliver additive in sufficient quantities to meet xethanol&#8217;s requirements, is able to do so and provides xethanol with the technical and engineering specifications necessary for a plant to produce products, xethanol is obligated to pay h2diesel a minimum royalty equal to the royalty that would have been paid had a specified amount been sold during that twelve month period. for the first such twelve-month period, the specified amount is 20,000,000 gallons of products and for each succeeding twelve-month period the amount increases by 10,000,000 gallons. if xethanol does not sell the minimum amount or pay the minimum royalties due with respect to the second or third twelve-month periods after the trigger date, then h2diesel has the option to terminate the sublicense or to convert xethanol&#8217;s exclusive rights under the sublicense to non-exclusive rights and if h2diesel elects to convert xethanol&#8217;s exclusive rights to non-exclusive rights xethanol will still be obligated to pay the minimum royalties due with respect to the initial twelve-month period. if xethanol does not sell the minimum amount or pay the minimum royalties due with respect to the fourth or any subsequent twelve-month period, then xethanol&#8217;s exclusive rights under the sublicense automatically convert to non-exclusive rights and xethanol&#8217;s obligation to pay the minimum royalties due with respect to any subsequent twelve-month period is terminated. in effect, beginning in the fourth twelve-month period xethanol may terminate its minimum royalty payment obligations with respect subsequent twelve-month periods by electing not to cure any failure to make the minimum royalty payments due with respect to the current year. if xethanol&#8217;s minimum royalty payment obligations are terminated, throughout the term of the agreement xethanol will continue to pay royalties to h2diesel for any licensed product actually sold. the initial term of the amended and restated sublicense agreement is for ten years from the trigger date. thereafter, the agreement automatically renews for successive one year periods provided there is no existing default at the time of renewal. as of october 31, 2006, the trigger date had not yet occurred. a copy of the sublicense agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference. 5 technology access agreement on june 15, 2006, h2diesel and xethanol entered into a technology access agreement (the &#8220;technology access agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which h2diesel agreed to deliver to xethanol the formula for h2diesel&#8217;s additive and all know-how in its possession, under its control or available from its licensor of the technology that relates to the manufacture of the additive. h2diesel is required to continue to provide xethanol with information regarding modifications to that formula or know-how. xethanol has no right to use the formula or the know-how so long as h2diesel is not in default of its obligations under the sublicense agreement. after an event of default, xethanol has the right to use the formula and know-how to produce the additive to meet its needs to exercise its right to sell licensed product under the sublicense agreement. xethanol must pay h2diesel the royalties it would otherwise have paid in connection with sales of licensed product, but may offset the amount by which the cost xethanol incurs in manufacturing the licensed product itself exceeds the price that xethanol would otherwise have paid h2diesel. xethanol has retained the right to seek damages from h2diesel for any excess cost of the additive. a copy of the technology access agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.4 and is incorporated herein by reference. registration rights agreement in consideration of xethanol&#8217;s consent (in its capacity as a holder of h2diesel common stock), h2diesel and xethanol entered into a registration rights agreement dated as of october 16, 2006 (the &#8220;registration rights agreement&#8221;). in connection with the merger, the issuer assumed h2diesel&#8217;s obligations under the registration rights agreement. the registration rights agreement requires the issuer, upon the written request of xethanol, but not prior to six months after the date of effectiveness of the resale registration statement to be filed by the issuer in connection with the then-pending private offering of its securities, to file a registration statement with the sec in form and substance sufficient to facilitate the distribution to xethanol&#8217;s stockholders of the shares of common stock issued to xethanol in the merger, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter. &#160; a copy of the registration rights agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 10.5 and is incorporated herein by reference. item 4. &#160;&#160; purpose of transaction &#160; the information set forth under item 3 of this schedule 13d is incorporated herein by reference. xethanol retains

to the rights reserved above, xethanol retains its rights to modify its plans with respect to the transactions described in this item 4, to acquire or dispose of securities of the issuer and to
