references to and the description of the purchase agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the purchase agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto

5, 2016, vw t&amp;b and permitted holders (the &ldquo;holders&rdquo;) are subject to a standstill provision until the date on which both (i) for the immediately preceding 30 days, no vw t&amp;b nominee has served on the board and (ii) 24 months have elapsed following the closing of the purchase agreement. during this period, holders cannot without the written consent of the issuer: (1) acquire securities of the issuer, provided that such restriction will not prohibit (a) the holders from exercising their anti-dilution rights or (b) bona fide open market purchases of common stock after the closing that would not result in any holder together with the controlled affiliates beneficially owning a number of equity securities equal to or convertible into 20% or more of the then-outstanding common stock (provided that if the issuer grants an exemption from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (&ldquo;dgcl&rdquo;) to a third party in excess of 20%, the standstill provision will be amended to reflect the higher percentage (such higher percentage, the then-applicable &ldquo;ownership cap&rdquo;); (2) participate in proxy solicitation or present any proposals at any stockholder meetings, grant any proxies or subject shares to any voting trusts; (3) make a request for books and records under the dgcl; (4) make disparaging public statements about the issuer or its current or former officers or directors, in their capacity as such; (5) institute any litigation against the issuer or any of its current and former directors or officers (including derivative actions), with certain exceptions; (6) propose or participate in any offer, merger, acquisition or other business combination or acquisition relating to a material amount of assets of the issuer (subject to certain exceptions described below); and (7) make any public proposal or take any actions that would require the issuer to make any public disclosure, with respect to the above matters. if during the standstill period a third party commences a bona fide offer for securities of the issuer representing 20% or more of the voting power and the board either publicly recommends the offer or does not recommend against the offer within 15 business days following the commencement of the offer, vw t&amp;b and its affiliates are page 6 permitted to make and publicly disclose a counterproposal to the board and/or commence an offer for 100% of the outstanding common stock. the standstill does not prevent or restrict vw t&amp;b or its affiliates&rsquo; ability to make confidential proposals to the issuer that would not reasonably be expected to result in public disclosure by the issuer. until the earlier of (i) vw t&amp;b and the controlled affiliates collectively owning less than the 7% threshold and (ii) the occurrence of a commercial termination event, if the issuer proposes to issue common stock or preferred stock or any convertible securities, the issuer must offer to sell to the holders on the same terms as the proposed issuance a portion of the issuance equal to the percentage of all common stock outstanding as of immediately before the issuance that is held by the holders; provided that the issuer will not be required to sell to the holders if (i) the issuance to the holders will require stockholder approval (but the issuer must use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the stockholder approval no later than the next annual meeting) or (ii) the sale would result in the holders and the controlled affiliates owning in excess of 20% (or, if relevant, the then-applicable ownership cap) of the outstanding common stock. if the issuer repurchases or redeems any common stock, the effect of which would be that all holders together would own in excess of 20% (or, if relevant, then the-applicable ownership cap) of the outstanding common stock, the holders must either participate in the repurchase or redemption or otherwise dispose of their shares within 90 days of exceeding the 20% threshold (or, if relevant, then the-applicable ownership cap), to the extent necessary to drop below the 20% threshold (or, if relevant, the then-applicable ownership cap). vw t&amp;b and its affiliates are subject to a three-year lock up period (but may transfer to controlled affiliates). following the expiration of the lock-up period, vw t&amp;b may transfer shares except to any schedule 13d filer of the issuer or strategic investor in or competitor of the issuer, and if the proposed transferee is an activist investor, vw t&amp;b must first offer to sell the shares to the issuer on the same pricing terms. following the expiration of the lock-up period, the holders and their affiliate transferees have shelf registration rights, including certain rights for up to a total of 3 underwritten offerings in any 12-month period if the expected aggregate gross proceeds of an underwritten offering are at least $20 million. if a shelf registration statement is not available, the holders may demand up to 2 registrations in total, provided that the holders cannot make a request for registration for less than 1,000,000 registrable shares. the holders also have customary rights to participate in certain other registered offerings of securities of the issuer. transferees of holders who acquired 5% or more of the then-outstanding common stock from vw t&amp;b and its affiliates in privately negotiated bona fide sales can transfer shares with the above-described registration rights which shall be exercisable for so long as they and their affiliates own 5% or more of the then-outstanding common stock. the stockholder agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the stock purchase agreement and (ii) the first date following the closing of the purchase agreement on which vw t&amp;b and the controlled affiliates cease to collectively own equal to or more than the 5% threshold (subject to the survival of registration rights). a copy of the stockholder agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by reference. section 203 agreement in connection with the purchase agreement, on september 5, 2016, the issuer entered into the section 203 agreement (the &ldquo;section 203 agreement&rdquo;) with vw t&amp;b that permits vw t&amp;b to acquire, subject to certain conditions and limitations, beneficial or other ownership of 15% or more, but less than 20% (or, if relevant, the then-applicable ownership cap) (the &ldquo;threshold percentage&rdquo;) of the voting power of the shares of voting stock of the issuer issued and outstanding from time to time, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under section 203 of the dgcl. if vw t&amp;b acquires 20% (or, if relevant, then the-applicable ownership cap) or more of the shares of voting stock of the issuer issued and outstanding from time to time, then section 203 of the dgcl, with certain modifications, will apply as a matter of contract, provided that if the issuer grants a waiver of section 203 to any other person that is greater than the threshold percentage, the threshold percentage in the section 203 agreement will be automatically increased to such higher percentage. a copy of the section 203 agreement is attached hereto as exhibit 5 and incorporated herein by reference. page 7 except for the agreements described above, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise), including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder&rsquo;s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, between the persons enumerated in item 2, and any other person, with respect to any securities of the issuer, including any securities pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or investment power over such securities other than standard default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1: power of attorney for volkswagen ag, dated as of february 21, 2017 (filed herewith). exhibit 2: joint filing
