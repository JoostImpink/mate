(the "company"), a pennsylvania corporation. the company's principal executive office is located at 2828 charter road, philadelphia, pennsylvania 19154. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is filed by mr. scott tarte (the "reporting person"). the business address for the reporting person is 2828 charter road, philadelphia, pennsylvania 19154. the reporting person is a citizen of the united states. mr. tarte is vice chairman of the board of the company. the reporting person during the last five years has not been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors). the reporting person during the last five years was not a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as the result of which proceeding he was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. the reporting party paid $1,000,000 in cash at the closing for his 2,000,000 shares and warrants. none of such amount was borrowed. item 4. purpose of transaction. on november 20, 2001 the reporting person, jeffrey harrow ("harrow") and the company consummated the transactions (the "closing") contemplated by the subscription agreement (the "subscription agreement") dated as of august 23, 2001 by and among the reporting person, harrow, the company and marlton technologies, inc., a new jersey corporation (the "predecessor corporation" and together with the company, the "corporation"). the subscription agreement provided for, among other things, (i) the merger (the "merger") of the predecessor corporation into the company and (ii) the sale by the company of 2,000,000 shares and warrants (the "warrants") to buy an additional 2,000,000 shares for $.50 per share to each of the reporting person and harrow. also on august 23, 2001 the predecessor corporation, the company, robert ginsburg ("ginsburg") and alan goldberg ("goldberg") entered into a subscription agreement (the "additional subscription agreement") which provided for the sale by the company of (i) 1,000,000 shares and warrants to buy an additional 1,000,000 shares to ginsburg and (ii) 300,000 shares and warrants to buy an additional 300,000 shares to goldberg. ginsburg and goldberg were parties to existing stock option agreements with the corporation (the "option agreements"), pursuant to which they were granted incentive and non-qualified stock options to purchase shares at exercise prices of $1.60 to $4.88 per share (the "option prices"). the terms of these option agreements provide that the option prices would be reduced if the corporation's board approves a transaction in which shares were subsequently issued to officers or directors of the corporation at a price lower than the option prices. in that event, the option prices would be reduced to the purchase price of such newly issued shares. the consummation of the transactions described above would trigger the option price adjustment described above. the corporation determined that a reduction in the exercise price payable under the option agreements could result in adverse accounting treatment for the corporation. therefore, the corporation asked ginsburg and goldberg, and in a letter agreement (the "letter agreement") dated as of september 27, 2001 they agreed, to cancel all the existing option agreements immediately prior to consummation of the subscription agreement. in exchange for the cancellation of the existing option agreements, the corporation agreed to issue new stock options to ginsburg and goldberg, in each case with respect to the same number of shares and same vesting schedules as were subject to their respective option agreements. these new stock options will be issued during the thirty day period commencing at least six months following the cancellation of the option agreements, with the precise date of the issuance determined by the corporation's board. in each case, the exercise price of the new options will be equal to the closing price of the shares on the new grant date, but in no event less than $0.50. finally, in each case, the corporation's obligation to issue the new options is subject to the recipient's continued employment by the corporation through the date of the new issuance, with certain exceptions for termination as a result of death or disability. as a result of the letter agreement, at present neither ginsburg nor goldberg holds any options to purchase shares. the subscription agreement also contemplated, among other things, that as part of the closing (i) the corporation would increase the number of its directors from five to seven, two members of the board would resign, harrow and a person designated by harrow would be named to the board and the reporting person and a person designated by the reporting person would be named to the board, (ii) the reporting person would enter into an employment agreement (the "employment agreement") with the corporation whereby he would be employed as its vice chairman of the board and harrow would enter into an employment agreement (the "other employment agreement") with the corporation whereby he would be employed as its chairman of the board and (iii) the reporting person, harrow, ginsburg (collectively, the "stockholders") and the corporation would enter into a stockholders' agreement (the "stockholders agreement") whereby, among other things, with certain exceptions, (a) the reporting person and harrow shall have the right to designate that number of individuals as nominees (which nominees shall include the reporting person and harrow) for election as directors as shall represent a majority of the board of directors, (b) the stockholders will vote their shares in favor of the reporting person's and harrow's designees and ginsburg, (c) without the prior written consent of ginsburg, for a period of seven years following the effective date of the stockholders agreement, the reporting person and harrow will agree not to vote any of their shares in favor of (x) the merger of the company, (y) the sale of substantially all of the company's assets, or (z) the sale of all the shares, in the event that in connection with such transaction the shares are valued at less than $2.00 per share, (d) the stockholders will recommend to the board of directors that it elect harrow as the chairman of the board of the company, ginsburg as the president and chief executive officer of the company and the reporting person as the vice chairman of the board of the company and as the chief executive officer of each subsidiary of the company and (e) the stockholders shall have a right of first refusal with respect to one another in connection with any sale of the shares held by them. as a result of the stockholders agreement, each of the stockholders might be deemed to share voting power over the shares beneficially owned by the other stockholders. the stockholders of the predecessor corporation approved the merger and the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement on november 7, 2001 and all of the other conditions having been satisfied or waived the closing took place on november 20, 2001. other than described above, the reporting person at present has no plans or proposals which relate to or would result in (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company or the disposition of securities of the company, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving the company or any of its subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors, (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company, (f) any other material change in the company's business or corporate structure, (g) additional changes in the company's charter, bylaws or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person, (h) causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association or (i) a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) as a result of the consummation on november 20, 2001 of the transactions contemplated by the subscription agreement the reporting person beneficially owns 2,000,000 shares and warrants to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares, all of which are currently exercisable. these shares and warrants represent approximately 26.72% of the shares. in addition, as a result of the stockholders agreement, the reporting person, harrow and ginsburg may be deemed to be a group (the "group") owning beneficially in the aggregate 10,116,397 shares consisting of (i) 2,00,000 sharesand warrants (all of which are exercisable) to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares, which shares and warrants are owned directly by the reporting person, (ii) 2,005,000 shares, options to purchase 25,734 shares (all of which are exercisable) and warrants (all of which are exercisable) to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares, which shares and warrants are owned directly by harrow and (iii) 1,085,663 shares and warrants (all of which are exercisable) to purchase an additional 1,000,000 shares, which shares and warrants are owned directly by ginsburg. such shares represent approximately 56.22% of the issued and outstanding shares. the provisions of the stockholders agreement are applicable to any other shares of which the stockholders acquire ownership, either directly or indirectly, after the execution of the stockholders agreement. ginsburg has disclaimed any beneficial ownership as to the 245,560 shares currently held by the company's 401k plan for the benefit of the company's employees (except those shares held for his direct benefit as a participant in such plan). ginsburg is a trustee of such plan but he did not enter into the stockholders agreement in his capacity as a trustee of the plan. the plan is not a party to the stockholders agreement in any way and is not a member of the group. thus, neither the reporting person nor harrow is the beneficial owner of the plan's shares. ginsburg has also disclaimed any beneficial ownership as to the shares owned by stanley d. ginsburg, ginsburg's father. the reporting person disclaims any beneficial ownership as to the shares held by harrow and ginsburg.
