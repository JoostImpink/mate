13. &#160; adjustments and other rights .&#160;&#160;the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; provided, that no single event shall be subject to adjustment under more than one sub-section&#160;of this section&#160;13 so as to result in duplication; provided , further , that, notwithstanding any provision of this warrant to the contrary, any adjustment shall be made to the extent (and only to the extent) that su ch adjustment would not cause or result in any warrantholder and its affiliates, collectively, being in violation of the ownership limit (excluding for purposes of this calculation any reduction in the percentage of voting securities or other capital stock of the company such warrantholder and its affiliates so owns, controls or has the power to vote resulting from transfers by the investor and its affiliates of securities purchased by the investor pursuant to the investment agreement) or any other applicable law, regulation or rule of any governmental authority or self-regulatory organization.&#160;&#160;any adjustment (or portion thereof) prohibited pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be postponed and implemented on the first date on which such implementation would not result in the condition described in such proviso. &#160; (a) &#160; common stock issued at less than the applicable price .&#160;&#160;(i)&#160;&#160;if the company issues or sells, or agrees to issue or sell, any common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or otherwise linked to common stock, other than excluded stock, for consideration per share less than the applicable price then the exercise &#160; &#160; b-11 &#160; price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance or sale will immediately (except as provided below) be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, (x)&#160;the numerator of which shall be (1)&#160;the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (including, to the extent applicable, the number of shares of common stock into which any shares of series b preferred stock and series d preferred stock then outstanding are convertible and into which this warrant and the treasury warrant are exercisable) plus (2)&#160;the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by the company for the total number of such additional shares of common stock so issued or sold would purchase a t the applicable price, and (y)&#160;the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale (including, to the extent applicable, the number of shares of common stock into which any shares of series b preferred stock and series d preferred stock then outstanding are convertible and into which this warrant and the treasury warrant are exercisable).&#160;&#160;in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x)&#160;the product of (1)&#160;the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment and (2)&#160;the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance or sale giving rise to this adjustment, by (y)&#160;the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.&#160;&#160;for the avoidance of doubt, no increase in the exercise price or reduction in the number of share s issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be made pursuant to this sub-clause&#160;(i) of this section&#160;13(a). &#160; (ii) &#160; for the purposes of any adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant pursuant to this section&#160;13(a), the following provisions shall be applicable: &#160; (1) &#160; in the case of the issuance or sale of equity or equity-linked securities for cash, the amount of the consideration received by the company shall be deemed to be the amount of the gross cash proceeds received by the company for such securities before deducting therefrom any discounts or commissions allowed, paid or incurred by the company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. &#160; (2) &#160; in the case of the issuance or sale of equity or equity-linked securities (otherwise than upon the conversion of shares of capital stock or other securities of the company) for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, including securities acquired in exchange therefor (other than securities by their terms so exchangeable), the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value, before deducting therefrom any discounts or commissions allowed, paid or incurred by the company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof. &#160; (3) &#160; in the case of the issuance of (i)&#160;options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire equity or equity-linked securities (whether or not at the time exercisable) or (ii)&#160;securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for equity or equity-linked securities (whether or not at the time so convertible or exchangeable) or &#160; &#160; b-12 &#160; options, warrants or rights to purchase such convertible or exchangeable securities (whether or not at the time exercisable): &#160; (a) &#160; the aggregate maximum number of shares of securities deliverable upon exercise of such options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire equity or equity-linked securities shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options, warrants or rights are issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in section&#160;13(a)(i) and (ii)), if any, received by the company upon the issuance or sale of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum purchase price provided in such options, warrants or rights for the equity or equity-linked securities covered thereby. &#160; (b) &#160; the aggregate maximum number of shares of equity or equity-linked securities deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange for any such convertible or exchangeable securities, or upon the exercise of options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire such convertible or exchangeable securities and the subsequent conversion or exchange thereof, shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the company for any such securities and related options, warrants or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional considera tion (in each case, determined in the manner provided in section&#160;13(a)(i) and (ii)), if any, to be received by the company upon the conversion or exchange of such securities, or upon the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire such convertible or exchangeable securities and the subsequent conversion or exchange thereof. &#160; (c) &#160; on any change in the number of shares of equity or equity-linked securities deliverable upon exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities or any change in the consideration to be received by the company upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, but excluding changes resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof (to the extent comparable to the anti-dilution provisions contained herein), the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant as then in effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such exercise price and number of shares as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance or sale of s uch options, warrants or rights not exercised prior to such change, or of such convertible or exchangeable securities not converted or exchanged prior to such change, upon the basis of such change. &#160; (d) &#160; if the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall have been adjusted upon the issuance &#160; &#160; b-13 &#160; or sale of any such options, warrants, rights or convertible or exchangeable securities, no further adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be made for the actual issuance of common stock upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof. &#160; (b) &#160; stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations .&#160;&#160;if the company shall (i)&#160;declare a dividend or make a distribution on its common stock in shares of common stock, (ii)&#160;subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii)&#160;combine or reclassify the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the warrantholder after such date s hall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of common stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive after such date had this warrant been exercised immediately prior to such date.&#160;&#160;in such event, the exercise price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x)&#160;the product of (1)&#160;the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment and (2)&#160;the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for such dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving rise to this adjustment by (y)&#160;the new number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. &#160; (c) &#160; other distributions .&#160;&#160;in case the company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its common stock (i)&#160;of shares of any class other than its common stock, (ii)&#160;of evidence of indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary, (iii)&#160;of assets or cash (excluding the amount of ordinary cash dividends, and dividends or distributions referred to in section&#160;13(b)), or (iv)&#160;of rights or warrants (other than in connection with the adoption of a shareholder rights plan), in each such case, the exercise price in effect prior thereto shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by di viding (x)&#160;an amount equal to the difference resulting from (1)&#160;the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by the exercise price per share on such record date, less (2)&#160;the fair market value of said shares or evidences of indebtedness or assets or rights or warrants to be so distributed, by (y)&#160;the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such record date; such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed.&#160;&#160;in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x)&#160;the product of (1)&#160;the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (2)&#160;the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance giving rise to this adjustment by (y)&#160;the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.&#160;&#160;in the event that s uch distribution is not so made, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the board determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants, as the case may be, to the exercise price that would then be in effect and the number of shares that would then be issuable upon exercise of this warrant if such record date had not been fixed. &#160; &#160; b-14 &#160; (d) &#160; certain repurchases of common stock .&#160;&#160;in case the company effects a pro rata repurchase of common stock, then the exercise price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the effective date of such pro rata repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i)&#160;the product of (x)&#160;the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such pro rata repurchase and (y)&#160;the market price of a share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the company or any of its affiliates of the intent to effect such pro rata repu rchase, minus (ii)&#160;the aggregate purchase price of the pro rata repurchase, and of which the denominator shall be the product of (i)&#160;the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such pro rata repurchase minus the number of shares of common stock so repurchased and (ii)&#160;the market price per share of common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement of such pro rata repurchase.&#160;&#160;in such event, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of this warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x)&#160;the product of (1)&#160;the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this warrant before such adjustment, and (2)&#160;the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the pro rata repurchase giving rise to this adjustment by (y)&#160;the new exercise price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. &#160; (e) &#160; business combinations .&#160;&#160;in case of any business combination or reclassification of common stock (other than a reclassification of common stock referred to in section&#160;13(b)), any shares (assuming, for these purposes, that the stockholder approval shall have been obtained) issued or issuable upon exercise of this warrant after the date of such business combination or reclassification shall be exchangeable for the number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the common stock issuable (at the time of such business combination or reclassification) upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such business combination or reclassification would have been entitled upon consummation of such business combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the warrantholder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable on the exercise of this warrant.&#160;&#160;in determining the kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon consummation of such business combination, if the holders of common stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon consummation of such business combination, then the warrantholder shall have the right to make a similar election upon exercise of this warrant with respect to the number of shares of stock or other securities or property which the warrantholder will receive upon exercise of this warrant. &#160; (f) &#160; rounding of calculations; minimum adjustments .&#160;&#160;all calculations under this section&#160;13 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent.&#160;&#160;any provision of this section&#160;13 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $ 0.01 or more. &#160; &#160; b-15 &#160; (g) &#160; timing of issuance of additional common stock upon certain adjustments .&#160;&#160;in any case in which the provisions of this section&#160;13 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i)&#160;issuing to the warrantholder of this warrant exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock; provided , however , &#160; that the company upon request shall deliver to such warrantholder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such warrantholder&#8217;s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. &#160; (h) &#160; adjustment for unspecified actions .&#160;&#160;if the company takes any action affecting the common stock or the common equivalent preferred stock, other than actions described in this section&#160;13, which in the reasonable judgment of the board would adversely affect the exercise rights of the warrantholder, the exercise price for the warrant and/or the number of shares received upon exercise of the warrant shall be adjusted for the warrantholder&#8217;s benefit (the &#8220; adjustment &#8221;), to the extent permitted by law, in such manner, and at such time, as the board after consultation with the warranth older shall reasonably determine to be equitable in the circumstances.&#160;&#160;in the event that an adjustment or the board&#8217;s failure to make an adjustment is disputed (each, a &#8220; disputed adjustment matter &#8221;), such disputed adjustment matter shall be resolved through the appraisal procedure mutatis mutandis . &#160; (i) &#160; statement regarding adjustments .&#160;&#160;whenever the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in section&#160;13, the company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the company a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the exercise price that shall be in effect and the number of shares into which this warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each warrantholder at the address appearing in the company&#8217;s records. &#160; (j) &#160; notice of adjustment event .&#160;&#160;in the event that the company shall propose to take any action of the type described in this section&#160;13 (but only if the action of the type described in this section&#160;13 would result in an adjustment in the exercise price or the number of shares into which this warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this warrant), the company shall give notice to the warrantholder, in the manner set forth in section&#160;13(i), which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take pla ce.&#160;&#160;such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the exercise price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of this warrant.&#160;&#160;in the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action.&#160;&#160;failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action. &#160; &#160; b-16 &#160; (k) &#160; no impairment .&#160;&#160;the company will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this warrant and in taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the warrantholder. &#160; (l) &#160; proceedings prior to any action requiring adjustment .&#160;&#160;as a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this section&#160;13, the company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, nasdaq or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of common stock that the warrantholder is entitled to receive upon exercise of this warrant pursuant to this section&#160;13. &#160; (m) &#160; adjustment rules .&#160;&#160;any adjustments pursuant to this section&#160;13 shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.&#160;&#160;if an adjustment in exercise price made hereunder would reduce the exercise price to an amount below par value of the common stock, then such adjustment in exercise price made hereunder shall reduce the exercise price to the par value of the common stock. &#160; (n) &#160; notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth herein, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall also be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this section 13 as applied to any common equivalent preferred stock, mutatis mutandis . &#160;

15. &#160; contest and appraisal rights .&#160;&#160;upon each determination of market price or fair market value, as the case may be, hereunder, the company shall promptly give notice thereof to the warrantholder, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of such market price or fair market value, and the method and basis of determination thereof, as the case may be.&#160;&#160;if the warrantholder (or if there is more than one warrantholder, a majority in interest of warrantholders) shall disagree with such determination and shall, by notice to the company given within 15 days after the company&#8217;s notice of such determination, elect to dispute such determination , such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with this section&#160;15.&#160;&#160;in the event &#160; &#160; b-17 &#160; that a determination of market price, or fair market value (if such determination solely involves market price), is disputed, such dispute shall be submitted, at the company&#8217;s expense, to a nasdaq member firm selected by the company and acceptable to the warrantholder, whose determination of market price or fair market value, as the case may be, shall be binding on the company and the warrantholder.&#160;&#160;in the event that a determination of fair market value, other than a determination solely involving market price, is disputed, such dispute shall be resolved through the appraisal procedure. &#160;
