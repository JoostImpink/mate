(the "exchange agreement") in exchange for the contribution to the company of (i) cash in the amount of $10.0 million, and (ii) the transfer of certain equity interests in the company acquired by wynopt pursuant to an option agreement dated as of may 2, 1994. the funds required by wynopt for the transaction were obtained directly from the investors in wynopt. the exchange agreement is incorporated herein by reference to exhibit 10.12 to the company's registration statement on form s-1 (registration no. 333-2214). item 4. purpose of transaction. wynopt acquired the shares of common stock held by it pursuant to the exchange agreement for investment purposes. the reporting persons may purchase additional shares of common stock either in the open market or in private transactions, depending on their evaluations of the company's business, prospects and financial condition, the market for the common stock, economic conditions, money and stock market conditions and other future developments. depending upon similar factors, and subject to the limitation described below, the reporting persons may dispose of such shares of common stock. stockholders' agreement. on may 24, 1996, wynopt entered into a stockholders' agreement (the "stockholders' agreement") with the company, various affiliates of hampstead (the "hampstead stockholders"), certain other senior executive officers of the company, wyndham employees ltd. ("wel") and certain other parties (collectively, the "crow/wyndham stockholders"), which imposes certain restrictions on the transfer of common stock held by such stockholders (the "stockholders") and entitles the stockholders to certain rights regarding corporate governance. pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, each of the stockholders agreed not to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of ("transfer") its common stock otherwise than as page 12 13 permitted by the provisions of the stockholders' agreement. the stockholders' agreement permits the following transfers: (i) open-market sales not exceeding the volume limitations imposed by rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended, (ii) sales in the company's initial public offering, and (iii) transfers of common stock by wel to the direct or indirect owners of equity interests in wel. the stockholders' agreement also provides that any stockholders may transfer any common stock, provided that the transferee agreed to be bound by the stockholders' agreement, (a) to any wholly owned affiliate of the transferring stockholder, (b) to certain transferring stockholder family members, trusts or, if the transferring stockholder is a corporation, partnership or other entity, its equity owners, (c) to certain members of the crow family or their lineal descendants (the "crow interests"), (d) to the company or to any then-existing crow/wyndham stockholder or to any full time senior executive officers of the company, (e) as a pledge to secure indebtedness, provided that the pledgee agreed to offer a right of purchase, in the event of any foreclosures of the pledge, to the other stockholders in accordance with the stockholders' agreement, and (f) to the owners of equity interests in a stockholder upon a partial or complete liquidation or dissolution of such stockholder. the stockholders' agreement further provides that except with respect to a permitted transfer described above the proposed transfer by a stockholder to a third party of common stock will be subject to a first right of purchase in favor of the stockholders in the other stockholder group (as defined below) at the price and on the other terms of the proposed third-party sale. the company has a prior right to purchase common stock subject to a proposed transfer if the offered common stock represents all of the common stock held by the crow interests, but only to the extent the purchase by the hampstead stockholders of the common stock would cause the hampstead stockholders to own more than 40% of the outstanding common stock. a similar first right of purchase requirement applies in the event of third-party sales in connection with a shelf registration or an underwritten public offering in which stockholders propose to sell common stock. under the stockholders' agreement, the hampstead stockholders and the crow/wyndham stockholders (each a "stockholder group") are each entitled to nominate a proportionate number of shares of common stock held by each stockholder group and to be allocated as proportionately as practicable between independent directors and other directors. each stockholder group is also entitled to nominate directors to serve on each of the board's committees on a similar proportionate basis. subject to certain conditions set forth in the stockholders' agreement, each stockholder group agreed to use its best efforts to elect the director nominated in accordance with the stockholders' agreement and to remove directors under certain circumstances. the stockholders' agreement further provides that as long as the crow interests own at least 30% of page 13 14 the outstanding common stock (excluding any shares acquired from a third party after the date of the stockholders' agreement), the chairman of the board of the company shall be a person designated by the crow interests. in the event the hampstead stockholders own at least 30% of the outstanding common stock (excluding any shares acquired from a third party after the date of the stockholders' agreement) and the crow interests no longer own at least such percentage, the chairman of the board of the company shall be a person designated by the hampstead stockholders. the stockholders' agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of (a) the sixth anniversary of the date of the stockholders' agreement, (b) the hampstead stockholders and the crow/wyndham stockholders collectively owning less than 37.5% of the outstanding common stock of the company, (c) the termination of management contracts under the investment program below a specified level, (d) certain changes in control of the hampstead stockholders, (e) the hampstead stockholders owning less than 50% of the number of shares of common stock held by them immediately following the company's initial public offering and (f) any distribution of common stock by the hampstead stockholders to direct or indirect owners of equity interests in the hampstead stockholders that result in such common stock being held by anyone other than a hampstead principal or an entity controlled by such a principal. the foregoing description of the stockholders' agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of stockholders agreement incorporated herein by reference to exhibit 10.13 to the company's registration statement on form s-1 (registration no. 333-2214). registration rights agreement. on may 24, 1996, the company entered into a registration rights agreement with hampstead, cf securities, l.p., harlan r. crow, susan t. groenteman, james d. carreker, wynopt and certain other parties (the "registration rights agreement") pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to certain limitations and under certain circumstances, to register for sale any shares of common stock (and other securities of the company that are exercisable to purchase, convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the company) that are held by the parties thereto (collectively, the "registrable securities"). all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the reporting persons will be registrable securities. the registration rights agreement provides that any holder of registrable securities may require the company upon written notice to register for sale such registrable securities (a "demand registration"), provided that the total amount of registrable securities to be included in the demand registration has a market value of at least $20 million and provided that notice is not given prior to six months after the effective date of the previous demand registration. if registrable securities are going to be registered by the company pursuant to a demand registration, the company must provide written notice to the page 14 15 other holders of registrable securities and permit them to include any or all registrable securities that they hold in the demand registration, provided that the amount of registrable securities requested to be registered may be limited by the underwriters in an underwritten offering based on such underwriters' determination that inclusion of the total amount of registrable securities requested for registration would materially and adversely affect the success of the offering. upon notice of a demand registration, the company is required to file a registration statement within 60 days of the date on which notice is given, although the company may postpone the filing for up to 90 days under certain circumstances. subject to the conditions stated or referred to above, the holders of registrable securities may request an unlimited number of demand registrations. hampstead and certain other parties to the registration rights agreement have agreed not to exercise any demand registration rights for a period of six months from the date of execution of the registration rights agreement. wel (as defined in the registration rights agreement) has a one time right to require the company to register the registrable securities that it holds in connection with the distribution of the registrable securities to the wel participants (the "wel registration"). other holders of registrable securities may not join the wel registration. a wel registration is not a demand registration and it is not subject to the restrictions on a demand registration, including the $20 million market value requirement. the registration rights agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, in the event the company proposes to file a registration statement with respect to an offering of any class of equity securities, other than a wel registration and certain other types of registrations, the company will offer the holders of registrable securities the opportunity to register the number of registrable securities they request to include (the "piggyback registration"), provided that the amount of registrable securities requested to be registered may be limited by the underwriters in an underwritten offering based on such underwriters' determination that inclusion of the total amount of registrable securities requested for registration would materially and adversely affect the success of the offering. the company is generally required to pay all of the expenses of demand registrations, the wel registration and piggyback registration, other than underwriting discounts and commissions. in the event of a demand registration within one year of the date of the registration rights agreement, the holders of the registrable securities being registered must pay up to $250,000 ($125,000 in the case of a shelf registration) of such expenses. the foregoing description of the registration rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of registration rights agreement incorporated herein by reference page 15 16 to exhibit 10.14 to the company's registration statement on form s-1 (registration no. 333-2214). item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.
