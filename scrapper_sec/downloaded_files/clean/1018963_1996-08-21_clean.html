of such cash payment shall equal, in the case of each fractional share, an amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, calculated as the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the high and low per share sales prices for the ati common stock on the new york stock exchange for each of the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the 4

(a) prior to the effective time, alc shall take such actions as may be necessary such that at the effective time each option (an "alc option") to purchase a share of alc common stock outstanding pursuant to the alc stock plans, whether or not then exercisable, shall become an option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including per share exercise price), a number of shares of ati common stock equal to the number of shares of alc common stock subject to such alc option. at or prior to the effective time, alc shall make all necessary arrangements with respect to the applicable alc stock plans to permit the assumption of the unexercised alc options by ati pursuant to this section 4.11; provided, however, that such arrangements shall not include any change in the terms of the applicable alc stock plans if such change would, in the opinion of alc's independent public accountants, have an adverse effect on ati's ability to account for the combination as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes. (b) prior to the effective time, alc shall take such actions as may be necessary such that at the effective time shares of alc common stock issuable pursuant to awards ("alc awards") under the alc performance share plan for key employees and each right to purchase or otherwise acquire or to designate shares of alc common stock pursuant to the alc stock acquisition and retention plan ("alc rights"), whether or not then issuable or exercisable, shall become an award or a right to purchase or otherwise acquire or to designate, on the same terms and conditions (including per share price), a number of shares of ati common stock equal to the number of shares of alc common stock subject to such alc award or alc right. at or prior to the effective time, alc shall make all necessary arrangements with respect to the applicable alc stock plans to permit the assumption of the alc rights and alc awards by ati pursuant to this section 4.11; provided, however, that such arrangements shall not include any change in the terms of the applicable alc stock plans if such change would, in the opinion of alc's independent public accountants, have an adverse effect on ati's ability to account for the combination as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes.

(f) as soon as practicable after the effective time, ati shall deliver to each holder of derivative securities an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto and such derivative security shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including further anti-dilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this section 4.11 after giving effect to the combination). ati shall comply with the terms of all such derivative securities and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, any applicable alc stock plan or ti stock plan that derivative securities which qualified for special tax treatment prior to the effective time continue to so qualify after the effective time. (g) approval and adoption of this agreement by the shareholders of alc and the stockholders of ti shall constitute, as an integral part of the combination, ratification of the alc stock plans and the ti stock plans, and the issuance of ati common stock in accordance with the terms of the derivative securities, by the shareholders of ati. section 4.12 indemnification; insurance.

involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the delaware general corporation law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, erisa excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in section c of this article eight with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. b. right to advancement of expenses. the right to indemnification conferred in section a of this article eight shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the delaware general corporation law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section b or otherwise. the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in sections a and b of this article eight shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. 2 c. right of

corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. in (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the delaware general corporation law. neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the delaware general corporation law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. in any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement or expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this article eight or otherwise shall be on the corporation. d. non-exclusivity of rights. the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this article eight shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the corporation's restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. e. insurance. the corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the

person against such expense, liability or loss under the delaware general corporation law. f. indemnification of employees and agents of the corporation. the corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation. g. amendment. any repeal or modification of this article eight shall not

(a) stock appreciation right awards. the committee is authorized to grant to any participant one or more stock appreciation rights. such stock appreciation rights may be granted either independent of or in tandem with options granted to the same participant. stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options may be granted simultaneously with, or, in the case of non-qualified stock options, subsequent to, the grant to such participant of the related option; provided, however, that: (i) any option covering any share of common stock shall expire and not be exercisable upon the exercise of any stock appreciation right with respect to the same share, (ii) any stock appreciation right covering any share of common stock shall expire and not be exercisable upon the exercise of any related option with respect to the same share, and (iii) an option and stock appreciation right covering the same share of common stock may not be exercised simultaneously. upon exercise of a stock appreciation right with respect to a share of common stock, the participant shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over (b) the exercise price of such stock appreciation right established in the award agreement, which amount shall be payable as provided in section 6.02(c). (b) exercise price. the exercise price established under any stock appreciation right granted under this plan shall be determined by the committee, but in the case of stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options shall not be less than the purchase price of the related option. upon exercise of stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options, the number of shares subject to exercise under any related option shall automatically be reduced by the number of shares of common stock represented by the option or portion thereof which are surrendered as a result of the exercise of such stock appreciation rights. (c) payment of incremental value. any payment which may become due from the company by reason of a participant's exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid to the participant as determined by the committee (i) all in cash, (ii) all in common stock, or (iii) in any combination of cash and common stock. in the event that all or a portion of the payment is made in common stock, the number of shares of common stock delivered in satisfaction of such payment shall be determined by dividing the amount of such payment or portion thereof by the fair market value on the exercise date. no fractional share of common stock shall be issued to make any payment in respect of stock appreciation rights; if any fractional share would be issuable, the combination of cash and common stock payable to the participant shall be adjusted as directed by the committee to avoid the issuance of any fractional share. 6.03 terms of stock options and stock appreciation rights. (a) conditions on exercise. an award agreement with respect to options and/or stock appreciation rights may contain such waiting periods, exercise dates and restrictions on exercise (including, but not limited to, periodic installments) as may be determined by the committee at the time of grant.

(b) disability or retirement. in the event of a participant's termination of employment by reason of disability or retirement, the right of the participant to exercise the options or stock appreciation rights which he or she was entitled to exercise upon termination of employment (or which became exercisable at a later date pursuant to section 6.03(e)(ii)) shall terminate two years after the date of such termination of employment, unless the exercise period is extended by the committee in accordance with section 6.03(d). in no event, however, may any option or stock appreciation right be exercised later than the date of expiration of the option determined pursuant to section 6.03(b)(i), (iii) or (iv).

(c) restriction on transferability. none of the restricted shares may be assigned or transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or to an inter vivos trust with respect to which the participant is treated as the owner under sections 671 through 677 of the code except to the extent that section 16 of the exchange act limits a participant's right to make such transfers), pledged or sold prior to lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto. (d) delivery of shares upon vesting. upon expiration or earlier termination of the forfeiture period without a forfeiture and the satisfaction of or release from any other conditions prescribed by the committee, or at such earlier time as provided under the provisions of section 7.03, the restrictions applicable to the restricted shares shall lapse. as promptly as administratively feasible thereafter, subject to the requirements of section 11.05, the company shall deliver to the participant or, in case of the participant's death, to the participant's beneficiary, one or more share certificates for the appropriate number of shares of common stock, free of all such restrictions, except for any restrictions that may be imposed by law. 7.02 terms of restricted shares. (a) forfeiture of restricted shares. subject to sections 7.02(b) and 7.03, all restricted shares shall be forfeited and returned to the company and all rights of the participant with respect to such restricted shares shall terminate unless the participant continues in the service of the company or a subsidiary as an employee until the expiration of the forfeiture period for such restricted shares and satisfies any and all other conditions set forth in the award agreement. the committee shall determine the forfeiture period (which may, but need not, lapse in installments) and any other terms and conditions applicable with respect to any restricted share award. (b) waiver of forfeiture period. notwithstanding anything contained in this article vii to the contrary, the committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the forfeiture period and any other conditions set forth in any award agreement under appropriate circumstances (including the death, disability or retirement of the participant or a material change in circumstances arising after the date of an award) and subject to such terms and conditions (including forfeiture of a proportionate number of the restricted shares) as the committee shall deem appropriate. 7.03 change in control. unless otherwise provided by the committee in the applicable award agreement, in the event of a change in control, all restrictions applicable to the restricted share award shall terminate fully and the participant shall immediately have the right to the delivery of share certificate or certificates for such shares in accordance with section 7.01(d). 9 article viii performance awards 8.01 performance awards. (a) award periods and calculations of potential incentive amounts. the committee may grant performance awards to participants. a performance award shall consist of the right to receive a payment (measured by the fair market value of a specified number of shares of common stock, increases in such fair market value during the award period and/or a fixed cash amount) contingent upon the extent to which certain predetermined performance targets have been met during an award period. performance awards may be made in conjunction with, or in addition to, restricted share awards made under article vii. the award period shall be two or more fiscal or calendar years as determined by the committee. the committee, in its discretion and under such terms as it deems appropriate, may permit newly eligible employees, such as those who are promoted or newly hired, to receive performance awards after an award period has commenced. (b) performance targets. the performance targets may include such goals related to the performance of the company or, where relevant, any one or more of its subsidiaries or divisions and/or the performance of a participant as may be established by the committee in its discretion. in the case of performance awards to "covered employees" (as defined in section 162(m) of the code), the targets will be limited to specified levels of one or more of the performance goals. the performance targets established by the committee may vary for different award periods and need not be the same for each participant receiving a performance award in an award period. except to the extent inconsistent with the performance-based compensation exception under section 162(m) of the code, in the case of performance awards granted to employees to whom such section is applicable, the committee, in its discretion, but only under extraordinary circumstances as determined by the committee, may change any prior determination of performance targets for any award period at any time prior to the final determination of the award when events or transactions occur to cause the performance targets to be an inappropriate measure of achievement. (c) earning performance awards. the committee, at or as soon as practicable after the date of grant, shall prescribe a formula to determine the percentage of the performance award to be earned based upon the degree of attainment of performance targets. (d) payment of earned performance awards. subject to the requirements of section 11.05, payments of earned performance awards shall be made in cash or common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock, in the discretion of the committee. the committee, in its sole discretion, may define such terms and conditions with respect to the payment of earned performance awards as it may deem desirable. 8.02 terms of performance awards. (a) termination of employment. unless otherwise provided below or in section 8.03, in the case of a participant's termination of employment prior to the end of an award period, the participant will not have earned any performance awards. (b) retirement. if a participant's termination of employment is because of retirement prior to the end of an award period, the participant will not be paid any performance awards, unless the committee, in its sole and exclusive discretion, determines that an award should be paid. in such a case, the participant shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of his or her award as determined under subsection (d).
