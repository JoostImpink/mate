the long-term incentive plan pursuant to which sharp surrendered an option, which had been granted to him on december 6, 1985, to acquire 500,000 shares at an exercise price of $12.60 per share (which, as a result of a share "split," in 1989 entitled sharp to acquire 1,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $6.30 per share), and the issuer and its principal operating subsidiary, four seasons hotels limited, agreed that four seasons hotels limited will make a payment to sharp on an arms-length sale of control of the issuer. the first portion of the payment will be an amount equal to 5% of the product of (i) the total number of variable multiple voting shares and shares outstanding at the time of the sale, and (ii) the per share consideration received by holders of shares minus $6.30. if the per share consideration received by holders of shares on the sale is equal to or more than 125% of the weighted average price of shares traded in board lots on the toronto stock exchange during the period commencing six months and ending one month before the first public announcement of the sale, sharp will be entitled to an additional payment equal to 5% of the product of (i) the total number of variable multiple voting shares and shares outstanding at the time of the sale, and (ii) the per share consideration received by holders of shares minus $20.84. the right to receive the two payments may be transferred among members of the sharp family, their holding companies and trusts. upon the death of sharp, the right to the payments passes to his legal or personal representatives, heirs or permitted assigns. the total value of the proceeds that would be paid to sharp under the long-term incentive plan if the transaction contemplated by the proposal were completed are estimated to be $288 million (based on a transaction price per share of $82.00, and assuming an aggregate of approximately 41.1 million shares and variable multiple voting shares were outstanding at the time of completion of the transaction contemplated by the proposal). the description of the terms of the long-term incentive plan contained herein is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the long-term incentive plan, which is filed as exhibit 99.4 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by reference. 8 1996 trust agreement triples is a party to a trust agreement dated october 3, 1996 with montreal trust company of canada, as trustee for the benefit of the holders of the shares, that has the effect of preventing transactions that otherwise would deprive the holders of shares of rights under applicable provincial take-over bid legislation to which they would have been entitled if the variable multiple voting shares had been shares. pursuant to the trust agreement, triples is precluded from selling any variable multiple voting shares pursuant to a take-over bid (as defined in applicable securities legislation) under circumstances in which that legislation would have required the same offer to be made to holders of shares if the sale by triples had been of shares rather than variable multiple voting shares (but otherwise on the same terms) unless a concurrent offer is made to acquire a percentage of shares at least as high as the percentage of variable multiple voting shares to be sold and offers a price per share at least as high as the price to be paid for the variable multiple voting shares. the description of the terms of the trust agreement contained herein is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the trust agreement, which is filed as exhibit 99.5 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by reference. pledge triples has pledged one million of the variable multiple voting shares to the

rights which triples may at any time have, although the bank has never indicated any intention to so register, vote or exercise any rights with respect to the pledged shares. other than as described in this item 6 and in items 3, 4 and 5 above, neither of the reporting persons has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option agreements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits exhibit title 99.1 funding and cooperation agreement, by and among kingdom hotels international, isadore sharp,

under the laws of ontario ("triples") -and- four seasons hotels inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of ontario (the "company") -and- montreal trust company of canada, a trust company incorporated under the laws of canada, as trustee for the benefit of the holders (as defined below) (the "trustee") recitals: (a) by articles of amendment effective october 3rd. 1996, the company amended its articles (which, as amended, are referred to as the ("articles") to create a class of variable voting shares (collectively, the "variable voting shares"). (b) all of the variable voting shares are owned by triples. (c) pursuant to the articles, variable voting shares automatically will convert into limited voting shares upon any transfer, except a transfer to, (a) a person who is a member of the sharp family (as defined in the articles), so long as the sharp family beneficially owns a majority of the outstanding variable voting shares, (b) a qualified purchaser (as defined in the articles), or (c) a bona fide financial institution (as contemplated by the articles). (d triples and the company are desirous of entering into this agreement to ensure that the holders (collectively, the "holders") from time to time of the limited voting shares will not be deprived of any rights under applicable take-over bid legislation to which they would have been entitled in the event of a take-over bid for the variable voting shares if the variable voting shares and the limited voting shares were a single class of shares. -2- (e) triples and the company desire to constitute the trustee as a trustee for the holders so that the holders, through the trustee, will receive the benefits of this agreement. (f) these recitals and any statements of fact in this agreement are, and shall be deemed to be, made by triples and the company and not by the trustee. now therefore this agreement witnesses that in consideration of the mutual covenants that it contains and for other valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged) the parties agree that: article 1 definitions and interpretation 1.01 definitions. in this agreement, capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the articles. 1.02 interpretation not affected by headings, etc. the division of this agreement into articles, sections and paragraphs and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this agreement. 1.03 number, gender, etc. words importing the singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa. words importing the use of any gender shall include all genders. article 2 purpose of agreement 2.01 establishment of trust. the purpose of this .agreement is to ensure that the holders will not be deprived of any rights under applicable take-over bid legislation to which they would have been entitled in the event of a take-over bid for the variable voting shares if the variable voting shares and the limited voting shares were a single class of shares. 2.02 restriction on sale. triples shall not sell any variable voting shares, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a take-over bid (as defined in applicable securities legislation) under circumstances in which that legislation would have required the same offer to be made to holders of limited voting shares if the sale by triples had been of limited voting shares rather than variable voting shares (but otherwise on the same terms) unless concurrently an offer is made to purchase limited voting shares that: (a) offers a price per limited voting share at least as high as the highest price per share paid pursuant to the take-over bid for the variable voting shares; -3- (b) provides that the percentage of outstanding limited voting shares to be taken up (exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the offer by the offeror or persons acting jointly or in concert with the offeror) is at least as high as the percentage of variable voting shares to be sold (exclusive of variable voting shares owned immediately prior to the offer by the offeror and persons acting jointly or in concert with the offeror); (c) has no condition attached other than the right not to take up and pay for limited voting shares tendered if no shares are purchased pursuant to the offer for variable voting shares; and (d) is in all other material respects identical to the offer for variable voting shares. for the purposes of this section, it shall be assumed that the offer that would have resulted in the sale of limited voting shares by triples would have constituted a take-over bid under applicable securities legislation, regardless of whether this actually would have been the case, and the varying of any material term of an offer shall be deemed to constitute the making of a new offer. 2.03 improper sale. if any person or company, other than triples, carries out a sale (including an indirect sale) that triples is restricted from carrying out pursuant to section 2.02, triples shall not at or after the time such sale becomes effective do any of the following with respect to any of the variable voting shares so sold: (a) dispose of them without the prior written consent of the trustee; (b) convert them into limited voting shares without the prior written consent of the trustee; or (c) exercise any voting rights attaching to them except in accordance with the written instructions of the trustee, with which triples shall comply. 2.04 assumptions. for the purposes of this article: (a) any sale that would result in a direct or indirect acquisition of variable voting shares or limited voting shares, or in the direct or indirect acquisition of control or direction over those shares, shall be construed to be a sale of those variable voting shares or limited voting shares, as the case may be; and (b) if there is an offer to acquire that would have been a take-over bid for the purposes of applicable securities legislation if not for the provisions of the articles that cause the variable voting shares to automatically convert into -4- limited voting shares in certain circumstances, that offer to acquire shall nonetheless be construed to be a take-over bid for the purposes of this agreement. 2.05 prevention of improper sales. triples shall use its best efforts to prevent any person or company from carrying out a sale that triples would be restricted from carrying out pursuant to section 2.02, regardless of whether that person or company is a party to this agreement. 2.05 supplement agreements. triples shall not dispose of any variable voting shares unless the disposition is conditional upon the person or company acquiring those shares entering into an agreement substantially in the form of this agreement and under which that person or company has the same rights and obligations as triples has under this agreement. neither the conversion of variable voting shares into limited voting shares nor any subsequent disposition of those limited voting shares shall constitute a disposition of variable voting shares for the purposes of this section. article 3 acceptance of trust 3.01 acceptance and conditions of trust. the trustee accepts the trust created by this agreement (the "trust") and assumes the duties created and imposed upon it by this agreement, provided that it: (a) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with this agreement, except for its own gross negligence, wilful misconduct or bad faith; (b) may, at the expense of the company, consult with legal counsel, who may be legal counsel for triples or the company, and the written advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the trustee under this agreement in good faith and in reliance thereon; (c) may execute any of the trusts and powers or perform any duties under this agreement either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed by it with due care; (d) may own shares or other securities (including evidences of indebtedness) of the company to the same extent and in the same manner as though it were not the trustee. the trustee shall not be disqualified from acting as registrar, transfer agent, paying agent or in any fiduciary capacity for, or from engaging in -5- customary business and banking activities for or with, any holder, triples or the company; (e) may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any instruction, advice, notice, opinion or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties and, subject to subsections 3.01(a) and 3.01(b), shall be under no liability with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken in accordance with such instruction, advice, notice, opinion or other document; (f) shall not be required to exercise any of the rights and powers vested in it by this agreement which would violate any applicable law or which, in its reasonable judgment, would involve it in expense or liability (including, without limitation, the payment of any taxes) unless it shall have been furnished with reasonable security or indemnity against such expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in exercising any such rights or powers and the company agrees to provide such security and indemnity as may be required; (g) undertakes to perform such duties (and only such duties) as are set forth in this agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this agreement against the trustee; (h) may treat the person in whose name any limited voting shares are registered as the owner of such shares for all purposes, unless evidence available to the trustee provides reasonable grounds for the trustee to conclude that this is not the case; (i) may at any time request written instructions from the company with respect to the interpretation of this agreement or any

requisition in writing signed in one or more counterparts by those holders and setting forth the action to be taken by the trustee. subject to section 3.04, upon receipt by the trustee of such a requisition, the trustee shall forthwith take such action as is specified in the requisition and any other action that the trustee considers necessary to enforce its rights under this agreement on behalf of the holders. 3.04 condition to action. the obligation of the trustee to take any action on behalf of the holders of the limited voting shares shall be conditional upon the trustee receiving from the company or from one or more holders such funds and indemnity as the trustee may reasonably require in respect of any costs or expenses which it may incur in connection with any such action.

holder. no holder shall have the right, other than through the trustee, to institute any action or proceeding or to exercise any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing any rights arising from this agreement unless holders shall have: (a) requested that the trustee act in the manner specified in section 3.03; and (b) provided reasonable funds and indemnity to the trustee, and the trustee shall

notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall have no obligation to compensate the trustee or reimburse the trustee for any expenses or disbursements paid, incurred or suffered by the trustee: (a) in connection with any action taken by the trustee pursuant to section 3.02 if the trustee has not delivered to the company the certificate referred to in section 3.03 in respect of that action; or (b) in any suit or litigation in which the trustee is determined to have acted in bad faith or with gross negligence or wilful misconduct. article 5 indemnification 5.01 indemnification of the

the "indemnified parties") against all claims, losses, damages, costs, penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable expenses of the trustee's legal counsel) which, without negligence, wilful misconduct or bad faith on the part of such indemnified party may be paid, incurred or suffered by the indemnified party by reason of or as a result of the trustee's acceptance or administration of the trust, its compliance with its duties set forth in this agreement, or any written or oral instructions delivered to the trustee by the company pursuant hereto. in no case shall the company be liable under this indemnity for any claim against any of the indemnified parties unless the company shall be notified by the trustee of the written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced against the indemnified parties, promptly after any of the indemnified parties shall have received any such written assertion of a claim, or shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. the company shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defence of the assertion or claim. subject to (b), below, the company may elect at any time after receipt of such notice to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce any such claim. the trustee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the trustee unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the company; or -8- (b) the named parties to any such suit include both the trustee and the company and the trustee shall have been advised by counsel acceptable to the company that there may be one or more legal defences available to the trustee that are different from or in addition to those available to the company (in which case the company shall not have the right to assume the defence of such suit on behalf of the trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the trustee). article 6 change of trustee 6.01 resignation. the trustee, or any trustee subsequently appointed, may resign at any time by giving written notice of such resignation to the company specifying the date on which its desired resignation shall become effective,

appointment of a successor trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by the successor trustee. upon receiving such notice of resignation, the company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee (which shall be a corporation or company authorized to carry on the business of a trust company in ontario) by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the resigning trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. if the company does not appoint a successor trustee, the trustee or any holder may apply to a judge of the ontario court general division for the

appointment of a successor trustee in accordance with section 6.03. 6.03 successor trustee. any successor trustee appointed as provided under this agreement shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to triples and the company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under this agreement, with like effect as if originally named as trustee in this agreement. however, on the written request of triples and the company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due to it pursuant to the provisions of this agreement, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. upon the request of any such successor trustee, triples, the company and such predecessor trustee shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. -9- 6.04 notice of successor trustee. upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided herein, the company shall cause to be mailed notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder to the holder of exchangeable shares. if triples or the company shall fail to cause such notice to be mailed within ten days after acceptance of
