(d) all shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of this warrant shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the company shall pay all taxes in respect of the issue thereof. the company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issuance of a certificate for shares of common stock or any other securities in any name other than that of the holder of this warrant; and in such case the company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such certificate until such tax shall have been paid.

(b) "original issue date" shall mean the date on which this warrant is first issued. (c) "convertible securities" shall mean any evidences of indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. (d) "additional shares of common stock" shall mean all shares of common stock issued (or, pursuant to section 3.2 hereof, deemed to be issued) by the company after the original issue date other than the shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of any of the issued options or other convertible securities described in the loan agreement ("permitted options"). (e) "rights to acquire common stock" (or "rights") shall mean all rights whenever issued by the company to acquire common stock by exercise of a warrant, option or similar call or conversion of any existing instruments, in either case for consideration fixed, in amount or by formula, as of the date of issuance other than permitted options. section 3.2 issue of securities deemed issue of additional shares of common stock. if the company at any time or from time to time after the original issue date shall issue any options or convertible securities or other rights to acquire common stock, then the maximum number of shares of common stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options, rights or, in the case of convertible securities, the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, shall be deemed to be additional shares of common stock issued as of the time of such issue, provided that additional shares of common stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the consideration per share (determined pursuant to section 3.4 hereof) of such additional shares of common stock would be less than the warrant price on the date of 23 and immediately prior to such issue, or such record date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which additional shares of common stock are deemed to be issued: (a) no further adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall be made upon the subsequent issue of shares of common stock upon the exercise of such rights or conversion or exchange of such convertible securities; (b) upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised option or right prior to exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall be readjusted, and the additional shares of common stock deemed issued as the result of the original issue of such option or right shall not be deemed issued for the purposes of any subsequent adjustment of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant; and (c) in the event of any change in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any option, right or convertible security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution provisions thereof, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall forthwith be readjusted (but not downwards) to such number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant as would have obtained had the adjustment that was made upon the issuance of such option, right or convertible security not exercised or converted prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of common stock upon the exercise or conversion of any such option, right or convertible security. section 3.3. adjustment of warrant price and number of shares issuable upon exercise. except in the case of shares issued as a stock dividend described in section 3.6, issued upon a stock split or combination as described in section 3.5, if the company shall at any time after the original issue date issue additional shares of common stock (including additional shares of common stock deemed to be issued pursuant to section 3.2 hereof) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the warrant price on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the warrant price of each warrant shall be decreased, concurrently with such issue to an amount equal to the consideration per share received by the company for the additional shares of common stock so issued or deemed issued. if the warrant price shall be so reduced or if the warrant price is reduced as a result of a book value adjustment, then the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be increased as of such reduction to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock originally issuable upon exercise of this warrant by a fraction: - the numerator of which shall be the original warrant price, and 24 - the denominator of which shall be the warrant price in effect immediately after the time of such issuance. section 3.4. determination of consideration. for purposes of this article iii, the consideration received by the company for the issue of any additional shares of common stock shall be computed as follows: (a) cash and property: such consideration shall: (1) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate of cash received by the company; (2) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the company's board of directors; and (3) in the event additional shares of common stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the company for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (1) and (2) above, as determined in good faith by the company's board of directors. (b) options, rights and convertible securities: the consideration per share received by the company for additional shares of common stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to section 3.2 hereof relating to options, rights and convertible securities, shall be determined by dividing - the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the company as consideration for the issue of such options, rights or convertible securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the company upon the exercise of such options, rights or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities, by - the maximum number of shares of common stock as set forth in the instruments relating thereto (without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such options or rights or the conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. section 3.5. adjustment for stock splits and combinations. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the original issue date effect a subdivision of the 25 outstanding common stock, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately increased. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after the original issue date combine the outstanding shares of common stock, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant immediately before the combination shall be proportionately decreased. in the event of any such subdivision or combination, the warrant price shall be adjusted to equal: (i) the warrant price immediately prior to the occurrence of any such event, (ii) multiplied by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such event and (b) the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the adjustment. any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. section 3.6. adjustment for certain dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the original issue date shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of common stock, then and in each such event (i) the warrant price shall be adjusted to equal: (i) the warrant price immediately prior to the occurrence of any such event, (ii) multiplied by a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before such event and (b) the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the adjustment, and (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant shall be increased as of the time of such issuance, to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock originally issuable upon exercise of the warrant by a fraction: - the numerator of which shall be the original warrant price, and - the denominator of which shall be the warrant price in effect immediately after the time of such adjustment. section 3.7. adjustments for other dividends and distributions. in the event the company at any time or from time to time after the original issue date shall make or issue a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the company other than shares of common stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the warrantholder shall receive upon exercise hereof in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the company that he would have received had this warrant been exercised on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period given application to all adjustments called for during such period, under this article iii. section 3.8. adjustment for reclassification, exchange, or substitution. if the

consolidation, merger or share exchange of the company with or into another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to another corporation, then this warrant shall thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the company deliverable upon exercise of this warrant would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the company's board of directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this article iii to the end that the provisions set forth in this article iii (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of this warrant. section 3.10. no impairment. the company will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, share exchange, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this article iii and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holder of this warrant against impairment. section 3.11. certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each

be furnished to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (2) the warrant price then in effect, and (3) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which then would be received upon the exercise of this warrant. despite such adjustment or readjustment, the form of this warrant need not be changed in order for the adjustments or readjustments to be valued in accordance with the provisions hereof, which shall control. section 3.12. notice of record date. in the event: (a) that the company declares a dividend (or any other distribution) on its common stock; 27 (b) that the company subdivides or combines its outstanding shares of common stock; (c) of any reclassification of the common stock of the company

(c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent that the indemnifying party may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such action which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability, or a covenant not to sue, in respect to such claim or litigation. no indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such action the defense of which has been assumed by an indemnifying party without the consent of such indemnifying party. 14 (d) other indemnification. indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the company and each seller of registrable securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority, other than the securities act. (e) indemnification payments. the indemnification required by this section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred. (f) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in the preceding subdivisions of this section 2.7 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any expense, loss, damage or liability referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such expense, loss, damage or liability (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company on the one hand and the holder or underwriter, as the case may be, on the other from the distribution of the registrable securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the holder or underwriter, as the case may be, on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such expense, loss, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company on the one hand and of the holder or underwriter, as the case may be, on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company, by the holder or by the underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that the foregoing contribution agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any indemnified person if indemnification would be unavailable to such indemnified person by reason of the proviso contained in the first sentence of subdivision (a) of this section 2.7, and in no event shall the obligation of any indemnifying party to contribute under this subdivision (f) exceed the amount that such indemnifying party would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under subdivisions (a) or (b) of this section 2.7 had been available under the circumstances. the company and the holders of registrable securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subdivision (f) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders and any underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the preceding sentence and subdivisions (c) of this section 2.7, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision (f), no holder of registrable securities or underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (i) in 15 the case of any such holder, the net proceeds received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities or (ii) in the case of an underwriter, the total price at which the registrable securities purchased by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds, in any such case, the amount of any damages that such holder or underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 3. rule 144. the company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act (including but not limited to the reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the exchange act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of rule 144 adopted by the commission under the securities act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the commission thereunder (or, if the company is not required to file such reports, will, upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, make publicly available other information) and will take such further action as any holder of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) rule 144 under the securities act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of any holder of registrable securities, the company will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 4. limitations on registration of issues of securities. from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of a majority in interest of the holders, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company giving such holder or prospective holder any registration rights the terms of which are more favorable than the registration rights granted to the holders hereunder. 5. [intentionally omitted] 6. amendments and waivers. this agreement may be amended and the company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the company shall have obtained the written consent to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the holder or holders of more than 50% of the shares of registrable securities. each holder of any registrable securities at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent authorized by this section 4, whether or not such registrable securities shall have been marked to indicate such consent; provided, however, that no amendment shall be made to section 2.7 hereof without the written consent of the company and the holder or holders of 100% of the shares of registrable securities. 7. nominees for beneficial owners. in the event that any registrable securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial owner thereof may, at its election, be treated as the holder of such registrable securities for purposes of any request or other action by any holder or holders of registrable securities pursuant to this agreement or any determination of any number or percentage of shares of registrable securities held by any holder or holders of registrable securities contemplated by this agreement. if the beneficial owner of any registrable securities so elects, the company may require assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's beneficial ownership of such registrable securities. 16 8. notices. except as otherwise provided in this agreement, all communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and either hand delivered or sent by prepaid commercial courier, telecopy or first-class registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and addressed if to the investors: to their addresses shown on schedule a hereto/ if to the company: fortune financial, inc. 10475 fortune parkway, suite 103 jacksonville, florida 32256 attention: j. john wortman, president facsimile: (904) 363-3856 with a copy to: akerman, senterfitt & eidson, p.a. 50 north laura street, suite 2750 jacksonville, florida 32202 attention: peter o. larsen facsimile: (904) 798-3730 or at such other address the investor or the company shall have given notice to other. notices sent by commercial courier services for next day delivery shall be deemed given and received the day after they are sent, notices sent by telecopy shall be deemed given and received the day they are sent, and notices sent by mail shall be deemed given and received five (5) days after being mailed as aforesaid. 9. assignment. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. in addition, and whether or not any express assignment shall have been made, the provisions of this agreement which are for the benefit of the parties hereto other than the company shall also be for the benefit of and enforceable by any subsequent holder of any registrable securities, provided, that the transferee or assignee of such rights assumes the obligations of such holder under this agreement by a written agreement reasonably acceptable to the company. 10. descriptive headings. the descriptive headings of the several sections and paragraphs of this agreement are inserted for reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 11. governing law. this agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the state of florida without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws. 17 in witness whereof, the parties have executed this agreement effective as of the day and year set forth above. fortune financial, inc. by: /s/ j. john wortman -------------------------------------- the investors: hawkeye, inc. by: /s/ arthur l. cahoon -------------------------------------- arthur l. cahoon, president mid-ohio securities corp., fbo r. lee smith (acct. 15051) by: /s/ r. lee smith -------------------------------------- r. lee smith 18 schedule a to registration rights agreement the investors hawkeye, inc. c/o arthur l. cahoon 1200 riverplace blvd., suite 902 jacksonville, florida 32207 facsimile: (904) 393-9003 mid-ohio securities corp., fbo r. lee smith (acct. 15051) c/o r. lee smith 1200 riverplace blvd., suite 902 jacksonville, florida 32207 facsimile: (904) 393-9003 19 ex-6 7 a2032015zex-6.txt ex-6 exhibit 6 shareholders' agreement this shareholders' agreement (this "agreement") is dated as of the 15th day of november, 2000 (the "effective date"), by and among the shareholders set forth on exhibit a attached hereto (hereinafter each individually referred to as "shareholder" and collectively referred to as "shareholders"), hawkeye, inc., a florida corporation ("hawkeye") and mid-ohio securities corp., fbo r. lee smith (acct. 15051) ("smith", together with hawkeye being the "purchaser"), and fortune financial, inc., a florida corporation ("ffi"). w i t n e s s e t h : whereas, shareholders collectively own or have voting power for in excess of 51% of the outstanding common stock of ffi;

against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, charges, actions, proceedings, demands, judgments, settlement costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) or deficiencies resulting from any breach of a representation and warranty, covenant or agreement by the indemnifying party and all claims, charges, actions or proceedings incident to or arising out of the foregoing. 14.2 procedure. each party entitled to indemnification under this section 14 (an "indemnified party") shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each party required to provide indemnification under this section 14 (an "indemnifying party") of any action commenced against or by it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement so long as such failure shall not have materially prejudiced the position of the indemnifying party. upon such notification, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action if it is a claim brought by a third party, if and after such assumption the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any expenses incurred by it in connection with such action except as described below. in any such action, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party

indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties 19 by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing or conflicting interests between them. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by such indemnifying party), but if settled with such consent or if there be final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss, damage or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. this section 14 shall survive closing, except as otherwise provided in section 11 hereof. 15. termination. this agreement may be terminated (a) by the mutual written consent of the purchaser and the company at any time, (b) by either party if any representation or warranty of the other party contained herein proves not to have been true and correct in any material respect when made, or (c) by either party if the other party materially breaches any covenant hereunder. 16. public announcements. the initial press release or releases concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form agreed to by the company and the purchaser. prior to closing, neither party will issue any other press release or make any other public announcement concerning this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other, except that either party may make such public disclosure as may be required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction (in which event such party will notify the other party as long in advance as practicable prior to making such disclosure and will, unless not practicable under the circumstances, give the other party the opportunity to comment on the language of the disclosure prior to making such disclosure) or by any national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed. 17. miscellaneous. this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each the parties hereto. this agreement embodies the entire agreement and

(b) dividends. (i) in the event that the corporation declares, makes or pays any dividends or other distributions upon the common stock (whether payable in cash, securities, rights or other property) other than dividends and distributions referred to in paragraph (c)(vi) of this section 5 of article iii (hereinafter in this section 5 of 2 article iii, references to section 5 or subsections of section 5 of article ii shall be referred to as "section 5(_)"), the corporation shall also declare and pay to the holders of the preferred stock, in addition to any dividends payable to them pursuant to the other provisions of this section 5, at the same time that it declares and pays such dividends or other distributions to the holders of the common stock (and with the same record date), the dividends or distributions which would have been declared and paid with respect to the common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock had all of the outstanding preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution, or if no record date is fixed, the date as of which the record holders of common stock entitled to such dividends or distributions are determined. (ii) from and after the dividend commencement date, the holders of shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive on each dividend payment date in respect of the dividend period ending on such dividend payment date (but excluding such dividend payment date), cumulative dividends payable in shares of preferred stock at a rate per annum equal to 9% of the liquidation preference of each share of the then outstanding preferred stock. (iii) so long as any shares of preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not pay or set apart for payment any full dividend on any of the parity securities or any dividend on any of the junior securities (other than dividends in parity securities to the holders of parity securities or dividends in junior securities to the holders of junior securities), or make any payment on account of, or set apart for payment money for a sinking or other similar fund for, the purchase, redemption or other retirement of any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities or any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities, and shall not permit any person directly or indirectly controlled by the corporation to purchase or redeem any of the parity securities or any of the junior securities or any such warrants, rights, calls or options, unless the accrued dividends on the preferred stock for all dividend periods ended on or prior to the date of such payment in respect of parity securities or junior securities have been or contemporaneously are paid in full. (iv) if the corporation desires to make a partial dividend payment with respect to any parity securities at a time when any accrued dividends on the preferred stock have not been paid, it may do so as long as dividends upon shares of the preferred stock and upon such parity securities are paid pro rata so that the amount of dividends paid per share on the preferred stock and such parity securities shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that the accrued dividends per share on the preferred stock and the accrued dividends on such parity securities bear to each other. 3 (c) conversion rights. (i) after approval or ratification by the shareholders of the company of the rights contained in this section 5(c), to the extent required by nasd rule, a holder of shares of preferred stock may convert such shares into common stock at any time on or before the third anniversary of the preferred stock issue date at the option of the holder thereof. except as set forth in the next sentence, for the purposes of conversion, each share of preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date (defined below) to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. if a holder of shares of preferred stock gives written notice (a "dividend conversion notice") to the corporation at least two business days but not more than 60 days prior to giving a notice of conversion pursuant to section 5(c)(ii)(b) that it will be electing to convert a specified number of shares of preferred stock and that it elects to have any accrued dividends thereon that are payable prior to the conversion date but remain unpaid as of the conversion date converted into common stock on the conversion date (thereby affording the corporation the opportunity to pay such accrued dividends in cash prior to the conversion date so that they will not be converted into common stock), then for the purposes of conversion, each share of preferred stock shall be valued at the liquidation preference plus the amount of accrued dividends thereon that are payable prior to the conversion date but remain unpaid as of the conversion date, if any, which shall be divided by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date to determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion. immediately following any such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted preferred stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive the common stock upon the conversion of preferred stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such common stock. (ii) to convert preferred stock, a holder must (a) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of preferred stock to be converted, duly endorsed in a form satisfactory to the corporation, at the office of the corporation or transfer agent for the preferred stock, (b) notify the corporation at such office that he elects to convert preferred stock and the number of shares he wishes to convert, (c) state in writing the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued, and (d) pay any transfer or similar tax if required by clause (iv) below. in the event that a holder fails to notify the corporation of the number of shares of preferred stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the "conversion date." as soon as practical following the conversion date, the corporation shall deliver a certificate representing the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion, and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of 4 the shares of preferred stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. the person in whose name the common stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the conversion date. except as expressly set forth in section 5(c)(i) or in the following provisions of this section 5(c)(ii), no adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of preferred stock which have been converted. the holder of record of a share of preferred stock at the close of business on a record date with respect to the payment of dividends on the preferred stock in accordance with section 5(b)(i) hereof will be entitled to receive such dividends with respect to such share of preferred stock on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the conversion of such share after such record date and prior to such dividend payment date. if a holder of preferred stock converts more than one share at a time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total liquidation preference of all shares of preferred stock converted. (iii) the corporation shall not issue any fractional shares of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock. instead the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment based upon the closing price of the common stock on the principal securities market or exchange on which the common stock is then listed on the business day prior to the conversion date. (iv) if a holder converts shares of preferred stock, the corporation shall pay any documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of common stock upon the conversion. however, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder's name. (v) the corporation has reserved and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued common stock or its common stock held in treasury enough shares of common stock to permit the conversion of the preferred stock in full. the corporation shall endeavor to list and keep listed on the nasdaq stock market, so long as the common stock shall be listed on the nasdaq stock market, all common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock. all shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of preferred stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. the corporation shall endeavor to comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of common stock upon conversion of preferred stock. (vi) in case the corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any class of capital stock of the corporation in common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction the 5 numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of the holders entitled to such dividends and distributions. for the purposes of this section 5(c)(vi), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the corporation. the corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of common stock held in the treasury of the corporation. (vii) in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be reduced, and, conversely, in case the outstanding shares of common stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be increased, in either case to equal the product of the conversion price in effect on such date and a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, as the case may be, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. such reduction or increase, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (viii) the capital reorganization, reclassification, conversion or exchange of common stock into securities, including securities other than common stock (other than a reclassification, conversion or exchange in connection with a business combination to which section 5(c)(xiv) below shall apply), shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than common stock to all holders of common stock, and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification, conversion or exchange into the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification, conversion or exchange shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of section 5(c)(vii) above). (ix) no adjustment in the conversion price need be made until all cumulative adjustments amount to 1% or more of the conversion price as last adjusted. any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken 6 into account in any subsequent adjustment. any adjustment to the conversion price carried forward and not theretofore made shall be made immediately prior to the conversion of any shares of preferred stock pursuant hereto. (x) for purposes of this section 5(c), "common stock" includes any stock of any class of the corporation which has no preference in respect of dividends or of amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the corporation and which is not subject to redemption by the corporation. however, subject to the provisions of section 5(c)(xiv) below, shares issuable on conversion of shares of preferred stock shall include only shares of the class designated as common stock of the corporation on the preferred stock issue date or shares of any class or classes resulting from any reclassification, conversion or exchange thereof and which have no preferences in respect of dividends or amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the corporation and which are not subject to redemption by the corporation, provided that, if at any time there shall be more than one such resulting class, the shares of each such class then so issuable shall be substantially in the proportion which the total number of shares of such class resulting from all such reclassifications, conversions or exchanges bears to the total number of shares of all such classes resulting from all such reclassifications, conversions or exchanges. (xi) whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the corporation shall promptly mail to holders of preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment. the corporation shall file with the transfer agent for the preferred stock, if any, a certificate from the corporation's chief financial officer briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. in the event of any dispute thereon, the opinion of the corporation's independent public accountants, if accepted by the board of directors of the corporation, shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of the preferred stock absent manifest error. (xii) upon a determination by the board of directors of the corporation, the corporation from time to time may reduce the conversion price if the board of directors of the corporation considers such reductions to be advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights will not be taxable to the holders of common stock by any amount. (xiii) if: (a) the corporation enters an agreement to consolidate or merge with, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to, another person, and stockholders of the corporation must approve the transaction; or 7 (b) the corporation adopts a plan of dissolution or liquidation of the corporation; the corporation shall mail to holders of the preferred stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. the corporation shall mail the notice at least 10 days before such date. however, failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (a) or (b) of this section 5(c)(xiii). (xiv) in the case of any (a) consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into any other person in which the common stock is converted into securities of another person, or the right to receive cash or assets, (b) transaction consisting of a sale or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the corporation in exchange for securities of another person, cash or assets followed by a liquidation, or (c) capital reorganization or reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of common stock other than in connection with a business combination, then, upon consummation of such transaction, each share of preferred stock shall automatically become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, or the right to receive cash or other assets, receivable upon the consolidation, merger, liquidation, capital reorganization, conversion, reclassification or exchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of preferred stock might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, liquidation, capital reorganization, conversion, reclassification or exchange (assuming such holder of common stock failed to exercise any rights of election and received per share the kind and amount of consideration receivable per share by a plurality of non-electing shares). appropriate adjustment (as determined by the board of directors of the corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of preferred stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustment of the conversion price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of preferred stock. if this section 5(c)(xiv) applies, sections 5(c)(vi), (vii) and (viii) shall be deemed not to apply. notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the corporation will not effect any transaction of the type referred to in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this section 5(c)(xiv) unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the surviving person (as defined in section 5(o) thereof, if it is not the 8 corporation, shall assume, by written instrument mailed to each record holder of preferred stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the corporation, the obligation to deliver to such holder such securities, cash or assets to which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder is entitled upon conversion. nothing contained in this section 5(c)(xiv) shall limit the rights of holders of the preferred stock to convert the preferred stock in connection with the transaction. (xv) in any case in which this section 5(c) shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event become effective from and after a record date, the corporation may elect to defer until after the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any shares of preferred stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event of the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable on the basis of the conversion price in effect immediately prior to adjustment; provided, however, that if such event shall not have occurred and authorization of such event shall be rescinded by the corporation, the conversion price shall be recomputed immediately upon such rescission to the price that would have been in effect had such event not been authorized, provided that such rescission is permitted by and effective under applicable laws. (xvi) by action of the board of directors of the corporation, the corporation may from time to time on or before the second anniversary of the preferred stock issue date, on the advice of the corporation's independent public accountants, adjust the conversion price by reducing or increasing the conversion price for the effect of the following on the corporation's net income as of the preferred stock issue date: (a) any positive or negative financial impact of any reinsurance arbitration proceedings pending on the preferred stock issue date, and (2) any redundancy or deficiency in current loss reserves which appear upon examination as determined by independent actuarial opinions.
