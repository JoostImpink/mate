(2) against any alternative transactions; and (3) in favor of any other matter necessary for the consummation of the offer (collectively, the "voting actions"), (b) granted to union pacific an irrevocable proxy coupled with an interest to vote the subject shares with respect to the voting actions, (c) agreed that they will not grant a proxy or power of attorney with respect to any of the subject shares, (d) agreed to waive any rights of appraisal available in the merger and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions, (e) agreed that they have not and will not enter into any voting agreement, voting trust or similar understanding or obligation with respect to the subject shares and that any such arrangements previously entered into or granted with respect to the subject shares has expired or been revoked or terminated, (f) agreed not to donate, pledge, encumber, issue, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, in any manner the subject shares or change, modify or alter in any manner the beneficial ownership (as defined in the shareholder agreements) of any of the subject shares, (h) agreed not to solicit, initiate or encourage the making or submission of any proposal, or participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations, that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any third party acquisition proposal or make any arrangement to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the exchange of the subject shares pursuant to the offer or the merger or any other transaction contemplated thereby, or enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any third party acquisition proposal. mr. friedland's shareholder agreement provides that he is not required to take any action or make any election which conflicts with his existing contractual obligations imposed by margin accounts he maintains with respect to his 188,153 subject shares. the covenants and agreements contained in the shareholder agreements will terminate upon the termination of the merger agreement. the foregoing summaries of the merger agreement and the shareholder agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of such agreements attached hereto as exhibit 99.1, exhibit 99.2 and exhibit 99.3, respectively. (h) and (i). the tender of shares of issuer stock pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of shares of issuer stock that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of holders of shares of issuer stock and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares of issuer stock held by the public. nasdaq national market listing. depending upon the number of shares of issuer stock purchased pursuant to the offer, the shares of issuer stock may no longer meet the requirements of the national association of securities dealers for continued inclusion on the nasdaq national market: if the nasdaq national market were to cease to publish quotations for the shares of issuer stock, it is possible that the shares of issuer stock would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be reported by other sources. the extent of the public market for such shares of issuer stock and the availability of such quotations would depend, however, upon such factors as the number of shareholders and/or the aggregate market value of such securities remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the shares of issuer stock on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration under the securities and exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as described below, and other factors. union pacific cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of shares of issuer stock that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the shares of issuer stock or whether it would cause future market prices to be greater or lesser than union pacific is presently offering. registration under the exchange act. shares of issuer stock are currently registered under the exchange act. the issuer can terminate that registration upon application to the sec if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and if there are fewer than 300 holders of record of shares of issuer stock. termination of registration of the shares of issuer stock under the exchange act would reduce the information that the issuer must furnish to its shareholders and to the sec and would make certain provisions of the exchange act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of section 16(b) and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with shareholders meetings pursuant to section 14(a) and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to shareholders, no longer applicable with respect to shares of issuer stock. in addition, if shares of issuer stock are no longer registered under the exchange act, the requirements of rule 13e-3 under the exchange act with respect to "going-private" transactions would no longer be applicable to the issuer. furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of the issuer and persons holding "restricted securities" of the issuer to dispose of such securities pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act may be impaired or eliminated. if registration of the shares under the exchange act were terminated, they would no longer be eligible for nasdaq national market listing or for continued inclusion on the federal reserve board's list of "margin securities." status as "margin securities." the shares of issuer stock are presently "margin securities" under the regulations of the federal reserve board, which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of shares of issuer stock. depending on the factors similar to those described above with respect to listing and market quotations, following consummation of the offer, the shares of issuer stock may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the federal reserve board's margin regulations, in which event the shares of issuer stock would be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers. if registration of the shares of issuer stock is not terminated prior to the merger, then the registration of the shares under the exchange act and the quotation of the shares on the nasdaq national market will be terminated following the completion of the merger. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b). as of the date hereof, union pacific does not own any shares of issuer stock. however, as a result of entering into the shareholder agreements with the subject shareholders, union pacific possesses shared power to vote or direct the vote of, and thus may be deemed to beneficially own, 4,046,153 shares of issuer stock, or approximately 62.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of issuer stock as of october 15, 2001. with respect to the voting actions, union pacific has the power to vote or cause the vote of the subject shares in accordance with the terms of the shareholder agreements. neither the filing of this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that union pacific is the beneficial owner of the issuer stock referred to in this paragraph for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. union pacific does not, and, to the knowledge of union pacific, none of the persons listed on schedule i, beneficially owns any shares of issuer stock other than as set forth herein. (c) no transactions in the issuer stock were effected by union pacific, or, to the best knowledge of union pacific, any of the persons listed on schedule i hereto, during the 60-day period preceding the date hereof. (d) none, other than the current holders of the subject shares. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to the securities of the issuer. except as set forth in this schedule 13d, to the knowledge of union pacific, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 or listed on schedule i hereto, and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the securities of the issuer, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees or profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies, or a pledge or contingency the occurrence of which would give another person voting power over the securities of the issuer. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. exhibit number exhibit description 99.1 agreement and plan of merger, dated as of october 15, 2001, by and among motor cargo industries, inc., union pacific corporation and motor merger co.
