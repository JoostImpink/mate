on october 18, 2006, each of pirelli, edizione holding, edizione finance, olimpia, generali and mediobanca entered into the 2006 shareholders agreement relating to, among other things, certain telecom italia shares held by each of olimpia, generali and mediobanca (collectively, the "affected parties") comprising, in aggregate, 23.2% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares. an english translation of the 2006 shareholders agreement is filed as exhibit 1. page 7 of 14 &#160; the 2006 shareholders agreement applies to (i) all of the telecom italia shares held by olimpia, (ii) certain telecom italia shares held by generali (comprising 3.7% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares) and (iii) certain telecom italia shares held by mediobanca (comprising 1.5% of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares). the telecom italia shares that are subject to the 2006 shareholders agreement are referred to below as "affected shares". &#160; the parties to the 2006 shareholders agreement agreed to form a board of representatives (the "shareholders board") which has certain decision-making functions under the agreement. each of generali and mediobanca has (and any additional party that is admitted to the agreement in the future will have) the right to appoint one member to the shareholders board, and olimpia has the right to appoint a number of members equal to the aggregate of the number of all other members of the shareholders board. olimpia will also have the right to appoint the chairman of the shareholders board. the shareholders board will meet prior to each shareholders meeting of telecom italia to discuss all matters that are scheduled to be voted upon by the holders of telecom italia shares at such shareholders meeting. if the members of the shareholders board unanimously agree on how the affected shares shall be voted in relation to a particular matter, then each of the affected parties will be required to vote all of its affected shares in that manner. if the members of the shareholders board do not unanimously agree as to how the affected shares shall be voted, then the affected parties will be free to vote the affected shares held by them at their own discretion. &#160; during the term of the 2006 shareholders agreement, each of the affected parties is prohibited from transferring more than 20% of the number of affected shares that it owns as of the date of the agreement (whether directly, or through derivative or other arrangements that have the effect of transferring the economic risks or benefits associated with the ownership of such shares). &#160; each of mediobanca and generali may acquire additional telecom italia shares, provided that such party does not at any time hold an aggregate number of telecom italia shares that exceeds by more than 25% the number of affected shares held by such party as of the date of execution of the 2006 shareholders agreement. any telecom italia shares so acquired by mediobanca or generali will be deemed affected shares. &#160; no party to the 2006 shareholders agreement may purchase any telecom italia shares without first notifying the shareholders board and the other parties to the agreement. also, each party to the 2006 shareholders agreement must promptly notify the shareholders board and each other party to the agreement in the event that it transfers any telecom italia shares. &#160; under the 2006 shareholders agreement, each of generali and mediobanca has certain rights of first refusal that are triggered in the event that olimpia proposes to transfer all (but not less than all) of its telecom italia shares to any third party. however, such rights of first refusal will not arise if the applicable third party acquiror also offers to acquire the telecom italia shares held by generali and/or mediobanca on the same terms and conditions that it proposes to acquire the telecom italia shares held by olimpia. generali and mediobanca also have rights of first refusal that are triggered in the event that pirelli (whether acting alone or together with edizione finance or edizione holding) proposes to transfer more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of olimpia to a third party. page 8 of 14 &#160; olimpia is required to promptly consult with each of generali and mediobanca if (i) any third party makes an offer to become a shareholder of olimpia by making a capital contribution thereto in the form of telecom italia shares and (ii) such capital contribution would result in olimpia&#8217;s aggregate holding of telecom italia shares being in excess of a certain threshold prescribed under applicable italian law so as to require olimpia to make a mandatory tender offer for telecom italia shares. in that event, generali and mediobanca will have the option to either (i) become shareholders of olimpia by contributing their respective telecom italia shares thereto on the same terms and conditions proposed by the third party or (ii) reduce their respective holdings of telecom italia shares by such amount as may be necessary to ensure that olimpia is not required under applicable italian law to make a tender offer for telecom italia shares. if generali and mediobanca do not (within such reasonable time as olimpia may stipulate) commit to take those actions set forth in either of clauses (i) and (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence, then olimpia may accept the offer of the third party and terminate the shareholders agreement. &#160; the 2006 shareholders agreement has an initial term of three years, and shall automatically be renewed for successive periods of three years unless any party delivers a notice of termination to each other party at least three months prior to the expiration of the then-current term. &#160; the 2006 shareholders agreement provides that holders of 0.5% or more of the total number of issued and outstanding telecom italia shares may be admitted as additional parties to the agreement from time to time with the unanimous consent of the existing parties thereto. &#160; pirelli, edizione holding, edizione finance, generali and mediobanca issued a joint press release concerning the shareholders agreement on october 18, 2006, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 2. &#160;
