junior stock &#148;) until all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on the series c preferred have been paid, unless: &#149; the company obtains the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the series c preferred; or &#149; the company enters into an agreement with any officer, employee or director of the company pursuant to which the company is entitled or required to repurchase shares of common stock or any preferred stock (or options therefore) from such officer, employee or director. in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of each share of series c preferred will be entitled to receive payment per share (the &#147;

will mean the total amount of proceeds that would be payable to the holder of a share of series c preferred upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company if, immediately prior to such event, each outstanding share of series c preferred were deemed to be converted into a number of shares of common stock at the applicable &#147;series c conversion rate.&#148;

charter amendment &#148;) that increases the number of authorized shares of common stock to an amount sufficient for the conversion of series c preferred into common stock at the series c conversion rate. shareholder approval will be needed to effect the charter amendment. the board of directors anticipates taking action to organize a stockholder meeting for this purpose promptly after the closing date. the series c preferred will be automatically converted into common stock at the applicable series c conversion rate in the event that the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding series c preferred elect such conversion; otherwise, a holder of series c may elect to convert some or all of such holder&#146;s shares of series c preferred at the applicable series c conversion rate at any time following the effectiveness of the charter amendment discussed above. the holders of series c preferred will be entitled to vote with the holders of common stock together as a single class on all matters submitted for a vote of the holders of common stock that do not require a separate class vote of the holders of common stock under the company&#146;s certificate of incorporation or applicable law or regulations. each share of series c preferred will entitle the holder thereof to such number of votes per share equal to the initial series c conversion rate (79.5% of the outstanding amount, in the aggregate). in addition, the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series c preferred, voting as a class, will be required to, among other actions by the company or any of its subsidiaries, (i) amend the company&#146;s articles of incorporation or the certificate of designation relating to the series c preferred if such action would adversely affect the rights and preferences of the series c preferred, (ii) authorize, issue or sell new securities other than pursuant to an equity incentive plan, (iii) authorize any liquidation, merger or sale of assets involving $500,000 or more in assets of the company;

relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and each holder of registrable securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 9. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this section 9 shall include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding any provision of this section 9 to the contrary, (a) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation -15- (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation and (b) each holder&#146;s liability hereunder with respect to any particular registration shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such holder from the registrable securities sold by such holder in such registration. 10. eligibility requirements . after the date hereof, the company will make reasonable efforts in good faith to take all steps necessary to ensure that the company will be eligible to register securities on form sb-2, as long as the company is a &#147;small business issuer&#148;, or form s-3 (or any comparable forms adopted by the commission) as soon thereafter as possible, and to make publicly available and available to the holders of registrable securities, pursuant to rule 144 or rule 144a of the commission under the securities act, such information as shall be necessary to enable the holders of registrable securities to make sales of registrable securities pursuant to such rules. the company will furnish to any holder of registrable securities, upon request made by such holder, a written statement signed by the company, addressed to such holder, describing briefly the action the company has taken or proposes to take to comply with the current public information requirements of rule 144 and rule 144a. 11. participation in underwritten registrations .

(b) notwithstanding the priorities set forth in sections 2(c) and 3(b) above, in the event that the managing underwriters in any underwritten demand registration or piggyback registration inform the company in writing that the inclusion therein of any other registrable securities held by management employees of the company or any of its subsidiaries would impair the marketability of the registrable securities to be included in such registration, the company shall be required to include in such registration only such number of other registrable securities held by such management employees as the managing underwriters determine would not negatively impair the registrable securities to be sold in connection therewith. if any such event shall occur, the other holders of registrable securities (other than any holder affected by the restriction described above) shall be entitled to include in such registration, the number of registrable securities that holders of other registrable securities would have been entitled to include in such registration but for such restriction described above (such registrable securities to be allocated pro rata among such other holders on the basis of the number of registrable securities requested to be included therein by each such holder). -16- 12. miscellaneous .
