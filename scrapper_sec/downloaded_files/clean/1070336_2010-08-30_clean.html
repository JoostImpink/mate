section 1 .&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; definitions .&#160;&#160;capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain securities purchase agreement (the &#8220; securities purchase agreement &#8221;), dated august&#160;17, 2010, among the company and the purchasers signatory thereto. &#160; section 2 .&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; exercise . &#160; a) &#160; exercise of warrant.&#160;&#160;exercise of the purchase rights represented by this warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the date of issuance of this warrant and on or before the expiry time by delivery to the principal office of the company of a duly executed copy of the notice of exercise form annexed hereto (or to such other office or agency of the company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered holder at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the company) and the company shall have received payment of the aggregate exercise price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier&#8217;s check drawn on a united states bank (the &#8220;exercise date &#8221;); provided, however, if this warrant is exercised in full, the holder shall have surrendered this warrant to the company within three (3) business days of the date the notice of exercise is delivered to the company.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the holder shall not be required to physically surrender this warrant to the company until the holder has purchased all of the warrant shares available hereunder and the warrant has been exercised in full.&#160;&#160;partial exercises of this warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of warrant shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of warrant shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of warrant shares purchased.&#160;&#160;the holder and the company shall maintain records showing the number of warrant shares purchased and the date of such purchases.&#160;&#160;the company shall deliver any objection to any notice of exercise form wi thin two (2) business days of receipt of such notice.&#160;&#160;the holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the warrant shares hereunder, the number of warrant shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; immediately prior to the expiry time, the portion of this warrant not exercised prior thereto shall automatically be deemed to be exercised in full in the manner set forth in section 2(c), without any further action on behalf of the holder; provided, however, that in the event that the cashless exercise formula set forth in section 2(c) yields a result that is less than or equal to zero, then the unexercised portion of this warrant shall automatically terminate and become void.&#160;&#160;the company may not call or redeem any portion of this warrant without the prior written consent of the affected holder. &#160; b) &#160; exercise price .&#160;&#160;the exercise price of the common stock under this warrant shall be $3.1125 per share, subject to adjustment hereunder. &#160; c) &#160; cashless exercise .&#160;&#160;this warrant may also be exercised by means of a &#8220;cashless exercise&#8221; in which the holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of warrant shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(a-b)*(x)] by (a), where: &#160; &#160; (a) = the vwap on the trading day immediately preceding the date of such election; &#160; &#160; (b) = the exercise price of this warrant, as adjusted; and &#160; &#160; (x) = the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant in accordance with the terms of this warrant by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise. &#160; the &#8220; vwap &#8221; means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a) if the common stock is then listed or quoted on a trading market, the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the trading market on which the common stock is then listed or quoted as reported by bloomberg financial l.p. (based on a trading day from 9:30 a.m.&#160;&#160;eastern time to 4:02 p.m.&#160;&#160;eastern time); (b) the volume weighted average price of the common stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the otc bulletin board or (c) if the common stock is not then listed or quoted on the otc bulletin board and if prices for the common stock are then reported in the & #8220;pink sheets&#8221; published by the pink sheets, llc (or a similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the common stock so reported; or (d) in all other cases, the fair market value of a share of common stock as determined by a good faith determination of the company&#8217;s board of directors. &#160; d) &#160; percentage limitation .&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the company shall not issue to any holder any shares of common stock, including pursuant to any rights herein, including, without limitation, any exercise rights, to the extent such shares, when added to the number of shares of common stock then beneficially owned by such holder and any persons whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with such holder for purposes of section 13(d) of the securities exchange act, would cause the total number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such holder and any such persons to exceed 19.999% of the total number of out standing shares of common stock of the company at the time of such issuance (the &#8220; maximum aggregate share amount &#8221;), provided, however, that this section 2(d) shall not apply to the exercise of this warrant in connection with any fundamental transaction (as defined below) in which the company is acquired by a third party, whether by merger or stock purchase.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 2(d), beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with section 13(d) of the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.&#160;&#160;if on any attempted exercise of this warrant other than in connection with a fundamental transaction, the issuance of warrant shares would exceed the maximum aggregate share amount, then the company shall issue to the holder requesting a warrant exercise such number of warrant shares as may be issued below the maximum aggregate share amount and, with respect to the remainder of the aggregate number of warrant shares, this warrant shall remain exercisable, subject to this section 2(d).&#160;&#160;notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 2(d), the limitations contained herein shall not apply unless (i) such limitations are required under nasdaq global market rule 5635 or (ii) the holder has, by providing the company with written notice, lowered the maximum aggregate share amount to a percentage below 19.999% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock (such amount being the &#8220; adjusted maximum aggregate share amount &#8221;).&#160;&#160;upon providing the company with at least 61 days prior written notice, the holder may increase the adjusted maximum aggregate share amount up to 19.999% of the shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, provided, however, that in the event that nasdaq global market rule 5635 does not require the limitati ons contained in this section 2(c), the holder may increase the adjusted maximum aggregate share amount above 19.999% of the shares common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; e) &#160; mechanics of exercise . &#160; i. &#160; authorization of warrant shares.&#160;&#160;the company covenants that all warrant shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this warrant and payment to the company of the purchase price therefor, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). &#160; ii. &#160; delivery of certificates upon exercise.&#160;&#160;certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the transfer agent of the company to the holder by crediting the account of the holder&#8217;s prime broker with the depository trust company through its deposit withdrawal agent commission (&#8220;dwac&#8221;) system if the company is a participant in such system, and otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the holder in the notice of exercise within three (3) trading days from the delivery to the company of the notice of exercise form, surrender of this warrant (if required) and payment of the aggregate exercise price (unless exercised by means of a cashless exercise pursuant to section 2(c) ) (&#8220;warrant share delivery date&#8221;).&#160;&#160;this warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date the exercise price is received by the company (or in the case of a cashless exercise pursuant to section 2(c), the date this warrant is surrendered).&#160;&#160;if all or any part of a warrant is exercised at a time when there is an effective registration statement to cover the issuance or resale of the warrant shares and if the legend is not required under applicable securities laws, such warrant shares shall be issued free of all legends on or before the warrant share delivery date.&#160;&#160;the warrant shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the exercise date irrespective of the date such warrant shares are credited to the holder&#8217;s dwac account, or the date of delivery of certificates evidencing the warrant shares, as the case may be. &#160; iii. &#160; delivery of new warrants upon exercise .&#160;&#160;if this warrant shall have been exercised in part, the company shall, at the request of a holder and upon surrender of this warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing warrant shares, deliver to holder a new warrant evidencing the rights of holder to purchase the unpurchased warrant shares called for by this warrant, which new warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this warrant. &#160; iv. &#160; no fractional shares or scrip .&#160;&#160;no fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this warrant.&#160;&#160;as to any fraction of a share that holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the exercise price. &#160; v. &#160; charges, taxes and expenses .&#160;&#160;issuance of certificates for warrant shares shall be made without charge to the holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the holder; provided, however, that in the event certificates for warrant shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the holder, this warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the assignment form attached hereto duly executed by the h older; and the company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; f) &#160; the company&#8217;s obligations to issue and deliver warrant shares in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the holder or any other person of any obligation to the company or any violation or alleged violation of law by the holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the company to the holder in connection with the i ssuance of warrant shares.&#160;&#160;nothing herein shall limit a holder&#8217;s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the company&#8217;s failure to timely deliver the warrant shares upon exercise of the warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. &#160; section 3 .&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; certain adjustments . &#160; a) &#160; stock dividends and splits .&#160;&#160;if the company, at any time while this warrant is outstanding: (a) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its common stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of common stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of common stock issued by the company pursuant to this warrant), (b) subdivides outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares, (c) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares, or (d) issues by reclassification of shares of th e common stock any shares of capital stock of the company, then in each case the exercise price shall be multiplied by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be proportionately adjusted in an inverse manner (e.g., an increase in the exercise price shall result in a decrease in the number of shares of common stock).&#160;&#160;any adjustment made pursuant to this section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. &#160; g) &#160; pro rata distributions .&#160;&#160;if the company, at any time prior to the expiry time, shall declare, or distribute any dividend or other distribution to all holders of common stock (and not to holders of the warrants) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the common stock, then in each such case the exercise price shall be adjusted by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, of which the denominator shall be the vwap determin ed as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such vwap on such record date less the then per share fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of the common stock as determined by the board of directors of the company in good faith.&#160;&#160;the adjustment shall be described in a statement provided to the holder.&#160;&#160;such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above. &#160; h) &#160; fundamental transaction; automatic exercise .&#160;&#160;if, at any time while this warrant is outstanding, the company effects (a) any merger or consolidation of the company with or into another person (an &#8220; acquisition &#8221;), (b) any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions (an &#8220; asset sale &#8221;), (c) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the company or another person) pursuant to which holders of common stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property (a &#8220; tender offer &#8221;), or (d) any reclassification of the common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a &#8220; fundamental transaction &#8221;), then, this warrant shall remain outstanding according to its terms except that, upon any subsequent exercise of this warrant, the holder shall have the right to receive, for each warrant share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such fundamental transaction, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the &#8220; alternate consideration &#8221;) receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the fundamental transaction is in the form of an acquisition, asset sale or tender offer, and the consideration payable with respect to such transaction is cash (a &#8220; cash transaction &#8221;), then holder shall exercise its conversion or purchase right under this warrant and such exercise will be deemed effective immediately prior to the consummation of such cash transaction, and, if holder does not so exercise, this warrant shall automatically be exercised pursuant to section 2(c) hereof, without any action by holder immediately prior to the consumma tion of such cash transaction.&#160;&#160;the company shall provide the holder with written notice of its request relating to the foregoing (together with such reasonable information as the holder may request in connection with such contemplated acquisition giving rise to such notice), which is to be delivered to holder not less than ten (10) days prior to the closing of the proposed cash transaction.&#160;&#160;the provisions of section 2(d) shall apply to any such exercise.&#160;&#160;to the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the company or surviving entity in such fundamental transaction shall issue to the holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the holder&#8217;s right to exercise such warrant for the alternate consideration.&#160;&#160;the terms of any agreement pursuant to which a fundamental transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this sectio n 3(c) and insuring that this warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a fundamental transaction. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; i) &#160; calculations .&#160;&#160;all calculations under this section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.&#160;&#160;for purposes of this section 3, the number of shares of common stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of common stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. &#160; j) &#160; notice to holders . &#160; i. &#160; adjustment to exercise price .&#160;&#160;whenever the exercise price is adjusted pursuant to this section 3, the company shall promptly mail to each holder a notice setting forth the exercise price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. &#160; ii. &#160; notice to allow exercise by holder .&#160;&#160;if (a) the company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on the common stock; (b) the company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the common stock; (c) the company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the common stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights; (d) the approval of any stockholders of the company shall be required in connection with any fundamental transaction;

provided, that the failure of any i ndemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have materially prejudiced the indemnifying party. &#160; an indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless: (1) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the indemnifying party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in any such proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified party and the indemn ifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party).&#160;&#160;the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.&#160;&#160;no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. &#160;

provided, that the indemnified party shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying party for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for which it is finally judicially determined (not subject to appeal) such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, determined based upon the relative faults of the parties. &#160; (d) &#160; contribution .&#160;&#160;if the indemnification under section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party for any reason or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless for any losses, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. &#160; the relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties&#8217; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission.&#160;&#160;the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this agreement, any reasonable attorneys&#8217; or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. &#160; the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.&#160;&#160;notwithstanding the provisions of this section 5(d), in no event shall any selling holder be required to contribute an amount under this section 5(d) in excess of the net proceeds received by such holder upon sale of such holder&#8217;s registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement giving rise to such contribution obligation, except in the case of fraud by such holder. &#160; the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this section are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying parties may have to the indemnified parties. &#160; 6. &#160; reports under exchange act .&#160;&#160;with a view to making available to the holder the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the securities act and any other rule or regulation of the commission that may at any time permit a holder to sell registrable shares of the company to the public without registration, the company agrees to: &#160;

8. &#160; miscellaneous . &#160; (a) &#160; remedies .&#160;&#160;in the event of a breach by the company or by a holder, of any of their obligations under this agreement, each holder or the company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this agreement.&#160;&#160;the company and each holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. &#160; (b) &#160; no piggyback on holder registrations .&#160;&#160;no person has any right to cause the company to effect a registration under the securities act of any securities of the company or to include securities of the company in the mandatory registration statement other than the registrable securities, except for rights that have been duly waived.&#160;&#160;neither the company nor any of its security holders (other than the holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the company in the mandatory registration statement other than the registrable securities. &#160; (c) &#160; compliance .&#160;&#160;each holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act as applicable to it in connection with sales of registrable securities pursuant to a registration statement. &#160; (d) &#160; discontinued disposition .&#160;&#160;each holder agrees by its acquisition of such registrable securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in section 3(c), such holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such registrable securities under a registration statement until such holder&#8217;s receipt of the copies of the supplemented prospectus and/or amended registration statement, or until it is advised in writing (the &#8220; advice &#8221;) by the company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such prospectus or registration statement.&#160;&#160;the company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the prospectus may be resumed as promptly as it practicable.&#160;&#160;the company agrees and acknowledges that any periods during which the holder is required to discontinue the disposition of the registrable securities hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of section 2(d). &#160; (e) &#160; piggy-back registrations .&#160;&#160;if at any time during the period from the closing date (as defined in the purchase agreement) to the second anniversary of the closing date, any registrable securities are not able to be resold pursuant to an effective registration statement and the company shall determine to prepare and file with the commission a registration statement relating to an underwritten offering or a &#8220;registered direct&#8221; offering to be placed by a placement agent, either for the company&#8217;s own account or the account of others under the securities act of any of its equity securities, other than on form s-4 or form s-8 (each as promulgate d under the securities act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the company shall send to the holder written notice of such determination and, if within ten days after receipt of such notice, the holder shall so request in writing, the company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of the registrable securities such holder requests to be registered, subject to customary underwriter or placement agent cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights, if any, due to a reasonable objection from the underwriters or placement agents that the inclusion of such registrable securities would materially adversely affect the contemplated offering;

company &#8221;) and any of their pledges, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the trading market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions.&#160;&#160;these sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices.&#160;&#160;a selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; privately negotiated transactions; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; a combination of any such methods of sale; &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; or &#160; &#183;&#160;&#160; any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. &#160; the selling stockholders may also sell shares under rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220; securities act &#8221;), if available, rather than under this prospectus.&#160;&#160;the selling stockholders have the sole and absolute discretion not to accept any purchase offer or make any sale of shares if they deem the purchase price to be unsatisfactory at any particular time. &#160; broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales.&#160;&#160;broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with nasdr rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with nasdr im-2440. &#160; in connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume.&#160;&#160;the selling stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities.&#160;&#160;the selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, w hich shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; the selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be &#8220;underwriters&#8221; within the meaning of the securities act in connection with such sales.&#160;&#160;in such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the securities act each selling stockholder has informed the company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. &#160; the company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the company incident to the registration of the shares.&#160;&#160;the company has agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the securities act. &#160; [ because selling stockholders may be deemed to be &#8220;underwriters&#8221; within the meaning of the securities act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act. ] in addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act may be sold under rule 144 rather than under this prospectus.&#160;&#160;each selling stockholder has advised us that they have not entered into any written or oral agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriter or broker-dealer regarding the sale of the resale shares.&#160;&#160;there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the selling stockholders. &#160; we agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date all of the registrable securities covered by such registration statement have been sold and (ii) the later of (a) the second anniversary of the effectiveness date or (b) the date upon which the registrable securities may be sold without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions under rule 144 as determined by the counsel to the company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the company&#8217;s transfer agent and the affected holders.&#160;&#160;the resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws.&#160;&#160;in addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the appl icable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. &#160; under applicable rules and regulations under the exchange act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in regulation m, prior to the commencement of the distribution.&#160;&#160;in addition, the selling stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including regulation m, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the selling stockholders or any other person.&#160;&#160;we will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale. &#160;

to the purchasers named on &#160;&#160; schedule a attached hereto &#160; re: securities purchase agreement by and between achillion pharmaceuticals, inc. and the purchasers named on the signature pages thereto &#160; ladies and gentlemen: &#160; this opinion is being furnished pursuant to section 2.3(b)(iii)(a) of the securities purchase agreement, dated as of august [&#9679;], 2010 (the &#8220;agreement&#8221;), by and among achillion pharmaceuticals, inc., a delaware corporation (the &#8220;company&#8221;), and each of the persons identified in the agreement as a &#8220;purchasers&#8221; (each of whom is named on schedule a attached hereto (collectively, the &#8220;purchasers&#8221; and individually, a &#8220;purchaser&#8221;)).&#160;&#160;capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the agreement. &#160; we have acted as counsel to the company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the agreement, the registration rights agreement and the common warrants (the &#8220;transaction documents&#8221;).&#160;&#160;as such counsel, we have examined and are familiar with and have relied upon the following documents: &#160; 1. &#160; the certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of the company; &#160; 2. &#160; a certificate of the secretary of state of the state of delaware, dated august [&#9679;], 2010, attesting to the continued legal existence and corporate good standing of the company in delaware (the &#8220;domestic certificate&#8221;); &#160; 3. &#160; a certificate of the secretary of state of the state of connecticut, dated august [&#9679;], 2010, attesting to the good standing and due qualification of the company to transact business in the state of connecticut (the &#8220;foreign qualification certificate&#8221;); &#160; 4. &#160; the transaction documents; and &#160; 5. &#160; a secretary&#8217;s certificate from the company, dated as of the date hereof (the &#8220;secretary&#8217;s certificate&#8221;), attesting to the company&#8217;s charter and by-laws, certain resolutions adopted by the board of directors of the company and as to certain other matters. &#160; in our examination of the documents described above, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individual signatories, the completeness of all corporate and stock records provided to us, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; in rendering this opinion, we have relied, as to all questions of fact material to this opinion, upon certificates of public officials and officers of the company and upon the representations and warranties made by the purchasers and the company in the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;we have not attempted to verify independently such facts.&#160;&#160;we have not conducted a search of any electronic databases or the dockets of any court, administrative or regulatory body, agency or other filing office in any jurisdiction. &#160; for purposes of this opinion, we have assumed that the transaction documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all parties thereto other than the company, and that all such other parties have all requisite power and authority to effect the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;we have also assumed that each transaction document is the valid and binding obligation of each party thereto other than the company and is enforceable against such other parties in accordance with its terms.&#160;&#160;we do not render any opinion as to the application of any federal or state law or regulation to the power, authority or competence of any party to the transaction documents other than the company. &#160; for purposes of this opinion we have assumed that the board of directors of the company has complied with its fiduciary duties in connection with the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;we have also assumed for the purposes of section 144 of the dgcl &#160; (as defined below) that the transaction documents are fair as to the company as of the time they were authorized, approved or ratified by the board of directors of the company or a committee thereof. &#160; our opinions set forth below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) statutory or decisional law concerning recourse by creditors to security in the absence of notice or hearing, (iii) duties and standards imposed on creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and (iv) general equitable principles.&#160;&#160;we express no opinion as to the availability of any equitable or specific remedy upon any breach of any of the agreements as to which we are opining herein, or any of the agreements, documents or obligations referred to therein, or to the successful a ssertion of any equitable defenses, inasmuch as the availability of such remedies or the success of any equitable defense may be subject to the discretion of a court.&#160;&#160;we are expressing no opinion herein as to the enforceability of any securities law indemnification and contribution provisions in the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;we are expressing no opinion herein with respect to compliance by the company with state securities or &#8220;blue sky&#8221; laws, or with any state or federal securities antifraud laws. &#160; we also express no opinion herein as to any provision of any agreement (a) which may be deemed to or construed to waive any right of the company, (b) to the effect that rights and remedies are not exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to or with any other right or remedy and does not preclude recourse to one or more other rights or remedies, (c) relating to the effect of invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the transaction documents on the validity or enforceability of any other provision thereof, (d) requiring the payment of penalties, consequential damages or liquidated damages, (e) which is in violation of public policy, including, without limitation, any provision relating to indemnification and contribution with respect to securities law matters, (f) purporting to indemn ify any person against his, her or its own negligence or intentional misconduct, (g) which provides that the terms of the transaction documents may not be waived or modified except in writing or (h) relating to choice of law or consent to jurisdiction. &#160; our opinions expressed in paragraph 1 below, insofar as they relate to the valid existence, due qualification and good standing of the company, are based solely on the domestic certificate and the foreign qualification certificate and are limited accordingly, and, as to such matters, our opinions are rendered as of the respective dates of such certificates.&#160;&#160;we express no opinion as to the tax good standing of the company in any jurisdiction. &#160; for purposes of our opinions in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, we have relied upon representations made by the purchasers in section 3.2 of the agreement, and have assumed (without any independent investigation) the accuracy of such representations.&#160;&#160;for purposes of our opinions in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, we have also assumed that in connection with the offer and sale of securities to the purchasers, neither the company nor any person acting on its behalf has engaged in any form of &#8220;general solicitation or general advertising&#8221; within the meaning contemplated by rule 502 (c) of regulation d. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; we are opining herein solely as to the state laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts, the delaware general corporation law statute (the &#8220;dgcl&#8221;) and the federal laws of the united states of america.&#160;&#160;to the extent that any other laws govern any of the matters as to which we are opining below, we have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation, that such laws are identical to the state laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts, and we express no opinion as to whether such assumption is reasonable or correct. &#160; for purposes of our opinions rendered below, we have assumed that the facts and law governing the future performance by the company of its obligations under the transaction documents will be identical to the facts and law governing its performance on the date of this opinion. &#160; based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: &#160; 1. &#160; the company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the sec reports, and to carry out the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;the company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the state of connecticut. &#160; 2. &#160; immediately prior to the closing, the authorized capital stock of the company consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. &#160; 3. &#160; the closing securities have been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the purchasers pursuant to the agreement and, when issued and delivered by the company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the agreement will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.&#160;&#160;the common warrant shares have been duly and validly authorized and reserved for issuance and upon exercise of the common warrants, in accordance with their terms, including the payment of any exercise price therefor, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. &#160; 4. &#160; the execution and delivery by the company of the transaction documents, and the consummation by the company of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the company, and the transaction documents have been duly executed and delivered by the company.&#160;&#160;each of the transaction documents constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the company, enforceable against the company in accordance with its terms. &#160; 5. &#160; the execution and delivery by the company of the transaction documents, and the consummation by the company of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not (a) subject to the required approvals and based in part on the representations and warranties in section 3.2 of the agreement, violate the provisions of any u.s.&#160;&#160;federal law, rule or regulation applicable to the company or the dgcl; (b) violate the provisions of the company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or by-laws, each as amended to date; or (c) with or without notice and/or the passage of time, conflict with or result in the breach or termination of any term or provision of, or constitute a default under, or cause the creation of any lien, charge or encumbr ance upon the properties or assets of the company pursuant to, any agreement to which the company is a party and which is attached as an exhibit to the company&#8217;s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2009 and any current or periodic reports filed by the company since the date of such annual report on forms 8-k or 10-q. &#160; 6. &#160; the company is not required under applicable united states federal law or the dgcl to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any court or other governmental authority or agency in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the company of the transaction documents, other than the required approvals. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7. &#160; the company is not, and is not an affiliate of, and immediately after receipt of payment for the securities, will not be or be an affiliate of, an &#8220;investment company&#8221; within the meaning of the investment company act of 1940, as amended. &#160; 8. &#160; based in part on the representations of each of the purchasers in section 3.2 of the agreement, the offer, issuance and sale of the shares pursuant to the agreement are exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended. &#160; this opinion is provided to the purchasers as a legal opinion only and not as a guaranty or warranty of the matters discussed herein.&#160;&#160;this opinion is based upon currently existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions and is rendered as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of the foregoing sources of law or subsequent developments in law or changes in facts or circumstances which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein. &#160; this opinion is rendered only to the purchasers and is solely for the benefit of the purchasers in connection with the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents.&#160;&#160;this opinion may not be relied upon by the purchasers for any other purpose, nor may this opinion be provided to, quoted to or relied upon by any other person or entity for any purpose without our prior written consent. &#160;
