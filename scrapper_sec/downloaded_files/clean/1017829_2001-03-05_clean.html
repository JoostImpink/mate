(b) to the extent permitted by law, each investor participating in such registration will, if the shares are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the securities act, the exchange act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such investor under an instrument duly executed by investor and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and such investor will pay as incurred any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially 18 page 40 of 50 determined that there was such a violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this section 6.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity payable by any investor under this section 6.7 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such investor.

(d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 6.7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided that in no event shall any contribution by an investor hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such investor. (e) the obligations of the company and each investor under this section 6.7 shall survive completion of any offering of the shares in a registration statement and the termination of this agreement. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof 19 page 41 of 50 the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation and (ii) does include a non-monetary remedy. 6.8 assignment of registration rights. the rights to cause the company to register the shares pursuant to this section 6 may be assigned by an investor to a transferee or assignee of the shares which (a) is a subsidiary, parent, general partner, limited partner, retired partner, member or retired member or affiliate of such investor, (b) is investor's family member or trust for the benefit of an individual investor or (c) acquires at least one million (1,000,000) of the shares (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations) or all of the shares held by such investor, if less; provided, however, (i) the transferor shall, within 10 days after such transfer, furnish to the company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee shall agree to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this agreement. 6.9 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available to each investor the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may permit the sale of the shares to the public without registration, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 promulgated under the securities act or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the securities act, at all times while a class of the company's securities is registered under section 12(g) of the exchange act; (b) file with the sec, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the company under the exchange act; and (c) so long as an investor owns shares, furnish to such investor forthwith upon request: a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said rule 144 of the securities act and of the exchange act; a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company; and such other reports and documents as such investor may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing it to sell any such securities without registration. 7. miscellaneous. 7.1 governing law. this agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of colorado as such laws are applied to agreements between colorado residents entered into and performed entirely in colorado. 7.2 survival. other than as set forth in section 6 hereof, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made herein shall survive any investigation made by an investor or the company and the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of 18 months after the date hereof, provided that the covenants of the company set forth in section 6 shall survive indefinitely so long as any investor holds any shares. all statements as to factual matters contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the company or an investor pursuant hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be representations and warranties by the company or an investor, respectively, hereunder solely as of the date of such certificate or instrument. 20 page 42 of 50 7.3 successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each person who shall be a holder of the shares from time to time. 7.4 entire agreement. this agreement, the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subjects hereof and no party shall be liable or bound to any other in any manner by any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements except as specifically set forth herein and therein. 7.5 severability. in case any provision of the agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 7.6 amendment and waiver.
