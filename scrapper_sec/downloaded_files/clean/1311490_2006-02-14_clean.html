(d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 7.3 is required by its terms but is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this section 7.3 in respect to any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and the purchaser from the private placement of common stock hereunder or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but the relative fault of the company and the purchaser in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties in this agreement and/or the registration statement which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the respective relative benefits received by the -19- company on the one hand and each purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the amount paid by such purchaser to the company pursuant to this agreement for the shares purchased by such purchaser that were sold pursuant to the registration statement bears to the difference (the &#147;difference&#148;) between the amount such purchaser paid for the shares that were sold pursuant to the registration statement and the amount received by such purchaser from such sale. the relative fault of the company, on the one hand, and each purchaser on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or the inaccurate or the alleged inaccurate representation and/or warranty relates to information supplied by the company or by such purchaser and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (c) of this section 7.3, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. the provisions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section 7.3 with respect to the notice of the threat or commencement of any threat or action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this paragraph (d); provided , however , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any threat or action for which notice has been given under paragraph (c) for purposes of indemnification. the company and each purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 7.3 were determined solely by pro rata allocation (even if the purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 7.3, no purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the difference exceeds the amount of any damages that such purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the purchasers&#146; obligations to contribute pursuant to this section 7.3 are several and not joint. (e) absent fraud or willful or intentional misconduct, the indemnification and contribution provided by the company and the purchaser pursuant to sections 7.3(a), (b) and (d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein. the amount of any payment by the company under this section 7 in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from or arising out of any indemnification or contribution claim made pursuant to section 7.3(a) or section 7.3(d) shall in no event exceed the gross proceeds to the company as a result of the sale of the securities hereunder. the amount of any payment by the purchaser under this section 7 in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from or arising out of any indemnification or contribution claim made pursuant to section 7.3(b) or section 7.3(d) shall in no event exceed the gross proceeds to such purchaser as a result of the sale of the shares and the warrant shares pursuant to the registration statement. 7.4 termination of conditions and obligations . the restrictions imposed by section 5 or this section 7 upon the transferability of the securities shall cease and -20- terminate as to any particular number of the securities (including the warrant shares) upon the passage of two years from the effective date of the registration statement covering such securities or at such time as an opinion of counsel satisfactory in form and substance to the company shall have been rendered to the effect that such conditions are not necessary in order to comply with the securities act. 7.5 information available . so long as the registration statement is effective covering the resale of registrable securities owned by the purchaser: (a) the company will furnish to the purchaser: (i) as soon as practicable after available (but in the case of the annual report to the stockholders, within 150 days after the end of each fiscal year of the company), one copy of (a) its annual report to stockholders (which annual report shall contain financial statements audited in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by a national firm of certified public accountants), (b) if not included in substance in the annual report to stockholders, upon the written request of the purchaser, its annual report on form 10-k, (c) upon the written request of the purchaser, its quarterly reports on form 10-q, and (d) a full copy of the particular registration statement covering the registrable securities (the foregoing, in each case, excluding exhibits);

and (b) the company, upon the reasonable written request of the purchaser and with reasonable prior notice, will be available to the purchaser or a representative thereof at the company&#146;s headquarters to discuss information relevant for disclosure in the registration statement covering the registrable securities and will otherwise cooperate with any purchaser conducting an investigation for the purpose of reducing or eliminating such purchaser&#146;s exposure to liability under the securities act, including the reasonable production of information at the company&#146;s headquarters, in a manner not to interfere with the normal business operations of the company, subject to appropriate confidentiality limitations. 7.6 delay in filing or effectiveness of registration statement . if the registration statement is not filed by the company with the commission on or prior to the filing date, then for each day following the filing date, until but excluding the date the registration statement is filed, or if the registration statement is not declared effective by the commission by the required effective date, then for each day following the required effective date, until but excluding the date the commission declares the registration statement effective, the company shall, for each such day, pay the purchaser with respect to any such failure, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 0.0333% of the purchase price paid by such purchaser for its securities pursuant to this agreement; and for any such day, such payment shall be made no later than the first business day of the calendar month next succeeding the month in which such day occurs. if the purchaser shall be prohibited from selling registrable securities under the registration statement as a result of a suspension of more than sixty (60) consecutive days or suspensions of more than ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any 12-month period, then for each day on which a suspension is in effect that exceeds the maximum allowed period for a suspension or suspensions, but not including any day on which a -21- suspension is lifted, the company shall pay the purchaser, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 0.0333% of the purchase price paid by such purchaser for its securities pursuant to this agreement for each such day, and such payment shall be made no later than the first business day of the calendar month next succeeding the month in which such day occurs. for purposes of this section 7.6, a suspension shall be deemed lifted on the date that notice that the suspension has been lifted is delivered to the purchaser pursuant to section 9 of this agreement. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the company be obligated to pay such liquidated damages (a) to more than one purchaser in respect of the same securities for the same period of time or (b) in an aggregate amount that exceeds 10% of the purchase price paid by such purchase for its securities pursuant to this agreement. such payments shall be made to the purchaser in cash. section 8. fees 8.1 broker&#146;s fee . the purchaser acknowledges that the company intends to pay to the placement agents a fee in respect of the sale of the securities to the purchaser. the purchaser and the company hereby agree that the purchaser shall not be responsible for such fee and that the company will indemnify and hold harmless the purchaser and each purchaser/affiliate against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several, to which such purchaser or purchaser/affiliate may become subject with respect to such fee. each of the parties hereto hereby represents that, on the basis of any actions and agreements by it, there are no other brokers or finders entitled to compensation in connection with the sale of the securities to the purchaser. 8.2 other fees. the company shall, at the closing, reimburse the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of gunderson dettmer stough villeneuve franklin &#038;
