the following descriptions do not purport to cover all of the provisions of the stockholder agreement or the registration rights agreement and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements, which have been filed as exhibits 7(a) and 7(b) hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. stockholder agreement representation of liberty on the live nation board of directors after the merger .&#160; the stockholder agreement provides that, effective upon the closing of the merger until such time as liberty no longer beneficially owns shares of common stock representing at least 50% of the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by liberty immediately after the merger (or, if sooner, following the second anniversary of the merger, the date liberty&#146;s beneficial ownership of common stock falls below 5% of the total voting power of live nation&#146;s equity securities), liberty has the right to nominate up to two directors to serve on the board of directors of live nation.&#160; pursuant to the stockholder agreement, live nation (i) effective as of the closing of the merger, 5 caused (a) john c. malone, the chairman of the board of directors of liberty, and mark carleton, a senior vice president of liberty, the two liberty designees, to be appointed to the board of directors of live nation, and (b) the entire board of directors of live nation to be comprised of fourteen (14) directors, (ii) will cause each person that liberty nominates following the merger to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the board of directors of live nation to the stockholders of live nation for election as directors at each annual meeting of stockholders at which such director&#146;s term expires, and (iii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such liberty designee, including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such designees.&#160; liberty has the right to designate a replacement director to the board of directors of live nation in order to fill any vacancy of a director previously designated by liberty. one of liberty&#146;s nominees serving on the board of directors of live nation must qualify as &#147;independent&#148; under applicable stock exchange rules.&#160; in addition, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, liberty may require that one of its designees be appointed to serve on the audit committee of the live nation board of directors and one of its designees be appointed to serve on the compensation committee of the live nation board of directors, so long as, in each case, such designee meets the independence requirements of the applicable stock exchange to be appointed to such committee.&#160; in connection with the completion of the merger on january 25, 2010, mr. carleton was appointed to serve on the compensation committee of the live nation board of directors and liberty did not designate a director for the audit committee of the live nation board of directors.&#160; in addition, pursuant to the stockholder agreement, the nominating and/or governance committee of the live nation board of directors may include only &#147;qualified directors,&#148; who are directors other than any who (i) were nominated by liberty, (ii) are officers or employees of live nation or (iii) were not nominated by the nominating and/or governance committee of the live nation board of directors in their initial election to the live nation board of directors and for whose election liberty voted shares. share acquisition restrictions and governance matters .&#160; pursuant to the stockholder agreement, liberty has agreed to not acquire (except acquisitions made pursuant to rights offerings or similar offerings generally available to holders of equity securities of live nation) beneficial ownership of any equity securities of live nation unless after giving effect to such acquisition, liberty&#146;s voting power of live nation would not exceed the applicable percentage.&#160; the &#147;applicable percentage&#148; initially is 35% and will be reduced for specified transfers of equity securities of live nation by liberty.&#160; in the event that liberty&#146;s beneficial ownership exceeds the applicable percentage, liberty is not permitted under the stockholder agreement to vote any of the equity securities of live nation beneficially owned by liberty in excess of the applicable percentage on any matter submitted to a vote of live nation stockholders. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, live nation has approved liberty, its affiliates and certain transferees of all of liberty&#146;s interest in live nation as an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, thereby exempting such persons&#146; acquisition of live nation equity securities from the restrictions on &#147;business combinations&#148; set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.&#160; in addition, live nation amended its stockholder rights plan to permit liberty and its affiliates to acquire voting equity securities of the company up to the applicable percentage without triggering the distribution of rights under such plan and agreed (i) upon notice of certain permitted transfers of live nation equity securities described below, to amend the live nation stockholder rights plan to permit such permitted transferee to acquire live nation equity securities up to the applicable percentage in effect with respect to such transferee and (ii) not to take certain actions that would materially adversely affect liberty&#146;s ability to acquire live nation equity securities up to the applicable percentage. transfer of rights under the liberty stockholder agreement; adjustment of liberty&#146;s applicable percentage .&#160; under certain circumstances, if a transferee of liberty&#146;s live nation equity securities agrees to be bound by the stockholder agreement, certain rights and obligations under the stockholder agreement may be transferred by liberty to such transferee. if liberty transfers live nation equity securities to one of liberty&#146;s affiliates and such entity thereafter ceases to be a liberty affiliate as a result of a spin-off transaction, all of the rights and obligations of liberty under the stockholder agreement will apply to such entity, including the rights to board representation described above. 6 in that event, the applicable percentage then in effect will apply to the spun-off liberty affiliate and thereafter the applicable percentage attributable to liberty media will be 5%.&#160; if, however, liberty transfers live nation equity securities to one of liberty&#146;s affiliates and no spin-off transaction occurs, then liberty media will retain all of the rights to board representation provided by the liberty stockholder agreement. if liberty transfers all of its live nation equity securities to a third party who, after such transfer, does not own live nation equity securities in excess of the applicable percentage, then all of the rights and obligations of liberty under the stockholder agreement (other than the rights to board representation described above) will apply to such transferee.&#160; in that event, the applicable percentage prior to such transfer will apply to such third-party transferee and thereafter the applicable percentage attributable to liberty will be 0%.&#160; the rights and obligations of liberty under the stockholder agreement may only be transferred to a third party twice, which transfers are in addition to the transfer of live nation equity securities in connection with the spin-off of a liberty affiliate as described above. live nation registration rights agreement pursuant to the registration rights agreement, liberty and its permitted transferees (the &#147;holders&#148;) are entitled to three demand registration rights (and unlimited piggyback registration rights) in respect of the shares of common stock received by liberty in the merger and other shares acquired by liberty consistent with the stockholder agreement (collectively, the &#147;registrable shares&#148;).&#160; the holders will be permitted to exercise their registration rights in connection with, among other things, certain hedging transactions that they may enter into in respect of the registrable shares.&#160; live nation will be obligated to indemnify the holders, and each selling holder will be obligated to indemnify the issuer, against certain liabilities in connection with misstatements or omissions in any registration statement. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits 7(a) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
