provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such lender to receive the compensation so requested. each lender shall promptly notify the borrower and the administrative agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such lender to compensation pursuant to this section 3.9 and will designate a different applicable lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. any lender claiming compensation under this section 3.9 shall furnish to the borrower and the administrative agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. in determining such amount, such lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 3.10 treatment of affected loans. if the obligation of any lender to make any eurodollar loan or to continue, or to convert base rate loans into, eurodollar loans shall be suspended pursuant to section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such lender's eurodollar loans shall be automatically converted into base rate loans on the last day(s) of the then current interest period(s) for such eurodollar loans (or, in the case of a conversion, on such earlier date as such lender may specify to the borrower with a copy to the administrative agent) and, unless and until such lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist: (a) to the extent that such lender's eurodollar loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such lender's eurodollar loans shall be applied instead to its base rate loans; and (b) all loans that would otherwise be made or continued by such lender as eurodollar loans shall be made or continued instead as base rate loans, and all base rate loans of such lender that would otherwise be converted into eurodollar loans shall remain as base rate loans. if such lender gives notice to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent) that the circumstances specified in section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such lender's eurodollar loans pursuant to this section 3.10 no longer exist (which such lender agrees 55 to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when eurodollar loans made by other lenders are outstanding, such lender's base rate loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding interest period(s) for such outstanding eurodollar loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all loans held by the lenders holding eurodollar loans and by such lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and interest periods) in accordance with their respective commitments. 3.11 taxes. (a) any and all payments by any credit party to or for the account of any lender or the administrative agent hereunder or under any other credit document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each lender and the administrative agent, taxes imposed on its income, and branch profits taxes and franchise taxes imposed on it, other than any such taxes imposed on a lender or the administrative agent solely as a result of the activities of the borrower or any of the other credit parties (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "taxes"). if any credit party shall be required by law to deduct any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under this credit agreement or any other credit document to any lender or the administrative agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section 3.11) such lender or the administrative agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such credit party shall make such deductions, (iii) such credit party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such credit party shall furnish to the administrative agent or the affected lender (as the case may be), at its address referred to in section 11.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (b) in addition, the borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this credit agreement or any other credit document or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this credit agreement or any other credit document (hereinafter referred to as "other taxes"). (c) the borrower agrees to indemnify each lender and the administrative agent for the full amount of taxes and other taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes or other taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section 3.11) paid by such lender or the administrative agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. (d) each lender that is not a united states person under section 7701(a)(30) of the code (a "foreign lender"), on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this credit agreement in the case of each lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a lender in the case of each other lender, and from 56 time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the borrower or the administrative agent (but only so long as such lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the borrower and the administrative agent with (i) (a) internal revenue service form w-8 ben, or any successor form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that such lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the united states of america is a party which reduces to zero the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest, (b) internal revenue service form w-8eci, or any successor form prescribed by the internal revenue service, certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this credit agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states of america, or (c) any other form or certificate required by any taxing authority (including any certificate required by sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the code), certifying that such lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on payments pursuant to this credit agreement or any of the other credit documents, and (ii) internal revenue service form w-8ben, w-8eci or w-9, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the internal revenue service. each foreign lender who does not deliver a form w-8eci represents that all services performed hereunder with respect to any fees received or to be received will have been, and will be, performed outside of the united states of america. (e) for any period with respect to which a lender has failed to comply with the provisions of section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b) with respect to taxes imposed by the united states of america; provided, however, that should a lender, which is otherwise exempt from withholding tax, become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the borrower shall take such steps as such lender shall reasonably request to assist such lender to recover such taxes. (f) if any credit party is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any lender pursuant to this section 3.11, then such lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such lender. (g) without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the credit parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the credit parties contained in this section 3.11 shall survive the repayment of the loans, loc obligations and other obligations under the credit documents and the termination of the commitments hereunder. 3.12 compensation. upon demand of any lender (with a copy to the administrative agent) from time to time, the borrower shall promptly compensate such lender for and hold such lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any loan other than a base rate loan on a day other than the last day of the interest period for such loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 57 (b) any failure by the borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such lender to make a loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any loan other than a base rate loan on the date or in the amount notified by the borrower; or (c) any assignment of a eurodollar loan on a day other than the last day of the interest period therefor as a result of a request by the borrower pursuant to section 3.17; including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. the borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such lender in connection with the foregoing. for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the borrower to the lenders under this section 3.12, each lender shall be deemed to have funded each eurodollar loan made by it at the interbank offered rate for such loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore dollar interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such eurodollar loan was in fact so funded. the covenants of the borrower set forth in this section 3.12 shall survive the repayment of the loans, loc obligations and other obligations under the credit documents and the termination of the commitments hereunder. 3.13 pro rata treatment. except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) loans. each payment or (subject to the terms of section 3.3) prepayment of principal of any loan or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under letters of credit, each payment of interest on the loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under letters of credit, each payment of revolving commitment unused fees, each payment of delayed-draw term loan commitment unused fees, each payment of the standby letter of credit fee, each payment of the trade letter of credit fee, each reduction of the revolving committed amount and each conversion or extension of any loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding loans of the applicable type and participation interests in loans of the applicable type and letters of credit. (b) advances. no lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, a purchase of assignments from the fronting bank) hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other lender of its obligations hereunder. unless the administrative agent shall have been notified by any lender prior to the date of any requested borrowing that such lender does not intend to make available to the administrative agent its ratable share of such borrowing (and/or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, a purchase of assignments from the fronting bank) to be made on such date, the administrative agent (and/or, in the case of a delayed-draw 58 term loan borrowing, the fronting bank) may assume that such lender has made such amount available to the administrative agent on the date of such borrowing, and the administrative agent (and, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank) in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its (or their, as applicable) sole discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available to the borrower a corresponding amount. if such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the administrative agent (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank), the administrative agent (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank) shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such lender. if such lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon demand therefor by the administrative agent (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank), the administrative agent will promptly notify the borrower, and the borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the administrative agent (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank). the administrative agent (or, in the case of a delayed-draw term loan borrowing, the fronting bank) shall also be entitled to recover from the lender or the borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the administrative agent (or the fronting bank, as applicable) to the borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the administrative agent (or the fronting bank, as applicable) at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the notice of borrowing or the delayed-draw term loan funding notice and (ii) from a lender at the federal funds rate. 3.14 sharing of payments. the lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any lender shall obtain payment in respect of any loan, loc obligations or any other obligation owing to such lender under this credit agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under section 506 of title 11 of the united states code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this credit agreement, such lender shall promptly purchase from the other lenders a participation interest in such loans, loc obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this credit agreement. the lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a lender obtained by such lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. the borrower agrees that any lender so purchasing such a participation interest may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation interest as fully as if such lender were a holder of such loan, loc obligations or other obligation in the amount of such participation interest. except as otherwise expressly provided in this credit agreement, if any lender shall fail to remit to the administrative agent or any other lender an 59 amount payable by such lender to the administrative agent or such other lender pursuant to this credit agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the administrative agent or such other lender at a rate per annum equal to the federal funds rate. if under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this section 3.14 applies, such lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the lenders under this section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. 3.15 payments, computations, etc. (a) generally. except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments hereunder shall be made to the administrative agent in dollars in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff of any kind, at the administrative agent's office specified in schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00 p.m. (charlotte, north carolina time) on the date when due. payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding business day. the administrative agent may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the borrower or any other credit party maintained with the administrative agent (with notice to the borrower or such other credit party). the borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this credit agreement, specify to the administrative agent the loans, loc obligations, fees, interest or other amounts payable by the borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the administrative agent shall distribute such payment to the lenders in such manner as the administrative agent may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of section 3.13(a) and section 3.15(b)). the administrative agent will distribute such payments to such lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (charlotte, north carolina time) on a business day in like funds as received prior to the end of such business day and otherwise the administrative agent will distribute such payment to such lenders on the next succeeding business day. whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a business day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding business day (subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of eurodollar loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding business day. except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to computation of interest on base rate loans which shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment. (b) allocation of payments after acceleration. notwithstanding any other provisions of this credit agreement to the contrary, after acceleration of the credit party obligations pursuant to section 9.2, all amounts collected or received by the administrative agent or any lender on account of the credit party obligations or any other amounts 60 outstanding under any of the credit documents or in respect of the collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows: first, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the administrative agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the lenders under the credit documents and any protective advances made by the administrative agent with respect to the collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the collateral documents; second, to payment of any fees owed to the administrative agent; third, to the payment of all of the credit party obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest (including, without limitation, accrued fees and interest arising under any hedging agreement between the borrower and any lender, or any affiliate of a lender); fourth, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the credit party obligations (including, without limitation, the outstanding principal amount arising under any hedging agreement between the borrower and any lender, or any affiliate of a lender and the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding loc obligations); fifth, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of each of the lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the credit documents or otherwise with respect to the credit party obligations owing to such lender; sixth, to all other credit party obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the credit documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "first" through "fifth" above; and seventh, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. in carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding loans and loc obligations held by such lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding loans and loc obligations) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "third", "fourth", "fifth" and "sixth" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "fifth" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, such amounts shall be held by the administrative agent in a cash collateral account and applied (a) first, to reimburse the issuing lender from time to time for any drawings under such letters of credit and (b) then, following the expiration of all letters of credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "fifth" and "sixth" above in the manner provided in this section 3.15(b). 61 3.16 evidence of debt. (a) each lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each loan made by such lender to the borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time to time under this credit agreement. each lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary. (b) the administrative agent shall maintain the register pursuant to section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each lender, in which register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and interest period of each such loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the administrative agent hereunder from or for the account of any credit party and each lender's share thereof. the administrative agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary. (c) the entries made in the accounts, register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this section 3.16 (and, if consistent with the entries of the administrative agent, clause (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the credit parties therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any lender or the administrative agent to maintain any such account, such register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the credit parties to repay the credit party obligations owing to such lender. 3.17 replacement of affected lenders. if (i) any lender having a revolving commitment or a delayed-draw term loan commitment becomes a defaulting lender or otherwise defaults in its revolving commitment or delayed-draw term loan commitment, as applicable, (ii) any credit party is required to make any payments to any lender under section 3.6, section 3.9 or section 3.11 in excess of the proportionate amount (based on the respective commitments and/or loans of the lenders) of corresponding payments required to be made to the other lenders or (iii) any lender is unable or unwilling to make, maintain, and fund eurodollar loans as contemplated by section 3.8, the borrower shall have the right, if no event of default then exists, to replace such lender (the "replaced lender") with one or more other eligible assignee or eligible assignees, none of whom shall constitute a defaulting lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the "replacement lender"), provided that (a) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this section 3.17, the replaced lender and replacement lender shall enter into an assignment and acceptance pursuant to which the replacement lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the commitments and outstanding loans of, and participation in letters of credit by, the replaced lender and (b) all obligations of the borrower owing to the replaced lender relating to the loans so replaced (including, without limitation, such increased costs and excluding those specifically described in clause (a) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such replaced lender concurrently with such replacement. upon the execution of the appropriate assignment 62 and acceptance, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above and, if so requested by the replacement lender, delivery to the replacement lender of the appropriate note or notes executed by the borrower, the replacement lender shall become a lender hereunder and the replaced lender shall cease to constitute a lender hereunder with respect to such replaced loans, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this credit agreement, which shall survive as to such replaced lender. notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, (1) the lender that acts as the issuing lender may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has letters of credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the issuing lender (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to such issuing lender or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account maintained with the administrative agent in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such issuing lender) have been made with respect to such outstanding letters of credit and (2) the lender that acts as the administrative agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of section 10.9. the replaced lender shall be required to deliver for cancellation its applicable notes to be canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such note is lost or unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification therefor as the borrower may reasonably request. section 4 guaranty 4.1 the guaranty. each of the guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each lender, each affiliate of a lender that enters into a hedging agreement, and the administrative agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the credit party obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. the guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the credit party obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the credit party obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the credit documents or hedging agreements, the obligations of each guarantor under this credit agreement and the other credit documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under section 548 of the bankruptcy code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. 63 4.2 obligations unconditional. the obligations of the guarantors under section 4.1 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the credit documents or hedging agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, subordination, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the credit party obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this section 4.2 that the obligations of the guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. each guarantor agrees that such guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution (including, without limitation, any right of contribution under section 4.6 hereof) against the borrower or any other guarantor for amounts paid under this section 4 until such time as the credit party obligations have been fully satisfied. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the credit party obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the credit documents, any hedging agreement between any consolidated party and any lender, or any affiliate of a lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the credit documents or such hedging agreements shall be done or omitted; (c) the maturity of any of the credit party obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the credit party obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the credit documents, any hedging agreement between any consolidated party and any lender, or any affiliate of a lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the credit documents or such hedging agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the credit party obligations or any security therefor shall be released, subordinated, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; (d) any lien granted to, or in favor of, the administrative agent or any lender or lenders as security for any of the credit party obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or (e) any of the credit party obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of any guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any guarantor). with respect to its obligations hereunder, each guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the administrative agent or any lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any 64 person under any of the credit documents, any hedging agreement between any consolidated party and any lender, or any affiliate of a lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the credit documents or such hedging agreements, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the credit party obligations. 4.3 reinstatement. the obligations of the guarantors under this section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any person in respect of the credit party obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the credit party obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the administrative agent and each lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the administrative agent or such lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. 4.4 certain additional waivers. without limiting the generality of the provisions of this section 4, each guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of n.c. gen. stat. sections 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive, to the extent applicable. each guarantor further agrees that such guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the credit party obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to section 4.6. 4.5 remedies. the guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as between the guarantors, on the one hand, and the administrative agent and the lenders, on the other hand, the credit party obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said section 9.2) for purposes of section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the credit party obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the credit party obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the credit party obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the guarantors for purposes of section 4.1. the guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of the collateral documents and that the lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof. 4.6 rights of contribution. the guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any guarantor shall make an excess payment (as defined below), such guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other guarantor in an amount equal to such other guarantor's contribution share (as defined below) of such excess payment. the payment obligations of any guarantor under this section 4.6 shall be 65 subordinate and subject in right of payment to the credit party obligations until such time as the credit party obligations have been fully satisfied, and none of the guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this section 4.6 against any other guarantor until such credit party obligations have been fully satisfied. for purposes of this section 4.6, (a) "excess payment" shall mean the amount paid by any guarantor in excess of its pro rata share of any guaranteed obligations; (b) "pro rata share" shall mean, for any guarantor in respect of any payment of credit party obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of guaranteed obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of all of the credit parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the credit parties hereunder) of the credit parties;

(b) for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in section 5.1, each lender that has signed this credit agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the administrative agent to such lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a lender. 10.5 notice of default. the administrative agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any default or event of default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the administrative agent for the account of the lenders, unless the administrative agent shall have received written notice from a lender or the borrower referring to this credit agreement, describing such default or event of default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". the administrative agent will promptly notify the lenders of its receipt of any such notice. the administrative agent shall take such action with respect to such default or event of default as may be directed by the required lenders in accordance with section 9.2; provided, however, that unless and until the administrative agent has received any such direction, the administrative agent may (but shall not be obligated to) 107 take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such default or event of default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the lenders. 10.6 credit decision;

provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the required lenders or all the lenders, if required hereunder, shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for 108 purposes of this section. without limitation of the foregoing, each lender shall reimburse the administrative agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred by the administrative agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this credit agreement, any other credit document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the credit parties are required to reimburse the administrative agent hereunder and the administrative agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the credit parties. the undertaking in this section shall survive termination of the commitments, the payment of all credit party obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the administrative agent. 10.8 administrative agent in its individual capacity. bank of america and its affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the credit parties and their respective affiliates as though bank of america were not the administrative agent or the issuing lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the lenders. the lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, bank of america or its affiliates may receive information regarding any credit party or its affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such credit party or such affiliate) and acknowledge that the administrative agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. with respect to its loans, bank of america shall have the same rights and powers under this credit agreement as any other lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the administrative agent or the issuing lender, and the terms "lender" and "lenders" include bank of america in its individual capacity. 10.9 successor administrative agent. the administrative agent may resign as administrative agent upon 30 days' notice to the lenders. if the administrative agent resigns under this credit agreement, the required lenders shall appoint from among the lenders a successor administrative agent for the lenders which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the borrower at all times other than during the existence of an event of default (which consent of the borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). if no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the administrative agent, the administrative agent may appoint, after consulting with the lenders and the borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the lenders. upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring administrative agent and the term "administrative agent" shall mean such successor administrative agent and the retiring administrative agent's appointment, powers and duties as administrative agent shall be terminated. after any retiring administrative agent's resignation hereunder as administrative agent, the provisions of this section 10 and sections 11.5 and 11.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was administrative agent under this credit agreement. if no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as administrative agent by the date which is 30 days following 109 a retiring administrative agent's notice of resignation, the retiring administrative agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the lenders shall perform all of the duties of the administrative agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the required lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. 10.10 borrower assignment, assumption and release. without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing provisions of this section 9, each lender hereby authorizes the administrative agent on its behalf to execute and deliver the borrower assignment, assumption and release. 10.11 other administrative agents;

(e) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under section 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 or 3.12 than the applicable lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant. a participant that is not a united states person under section 7701(a)(30) of the code shall not be entitled to the benefits of section 3.11 unless the borrower is notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the borrower, to comply with section 3.11(d) as though it were a lender. (f) any lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this credit agreement (including under its notes, if any) to secure obligations of such lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a federal reserve bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release a lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such lender as a party hereto. (g) any lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may create a security interest in all or any portion of the loans owing to it and the note or notes held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided, that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a lender in compliance with the other provisions of this section 11.3, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging lender from any of its obligations hereunder and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a lender under the 114 credit documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise. (h) if the consent of the borrower to an assignment or to an eligible assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment threshold specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of section 11.3(b)), the borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five (5) business days after confirmation (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) by an executive officer of the borrower of receipt of notice of such proposed assignment by the assigning lender (through the administrative agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by the borrower prior to such fifth business day. (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time bank of america assigns all of its commitment and loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, bank of america may, upon 30 days' notice to the borrower and the lenders, resign as issuing lender. in the event of any such resignation as issuing lender, the borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the lenders a successor issuing lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of bank of america as issuing lender. bank of america shall retain all the rights and obligations of the issuing lender hereunder with respect to all letters of credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as issuing lender and all loc obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the lenders to make revolving loans or fund their participation interests pursuant to section 2.2). (j) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any credit document, the master assignment agreement shall be deemed to be an assignment and acceptance executed in compliance with this section 11.3. 11.4 no waiver; remedies cumulative. no failure or delay on the part of the administrative agent or any lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other credit document and no course of dealing between the administrative agent or any lender and any of the credit parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other credit document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. the rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the administrative agent or any lender would otherwise have. no notice to or demand on any credit party in any case shall entitle the credit parties to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the administrative agent or the lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 11.5 expenses; indemnification. (a) the credit parties jointly and severally agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the administrative agent in connection with the syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and amendment of this 115 credit agreement, the other credit documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the administrative agent (including the cost of internal counsel) with respect thereto and with respect to advising the administrative agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the credit documents. the credit parties further jointly and severally agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the administrative agent and the lenders, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and the cost of internal counsel), in connection with any work-out or restructuring relating to the credit facilities or any enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of any of the credit documents.

(b) sale of pledged collateral. upon the occurrence of an event of default and during the continuation thereof, without limiting the generality of this section and without notice, the administrative agent may, in its sole discretion, sell or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the pledged collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels, at public or private sale, at any exchange or broker's board or elsewhere, at such price or prices and on such other terms as are commercially reasonable, for cash, credit or for future delivery or otherwise in accordance with applicable law. to the extent permitted by law, any lender may in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities. each obligor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law and has not been waived by such obligor, any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if notice, specifying the place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made, is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to such obligor, in accordance with the notice provisions of section 11.1 of the credit agreement at least 10 days before the time of such sale. the administrative agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of pledged collateral of such obligor regardless of notice of sale having been given. the administrative agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

(e) deficiency. in the event that the proceeds of any sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the administrative agent or the lenders are legally entitled, the obligors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the default rate specified in section 3.1 of the credit agreement for revolving loans that are base rate loans, together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees of any attorneys employed by the administrative agent to collect such deficiency. any surplus remaining after the full payment and satisfaction of the obligor obligations shall be returned to the obligors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine to be entitled thereto. 10. rights of the administrative agent. (a) power of attorney. in addition to other powers of attorney contained herein, each obligor hereby designates and appoints the administrative agent, on behalf of the lenders, and each of its designees or agents as attorney-in-fact of such obligor, irrevocably and with power of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following actions upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default: (i) to demand, collect, settle, compromise, adjust and give discharges and releases concerning the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder, all as the administrative agent may reasonably determine; (ii) to commence and prosecute any actions at any court for the purposes of collecting any of the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder and enforcing any other right in respect thereof; (iii) to defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharge or release as the administrative agent may deem reasonably appropriate; (iv) to pay or discharge taxes, liens, security interests, or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder; (v) to direct any parties liable for any payment under any of the pledged collateral to make payment of any and all monies due 8 and to become due thereunder directly to the administrative agent or as the administrative agent shall direct; (vi) to receive payment of and receipt for any and all monies, claims, and other amounts due and to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder; (vii) to sign and endorse any drafts, assignments, proxies, stock powers, verifications, notices and other documents relating to the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder; (viii) to settle, compromise or adjust any suit, action or proceeding described above and, in connection therewith, to give such discharges or releases as the administrative agent may deem reasonably appropriate; (ix) execute and deliver all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, renewal financing statements, pledge agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents that the administrative agent may reasonably determine necessary in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and liens granted in this pledge agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated therein; (x) to exchange any of the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder or other property upon any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the issuer thereof and, in connection therewith, deposit any of the pledged collateral of such obligor with any committee, depository, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms as the administrative agent may reasonably determine; (xi) to sign an instrument in writing, sanctioning the transfer of any or all of the pledged shares of such obligor into the name of the administrative agent or one or more of the lenders or into the name of any transferee to whom the pledged shares of such obligor or any part thereof may be sold pursuant to section 10 hereof; and (xii) to do and perform all such other acts and things as the administrative agent may reasonably deem to be necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the pledged collateral pledged by such obligor hereunder to the extent permitted by applicable law and to effect the purposes of this pledge agreement. this power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable for so long as any of the credit party obligations are not fully satisfied. the administrative agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the administrative agent in this pledge agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any 9 delay in doing so. this power of attorney is conferred on the administrative agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in pledged collateral. (b) performance by the administrative agent of obligor's obligations. if any obligor fails to perform any agreement or obligation contained herein, the administrative agent itself may perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the administrative agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the obligors on a joint and several basis pursuant to section 13 hereof. (c) assignment by the administrative agent. the administrative agent may from time to time assign the obligor obligations and the pledged collateral to any successor administrative agent appointed in accordance with section 10.9 of the credit agreement, and the assignee shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the administrative agent under this pledge agreement in relation thereto.

(e) voting rights in respect of the pledged collateral.

(g) release of pledged collateral. the administrative agent may release any of the pledged collateral from this pledge agreement or may substitute any of the pledged collateral for other pledged collateral without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this pledge agreement as to any pledged collateral not expressly released or substituted, and this pledge agreement shall continue as a first priority lien on all pledged collateral not expressly released or substituted. 11. application of proceeds. after acceleration of the credit party obligations pursuant to section 9.2 of the credit agreement, any payments in respect of the obligor obligations and any proceeds of any pledged collateral, when received by the administrative agent or any of the lenders in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the obligor obligations in the order set forth in section 3.15(b) of the credit agreement, and each obligor irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of such payments and proceeds. 12. costs of counsel. at all times hereafter, the obligors agree to promptly pay upon demand any and all reasonable costs and expenses of the administrative agent or the lenders, 11 (a) as required under section 11.5 of the credit agreement and (b) as necessary to protect the pledged collateral or to exercise any rights or remedies under this pledge agreement or with respect to any pledged collateral. all of the foregoing costs and expenses shall constitute obligor obligations hereunder secured by the pledged collateral. 13. continuing agreement. (a) this pledge agreement shall be a continuing agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the credit party obligations are fully satisfied. at such time as the credit party obligations are fully satisfied, this pledge agreement shall be automatically terminated and the administrative agent and the lenders shall, upon the request and at the expense of the obligors, forthwith release all of its liens and security interests hereunder and shall execute and deliver all ucc termination statements and/or other documents reasonably requested by the obligors evidencing such termination. notwithstanding the foregoing all releases and indemnities provided hereunder shall survive termination of this pledge agreement.

provided that in the event payment of all or any part of the secured obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned, all reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation any reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the administrative agent or any lender in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to be included as a part of the secured obligations secured by the collateral. 13. amendments;

(vi) if an investment resulted in the making of a restricted payment, the aggregate amount of all restricted payments calculated under the foregoing provision will be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise, other than the redesignation 39 of an unrestricted subsidiary or other person as a restricted subsidiary), to the extent such net reduction is not included in the company's consolidated net income; provided that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all restricted payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (x) the cash proceeds received by the company and its restricted subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (y) the initial amount of such investment. (vii) in computing the consolidated net income of the company for purposes of the foregoing clause (i)(4)(c)(i) of this section 4(g), (i) the company may use audited financial statements for the portions of the relevant period for which audited financial statements are available on the date of determination and unaudited financial statements and other current financial data based on the books and records of the company for the remaining portion of such period and (ii) the company will be permitted to rely in good faith on the financial statements and other financial data derived from its books and records that are available on the date of determination. if the company makes a restricted payment that, at the time of the making of such restricted payment, would in the good faith determination of the company be permitted under the requirements of this agreement, such restricted payment will be deemed to have been made in compliance with this agreement notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the company's financial statements affecting consolidated net income of the company for any period. (h) dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries. (i) the company shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any restricted subsidiary to (1) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its capital stock, (2) pay any indebtedness owed to the company or any other restricted subsidiary, (3) make loans or advances to the company or any other restricted subsidiary or (4) transfer any of its properties or assets to the company or any other restricted subsidiary. (ii) however, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (1) any agreement (including the credit agreement) in effect on the closing date; (2) customary non-assignment provisions of any lease, license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of business by the company or any restricted subsidiary; (3) the refinancing or successive refinancing of indebtedness incurred under the agreements (including the credit agreement) in effect on the closing date, so long as such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in such original agreement; (4) any agreement or other instrument of a person acquired by the company or any restricted subsidiary in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is 40 not applicable to any person, or the properties or assets of any person, other than the person, or the property or assets of the person, so acquired; (5) purchase money obligations for acquired property permitted under section 5(i) that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (4) of section 5(h)(i) on the property so acquired; (6) any agreement for the sale of a restricted subsidiary or an asset that restricts distributions by that restricted subsidiary or transfers of such asset pending its sale; (7) secured indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to section 5(l) hereof that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such indebtedness; (8) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by leases entered into in the ordinary course of business; (9) non-recourse indebtedness of any permitted joint venture permitted to be incurred under this agreement; (10) applicable law or regulation; (11) a receivables program with respect to a receivables subsidiary; and (12) customary provisions in joint venture, limited liability company operating, partnership, shareholder and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business reasonably consistent with past practice by the company or any restricted subsidiary. (i) incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock. (i) the company shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, create, issue, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable for the payment of, or otherwise incur (collectively, "incur"), any indebtedness (including acquired indebtedness and the issuance of disqualified stock), except that the company and any subsidiary guarantors may incur indebtedness if, at the time of such event, the fixed charge coverage ratio for the immediately preceding four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available, taken as one accounting period, would have been equal to at least 2.0 to 1.0. (ii) in making the foregoing calculation for any four-quarter period that includes the closing date, pro forma effect will be given to the transaction, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. in addition (but without duplication), in making the foregoing calculation, pro forma effect will be given to: (1) the incurrence of such indebtedness and (if applicable) the application of the net proceeds therefrom, including to refinance other 41 indebtedness, as if such indebtedness was incurred and the application of such proceeds occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; (2) the incurrence, repayment or retirement of any other indebtedness by the company or its restricted subsidiaries since the first day of such four-quarter period as if such indebtedness was incurred, repaid or retired at the beginning of such four-quarter period; and (3) the acquisition (whether by purchase, merger or otherwise) or disposition (whether by sale, merger or otherwise) of any company, entity or business acquired or disposed of by the company or its restricted subsidiaries, as the case may be, since the first day of such four-quarter period, as if such acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. in making a computation under the foregoing clause (1) or (2), (a) the amount of indebtedness under a revolving credit facility will be computed based on the average daily balance of such indebtedness during such four-quarter period, (b) if such indebtedness bears, at the option of the company, a fixed or floating rate of interest, interest thereon will be computed by applying, at the option of the company, either the fixed or floating rate, and (c) the amount of any indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any hedging obligations applicable to such indebtedness if such hedging obligations have a remaining term at the date of determination in excess of 12 months). (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company may, and may permit its restricted subsidiaries to, incur the following indebtedness ("permitted indebtedness"): (1) indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary guarantor under the credit agreement (and the incurrence by any guarantor of guarantees thereof) in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $375,000,000, less any amounts applied to the permanent reduction of such credit facilities pursuant to the provisions of section 5(j); (2) indebtedness represented by the notes (other than the additional notes) and the guarantees; (3) existing indebtedness; (4) the incurrence by the company of permitted refinancing indebtedness in exchange for, or the net cash proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace, any indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred under clause (2) or (3) above; (5) indebtedness owed by the company to any restricted subsidiary or owed by any restricted subsidiary to the company or a restricted subsidiary (provided that such indebtedness is held by the company or such restricted subsidiary); provided that: 42 (a) any indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary guarantor owing to any such restricted subsidiary is unsecured and subordinated in right of payment from and after such time as the notes shall become due and payable (whether at stated maturity, acceleration, or otherwise) to the payment and performance of the company's obligations under the notes or the subsidiary guarantor's obligations under its guarantee, as the case may be; and (b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of equity interests that results in any such indebtedness being held by a person other than the company or a restricted subsidiary thereof and (y) any sale or other transfer of any such indebtedness to a person that is not either the company or a restricted subsidiary thereof, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such indebtedness by the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (5); (6) indebtedness of the company or any restricted subsidiary under hedging obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business; (7) indebtedness of the company or any restricted subsidiary consisting of guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of capital stock; (8) either (a) capitalized lease obligations of the company or any restricted subsidiary or (b) indebtedness under purchase money mortgages or secured by purchase money security interests so long as (x) such indebtedness is not secured by any property or assets of the company or any restricted subsidiary other than the property and assets so acquired and (y) such indebtedness is created within 90 days of the acquisition of the related property; provided that the aggregate amount of indebtedness under clauses (a) and (b) does not exceed 15% of consolidated tangible assets at any one time outstanding; (9) guarantees by any restricted subsidiary made in accordance with the provisions of section 5(s); (10) indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided that such indebtedness is extinguished within two business days of incurrence; (11) indebtedness of the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries represented by letters of credit for the account of the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, in order to provide security for workers' 43 compensation claims, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements in the ordinary course of business; (12) the incurrence of non-recourse indebtedness by permitted joint ventures that are restricted subsidiaries; (13) indebtedness incurred by a receivables subsidiary pursuant to a receivables program; provided that, after giving effect to any such incurrence of indebtedness, the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness incurred under this clause (13) and then outstanding does not exceed $30,000,000; and (14) indebtedness of the company, any restricted subsidiary or any permitted joint venture not permitted by any other clause of this definition, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30,000,000 at any one time outstanding. (iv) for purposes of determining compliance with this section 5(i), in the event that any proposed indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted indebtedness described in clauses (1) through (14) of section 5(i)(iii), or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to section 5(i)(i), the company will be permitted to classify such item of indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. indebtedness under the credit agreement immediately following the acquisition shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date of the acquisition in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) of section 5(i)(iii). (j) asset sales. (i) the company shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, engage in any asset sale unless (x) the consideration received by the company or such restricted subsidiary for such asset sale is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold evidenced by a resolution of the board of directors of such entity set forth in an officers' certificate delivered to the holders and (y) the consideration received by the company or the relevant restricted subsidiary in respect of such asset sale consists of at least 75% cash or cash equivalents (for purposes of this clause (y), cash and cash equivalents includes (a) any liabilities (as reflected in the company's consolidated balance sheet) of the company or any restricted subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any guarantee) that are assumed by any transferee of any such assets or other property in such asset sale, and where the company or the relevant restricted subsidiary is released from any further liability in connection therewith with respect to such liabilities, (b) any securities, notes or other similar obligations received by the company or any such restricted subsidiary from such transferee that are converted within 180 days of the consummation of the related asset sale by the company or such restricted subsidiary into cash and cash equivalents (to the extent of the net cash proceeds or the cash equivalents (net of related costs) received upon such conversion) and (c) any designated noncash consideration received by the company or any such restricted subsidiary in the asset sale having an aggregate fair market value, as determined by the board of the company, taken together with all other designated noncash consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of: 44 (1) $10,000,000; and (2) 15% of consolidated tangible assets at the time of the receipt of such designated noncash consideration (with the fair market value of each item of such designated noncash consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (ii) if the company or any restricted subsidiary engages in an asset sale, the company may, at its option, within 12 months after such asset sale, (1) apply all or a portion of the net cash proceeds to the permanent reduction of amounts outstanding under the credit agreement (and to correspondingly reduce the commitments, if any, with respect thereto) or to the permanent repayment of other senior indebtedness of the company or a restricted subsidiary, provided that the repayment of any indebtedness incurred under the credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of any facility with the proceeds of any subsequent sale and leaseback transaction relating to such facility shall not be required to result in the permanent reduction of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement or correspondingly permanently reduce the commitments thereunder, or (2) invest (or enter into a legally binding agreement to invest) all or a portion of such net cash proceeds in properties and assets to replace the properties and assets that were the subject of the asset sale or in properties and assets that will be used in the businesses of the company or its restricted subsidiaries, as the case may be, existing on the closing date or in businesses the same, similar or reasonably related thereto. if any such legally binding agreement to invest such net cash proceeds is terminated, the company may, within 90 days of such termination or within 12 months of such asset sale, whichever is later, invest such net cash proceeds as provided in clause (1) or (2) (without regard to the parenthetical contained in such clause (2)) above. pending the final application of any such net cash proceeds, the company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such net cash proceeds in a manner that is not prohibited by this agreement. the amount of such net cash proceeds not so used as set forth above in this paragraph shall constitute "excess proceeds." (c) when the aggregate amount of excess proceeds exceeds $10,000,000, the company will, within 30 days thereafter, make an offer to purchase (an "excess proceeds offer") from all holders of notes on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this agreement, the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of notes that may be purchased with the excess proceeds, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date such offer to purchase is consummated. to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of notes tendered pursuant to such offer to purchase is less than the excess proceeds, the company may use such deficiency for general corporate purposes. if the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the excess proceeds, the notes to be purchased will be selected on a pro rata basis. upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of excess proceeds will be reset to zero. (iii) the company will comply with the requirements of rule 14e-1 under the exchange act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an excess proceeds offer. to the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict 45 with the asset sales provisions of this agreement, the company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under section 5(j) of this agreement by virtue of such conflict. (k) transactions with affiliates. (i) the company shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction with, or for the benefit of, any affiliate of the company ("interested persons"), unless (1) such transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been obtained in an arm's-length transaction with third parties who are not interested persons and (2) the company delivers to the holders (x) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions entered into after the closing date involving aggregate payments in excess of $5,000,000, a resolution of the company's board set forth in an officers' certificate certifying that such transaction or transactions complies with clause (1) above and that such transaction or transactions have been approved by the board (including a majority of the disinterested directors) of the company and (y) with respect to a transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments equal to or greater than $10,000,000, a written opinion as to the fairness to the company or such restricted subsidiary of such transaction or series of transactions from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm, in each case of national standing. (ii) the foregoing section 5(k)(i) will not restrict: (1) transactions among the company and/or its restricted subsidiaries; (2) the company from paying reasonable and customary regular compensation, indemnification, reimbursement and fees to officers of the company or any restricted subsidiary and to directors of the company or any restricted subsidiary who are not employees of the company or any restricted subsidiary; (3) transactions permitted by section 5(g); (4) advances to employees for moving, entertainment and travel expenses and similar expenditures in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice; (5) any receivables program of the company or a restricted subsidiary; (6) the agreements listed on schedule e hereto, in each case as in effect as of the closing date or any amendment thereto (so long as the amended agreement is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the notes in any material respect than such agreement immediately prior to such amendment) or any transaction contemplated thereby; and (7) sales of equity interests to affiliates. 46 (l) liens. (i) the company shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien securing pari passu indebtedness or subordinated indebtedness of the company on or with respect to any of its property or assets, including any shares of stock or indebtedness of any restricted subsidiary, whether owned at the closing date or thereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income thereon, unless: (1) in the case of any lien securing subordinated indebtedness, the notes are secured by a lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such lien; and (2) in the case of any lien securing pari passu indebtedness, the notes are secured by a lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to or ranks equally with such lien. (ii) the company shall not permit any subsidiary guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien securing pari passu indebtedness or subordinated indebtedness of such subsidiary guarantor on or with respect to such subsidiary guarantor's properties or assets, including any shares of stock or indebtedness of any other restricted subsidiary, whether owned at the date of this agreement or thereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income thereon, unless: (1) in the case of any lien securing pari passu indebtedness of such subsidiary guarantor, each guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor is secured by a lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to or ranks equally with such lien; and (2) in the case of any lien securing subordinated indebtedness of such subsidiary guarantor, each guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor is secured by a lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such lien. (m) [intentionally omitted.] (n) limitation on senior subordinated debt. neither the company nor any guarantor shall incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any indebtedness or guarantee, as applicable, that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to any senior indebtedness and senior in any respect in right of payment to the notes or such guarantor's guarantee, respectively. (o) offer to repurchase upon a change of control. (i) upon the occurrence of a change of control, each holder shall have the right to require the company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such holder's notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "change of control offer") at an offer price (the "change of control payment") in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the "change of control payment date"). within 30 days following any change of control, the company shall mail a notice, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder, describing the transaction or transactions that 47 constitute the change of control and stating (1) that the change of control offer is being made pursuant to this section 5(o) and that all notes tendered will be accepted for payment; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or such later date as is necessary to comply with the requirements under the exchange act (the "change of control payment date"); (3) that any note not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) that, unless the company defaults in the payment of the change of control payment, all notes accepted for payment pursuant to the change of control offer shall cease to accrue interest after the change of control payment date; (5) that holders electing to have any notes purchased pursuant to a change of control offer will be required to surrender the notes, with the form entitled "option of holder to elect purchase" on the reverse of the notes completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third business day preceding the change of control payment date; (6) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second business day preceding the change of control payment date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder, the principal amount of notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its election to have the notes purchased; and (7) that holders whose notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof. the company shall comply with the requirements of rule 14e-1 under the exchange act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a change of control. to the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this agreement relating to such change of control offer, the company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this agreement by virtue thereof. (ii) by 2:00 p.m. (noon) eastern time on the change of control payment date, the company shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment all notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the change of control offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the change of control payment in respect of all notes or portions thereof so tendered and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders the notes so accepted together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions thereof being purchased by the company. the paying agent shall promptly mail to each holder so tendered the change of control payment for such notes, and the company shall promptly execute and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new note shall be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 5(o), the company shall not be required to make a change of control offer upon a change of control if a third party makes the change of control offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this section 5(o) and section 4(i) hereof and all other provisions of this agreement applicable to a change of control offer made by the company and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such change of control offer. 48 (p) limitation on issuances and sales of capital stock of restricted subsidiaries. the company (i) shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to issue any capital stock unless after giving effect thereto the company's percentage interest (direct and indirect) in the capital stock of such restricted subsidiary is at least equal to its percentage interest prior thereto, and (ii) shall not, and shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to, transfer, convey, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any capital stock of any restricted subsidiary to any person (other than the company or a wholly owned restricted subsidiary); provided that this covenant will not prohibit (x) the sale or other disposition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a restricted subsidiary owned by the company and its restricted subsidiaries in compliance with the other provisions of this agreement, (y) the sale or other disposition of a portion of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a restricted subsidiary (other than a subsidiary guarantor) whether or not as a result of such sale or disposition such restricted subsidiary continues or ceases to be a restricted subsidiary if (a) at the time of such sale or disposition, the company could make an investment in the remaining capital stock held by it or one of its restricted subsidiaries in an amount equal to the amount of its remaining investment in such person pursuant to section 5(g) of this agreement and (b) such sale or disposition is permitted under, and the company or such restricted subsidiary applies the net cash proceeds of any such sale in accordance with, the provisions of section 5(j) of this agreement, or (z) the ownership by directors of director's qualifying shares or the ownership by foreign nationals of capital stock of any restricted subsidiary, to the extent mandated by applicable law. the company shall not permit any restricted subsidiary to issue any preferred stock other than to the company or any subsidiary guarantor. (q) unrestricted subsidiaries. (i) the board of the company may designate any subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed subsidiary) to be an unrestricted subsidiary so long as (1) such subsidiary has no indebtedness other than non-recourse indebtedness, (2) no default with respect to any indebtedness of such subsidiary would permit (upon notice, lapse of time or otherwise) any holder of any other indebtedness of the company or any restricted subsidiary to declare a default on such other indebtedness or cause the payment thereof to be accelerated or payable prior to its stated maturity, (3) any investment in such subsidiary made as a result of designating such subsidiary an unrestricted subsidiary will not violate the provisions of section 5(g), (4) neither the company nor any restricted subsidiary has a contract, agreement, arrangement, understanding or obligation of any kind, whether written or oral, with such subsidiary other than those that might be obtained at the time from persons who are not affiliates of the company, (5) neither the company nor any restricted subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests in such subsidiary, or to maintain or preserve such subsidiary's financial condition or to cause such subsidiary to achieve certain levels of operating results, and (6) such unrestricted subsidiary has at least one director on its board of directors that is not a director or executive officer of the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries and has at least one executive officer that is not a director or executive officer of the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company may not designate any subsidiary guarantor (whether or not existing as of the closing date) as an unrestricted subsidary. (ii) the board of the company may designate any unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary; provided that (1) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing following such designation and (2) the company could, at the time of making such 49 designation and giving such pro forma effect as if such designation had been made at the beginning of the applicable four quarter period, incur at least $1.00 of additional indebtedness pursuant to the fixed charge coverage ratio test set forth in clause (i) of section 5(i) (treating any indebtedness of such unrestricted subsidiary as the incurrence of indebtedness by a restricted subsidiary). (r) payments for consent. neither the company nor any of its restricted subsidiaries will, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this agreement or the notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid or is paid to all holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. (s) limitations on guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries. the company shall not permit any restricted subsidiary that is not a subsidiary guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any indebtedness of the company or any indebtedness of any other restricted subsidiary, unless (i) such restricted subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental agreement providing for a guarantee of payment of the notes by such restricted subsidiary on a senior subordinated basis on the same terms as set forth in this agreement and (ii) with respect to any guarantee of subordinated indebtedness by a restricted subsidiary, any such guarantee is subordinated to such restricted subsidiary's guarantee with respect to the notes at least to the same extent as such subordinated indebtedness is subordinated to the notes; provided that the foregoing provision will not be applicable to any guarantee by any restricted subsidiary that existed at the time such person became a restricted subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such person becoming a restricted subsidiary. any guarantee by a restricted subsidiary of the notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer to any person not an affiliate of the company of all of the company's and the restricted subsidiaries' capital stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such restricted subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by this agreement) or (ii) the release or discharge of the guarantee that resulted in the creation of such guarantee of the notes, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee. (t) additional guarantees. the company shall provide to the holders, on the date that any person (other than a foreign subsidiary) becomes a wholly owned restricted subsidiary, a supplement to this agreement, executed by such new wholly owned restricted subsidiary, providing for a full and unconditional guarantee on a senior subordinated basis by such new wholly owned restricted subsidiary of the company's obligations under the notes and this agreement to the same extent as that set forth in this agreement.

(b) liquidation; dissolution; bankruptcy. the holders of senior indebtedness of the company will be entitled to receive payment in full of all obligations due in respect of senior indebtedness of the company (including interest after the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable senior indebtedness of the company) before the holders will be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the notes (except that holders may receive and retain securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the notes to the senior indebtedness and securities issued in exchange for senior indebtedness ("permitted junior securities"), in the event of any distribution to creditors of the company: (i) in a liquidation or dissolution of the company; (ii) in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the company or its property; (iii) 70 in an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) in any marshaling of the company's assets and liabilities. (c) default on designated senior indebtedness. (i) the company may not make any payment in respect of the notes (except in permitted junior securities): (1) in the event any default in the payment of principal of, interest or premium, if any, on any designated senior indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing beyond any applicable period of grace (a "payment event of default"); or (2) if any event of default other than as described in clause (1) above with respect to any designated senior indebtedness (a "non-payment event of default") shall have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such designated senior indebtedness to declare such designated senior debt due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable and the holders receive a notice of such default (a "payment blockage notice") from (a) with respect to the designated senior indebtedness arising under the credit agreement, the agent bank or (b) with respect to any other designated senior indebtedness, the holders or representatives of any such designated senior indebtedness; (ii) payments on the notes may and shall be resumed (1) in the case of a payment event of default, upon the date on which such default is cured or waived and (2) in case of a non-payment event of default, the earlier of the date on which such non-payment event of default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received unless the maturity of any designated senior indebtedness has been accelerated. (iii) no new period of payment blockage may be commenced by a payment blockage notice unless and until (i) 360 days have elapsed since the first day of the effectiveness of the immediately prior payment blockage notice and (ii) all scheduled payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes that have come due have been paid in full in cash. no non-payment event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any payment blockage notice to the trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent payment blockage notice, unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 days. (d) acceleration of securities. if payment of the securities is accelerated because of an event of default, the company shall promptly notify holders of senior indebtedness of the acceleration. (e) when distribution must be paid over. in the event that any holder receives any payment of any obligations with respect to the notes (except in permitted junior securities) at a time when such payment is prohibited by section 15 hereof and such holder has actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by section 15 hereof, such payment shall be held by such holder in trust for the benefit of the holders of senior indebtedness of the 71 company. upon proper written request of the holder of senior indebtedness of the company, such holder shall deliver the amounts in trust to the holders of senior indebtedness or their proper representative. (f) notice by the company. the company shall promptly notify the paying agent and the holders in writing of any facts known to the company that would cause a payment of any obligations with respect to the notes to violate this section 15, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the notes to the senior indebtedness as provided in this section 15. (g) subrogation. after all senior indebtedness is paid in full and until the notes are paid in full, holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the company which by its express terms is subordinated to senior indebtedness of the company to the same extent as the notes are subordinated and which is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of holders of senior indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to senior indebtedness to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the holders have been applied to the payment of senior indebtedness. a distribution made under this section 15 to holders of senior indebtedness that otherwise would have been made to holders is not, as between the company and holders, a payment by the company on the notes. (h) relative rights. this section 15 defines the relative rights of holders and holders of senior indebtedness. nothing in this agreement shall: (a) impair, as between the company and holders, the obligation of the company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the notes in accordance with their terms; (b) affect the relative rights of holders and creditors of the company other than their rights in relation to holders of senior indebtedness; or (c) prevent any holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default or event of default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of senior indebtedness to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to holders. if the company fails because of this section 15 to pay principal of or interest on a note on the due date, the failure is still a default or event of default. (i) subordination may not be impaired by the company. no right of any holder of senior indebtedness to enforce the subordination of the indebtedness evidenced by the notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the company or any holder or by the failure of the company or any holder to comply with this agreement. (j) distribution or notice to representative. whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of senior indebtedness, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their representative. upon any payment or distribution of assets of the company referred to in this section 15, the holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of 72 competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making any distribution to the holders for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the senior indebtedness and other indebtedness of the company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this section 15. (k) authorization to effect subordination. each holder of notes, by the holder's acceptance thereof, agrees to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this section 15. if the holders do not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in order to have these claims allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the company or any guarantor (or any other obligor upon the securities), their creditors and their property at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the lenders under the credit agreement are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the holders of the notes. section 16. guarantees. (a) guarantee. subject to this section 16 each of the guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each holder of a note and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this agreement, the notes or the obligations of the company hereunder or thereunder, that: (i) the principal of and interest on the notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the notes, if any, if lawful (subject in all cases to any applicable grace period provided herein), and all other obligations of the company to the holders hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. each guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection. the guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the notes or this agreement, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any holder of the notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. each guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the company, any right to require a proceeding first against the company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the notes and this agreement. if any holder is required by any court or otherwise to return to the company, the guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either 73 the company or the guarantors, any amount paid by either of the above to such holder, the guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. each guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. each guarantor further agrees that, as between the guarantors, on the one hand, and the holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in section 11 hereof for the purposes of this guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in section 11 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the guarantors for the purpose of this guarantee. the guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the holders under the guarantee. (b) subordination of guarantee. the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee pursuant to this section 16 shall be junior and subordinated to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of such guarantor (including senior indebtedness of the guarantor incurred after the date hereof) on the same basis as the notes are junior and subordinated to the prior payment in full all senior indebtedness of the company, as described in section 15 hereof. for the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain payments by any of the guarantors only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the notes pursuant to this agreement, including section 15 hereof. (c) limitation on guarantor liability. each guarantor, and by its acceptance of securities, each holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the guarantee of such guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of bankruptcy law, the uniform fraudulent conveyance act, the uniform fraudulent transfer act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any guarantee. to effectuate the foregoing intention, the holders and the guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such guarantor will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other guarantor under this section 16, result in the obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. (d) execution and delivery of guarantee. to evidence its guarantee set forth in section 16(a), each guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such guarantee substantially in the form included in exhibit g shall be endorsed by an officer of such guarantor on each note issued by the company and that this agreement shall be executed on behalf of such guarantor by its president or one of its vice presidents. 74 each guarantor hereby agrees that its guarantee set forth in section 16(a) shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each note a notation of such guarantee. if an officer whose signature is on this agreement or on the guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the company issues the note on which a guarantee is endorsed, the guarantee shall be valid nevertheless. the delivery of any note by the company shall constitute due delivery of the guarantee set forth in this agreement on behalf of the guarantors. in the event that the company creates or acquires any new subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this agreement, if required by section 5(t) hereof, the company shall cause such subsidiaries to execute guarantees in accordance with section 5(t) hereof and this section 16, to the extent applicable. (e) releases of guarantors. a guarantor (other than the parent) will be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all of its obligations under its guarantee without any further action on the part of any holder upon a sale or other disposition to a person not an affiliate of the company of all of the capital stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, such subsidiary guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, which transaction is carried out in accordance with section 5(j) of this agreement; provided that any such termination shall occur (x) only to the extent that all obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under all of its guarantees of, and under all of its pledges of assets or other security interests which secure any indebtedness of the company shall also terminate upon such sale, disposition or release and (y) only if the holders are furnished with written notice of such release together with an officers' certificate from such subsidiary guarantor to the effect that all of the conditions to release in this section 16(e) have been satisfied. any guarantor not released from its obligations under its guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the notes and for the other obligations of any guarantor under this agreement as provided in this section 16. 75 section 17. representations and indemnities to survive delivery. the respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the acquisition corp., insight, the guarantors and of their officers and of the purchaser and bas set forth in or made pursuant to this agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the purchaser, bas or acquisition corp., insight or the guarantors or any of its or their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, as the case may be, and will survive delivery of and payment for the securities sold hereunder and any termination of this agreement. section 18. notices. all communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, hand delivered or by facsimile and confirmed to the parties hereto as follows: if to the purchaser or bas: banc of america bridge llc 9 west 57th street new york, ny 10019 facsimile: attention: and to: banc of america securities llc 9 west 57th street new york, ny 10019 facsimile: 212-847-8324 attention: raymond a. cubero, managing director with a copy to: shearman & sterling 599 lexington avenue new york, ny 10022 facsimile: (212) 848-7179 attention: christopher c. paci, esq. if to the company or the guarantors: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd. suite 800 newport beach, ca 92660 facsimile: 949-476-8006 attention: chief financial officer 76 and to: j.w. childs associates, l.p. one federal street 21st floor boston, ma 02110 facsimile: 617-753-1101 attention: edward d. yun with copies to: halifax capital partners, l.p. 1133 connecticut avenue n.w. suite 700 washington, d.c. 20036 facsimile: 202-296-7133 attention: david w. dupree and to: kaye scholer llp 245 park avenue new york, ny 10022 facsimile: 212-836-8689 attention: stephen c. koval, esq. and to: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd. suite 800 newport beach, ca 92660 facsimile: 949-476-0137 attention: general counsel any party hereto may change the address for receipt of communications by giving written notice to the others. 77 section 19. successors. this agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and to the benefit of the employees, officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in section 12 and section 13, and in each case their respective successors, and any holder of the notes, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. section 20. partial unenforceability. the invalidity or unenforceability of any section, paragraph or provision of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section, paragraph or provision hereof. if any section, paragraph or provision of this agreement is for any reason determined to be invalid or unenforceable, there shall be deemed to be made such minor changes (and only such minor changes) as are necessary to make it valid and enforceable. section 21. governing law provisions.

(c) the company shall, so long as any of the notes are outstanding, deliver to the trustee, forthwith upon any officer becoming aware of any default or event of default, an officers certificate specifying such default or event of default and what action the company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. section 4.05 taxes. the company shall pay, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to pay, prior to delinquency, any material taxes, assessments, and governmental levies except such as are contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings or where the failure to effect such payment is not adverse in any material respect to the holders of the notes. section 4.06 stay, extension and usury laws. the company and each of the guarantors covenant (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this indenture; and the company and each of the guarantors (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waive all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenant that they shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. section 4.07 restricted payments.

(iv) the purchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of subordinated indebtedness in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance or sale (other than to a subsidiary) of, subordinated indebtedness, so long as the company or a restricted subsidiary would be permitted to refinance such original subordinated indebtedness with such new subordinated indebtedness pursuant to clause (iv) of the definition of permitted indebtedness; (v) the repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such subordinated indebtedness in the event of a change of control in accordance with provisions similar to section 4.15 hereof; provided that prior to or simultaneously with such repurchase, the company has made the change of control offer as provided in section 4.15 hereof with respect to the notes and has repurchased all notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such change of control offer; and (vi) the purchase, redemption, acquisition, cancellation or other retirement for value of shares of capital stock of the company, options on any such shares or related stock appreciation rights or similar securities, or any dividend, distribution or advance to the parent for the purchase, redemption, acquisition, cancellation or other retirement for value of shares of capital stock of the parent, options on any such shares or related stock appreciation rights or similar securities, in each case held by officers, directors or employees or former officers, directors or employees (or their estates or beneficiaries under their estates) of the company, the parent or any subsidiary of the company, as applicable, or by any employee benefit plan of the company, the parent or any subsidiary of the company, as applicable, upon death, disability, retirement or termination of employment or pursuant to the terms of any employee benefit plan or any other agreement under which such shares of stock or related rights were issued; provided that the aggregate amount of cash applied by the company for such purchase, redemption, acquisition, cancellation or other retirement of such shares of capital stock of the company or the parent after the reference date does not exceed $7.5 million in the aggregate (excluding for purposes of calculating such amount the aggregate amount 49 received by any person in connection with such purchase, redemption, acquisition, cancellation or other retirement of such shares that is concurrently used to repay loans made to such person by the company pursuant to clause (f) of the definition of "permitted investment"); (vii) the payment of dividends or other distributions or the making of loans or advances to the parent in amounts required for the parent to pay franchise taxes and other fees required to maintain its existence and provide for all other customary operating costs of the parent to the extent attributable to the ownership and operation of the company and its restricted subsidiaries, including, without limitation, in respect of director fees and expenses, administrative, legal and accounting services provided by third parties and other customary costs and expenses including all costs and expenses with respect to filings with the sec;

(ix) the payment of dividends or other distributions or the making of loans or advances to the parent in amounts required for the parent to pay to the equity sponsors an annual amount not to exceed $500,000 for payment of management consulting or financial advisory services provided to the company or any of the subsidiaries; and (x) other restricted payments not to exceed $10 million at any one time outstanding. (b) the actions described in clauses (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x) of section 4.07(b) will be restricted payments that will be permitted to be taken in accordance with this section 4.07 but will reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for restricted payments under clause (iv)(iii) of section 4.07(a) hereof and the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of section 4.07(b) will be restricted payments that will be permitted to be taken in accordance with this section 4.07 and will not reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for restricted payments under clause (iv)(iii) of section 4.07(a) hereof. for the purpose of making any calculations under this indenture (i) if a restricted subsidiary is designated an unrestricted subsidiary, the company will be deemed to have made an investment in an amount equal to the greater of the fair market value or net book value of the net assets of such restricted subsidiary at the time of such designation as determined by the 50 board of the company, and (ii) any property transferred to or from an unrestricted subsidiary will be valued at fair market value at the time of such transfer, as determined by the board of the company. the amount of all restricted payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the restricted payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the restricted payment. the fair market value of any non-cash restricted payment shall be determined by the board of the company whose resolution with respect thereto shall be delivered to the trustee, such determination to be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing if such fair market value exceeds $10 million. not later than the date of making any restricted payment, the company shall deliver to the trustee an officers' certificate stating that such restricted payment is permitted and setting forth the basis upon which the calculations required under this section 4.07 were computed, together with a copy of any fairness opinion or appraisal required by this indenture. if the aggregate amount of all restricted payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an investment in an unrestricted subsidiary or other person that thereafter becomes a restricted subsidiary, the aggregate amount of all restricted payments calculated under the foregoing provision will be reduced by the lesser of (x) the net asset value of such subsidiary at the time it becomes a restricted subsidiary and (y) the initial amount of such investment. if an investment resulted in the making of a restricted payment, the aggregate amount of all restricted payments calculated under the foregoing provision will be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise, other than the redesignation of an unrestricted subsidiary or other person as a restricted subsidiary), to the extent such net reduction is not included in the company's consolidated net income; provided that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all restricted payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (x) the cash proceeds received by the company and its restricted subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (y) the initial amount of such investment. in computing the consolidated net income of the company for purposes of section 4.07(a)(iii)(a) hereof, (i) the company may use audited financial statements for the portions of the relevant period for which audited financial statements are available on the date of determination and unaudited financial statements and other current financial data based on the books and records of the company for the remaining portion of such period and (ii) the company will be permitted to rely in good faith on the financial statements and other financial data derived from its books and records that are available on the date of determination. if the company makes a restricted payment that, at the time of the making of such restricted payment, would in the good faith determination of the company be permitted under the requirements of this indenture, such restricted payment will be deemed to have been made in compliance with this indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the company's financial statements affecting consolidated net income of the company for any period. 51 section 4.08 dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries. (a) the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any restricted subsidiary to (i) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its capital stock, (ii) pay any indebtedness owed to the company or any other restricted subsidiary, (iii) make loans or advances to the company or any other restricted subsidiary or (iv) transfer any of its properties or assets to the company or any other restricted subsidiary. (b) however, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (i) any agreement (including the credit agreement) in effect on the reference date; (ii) customary non-assignment provisions of any lease, license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of business by the company or any restricted subsidiary; (iii) the refinancing or successive refinancing of indebtedness incurred under the agreements (including the credit agreement) in effect on the reference date, so long as such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in such original agreement; (iv) any agreement or other instrument of a person acquired by the company or any restricted subsidiary in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any person, or the properties or assets of any person, other than the person, or the property or assets of the person, so acquired; (v) purchase money obligations for acquired property permitted under section 4.09 hereof that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (iv) of section 4.08(a) hereof on the property so acquired; (vi) any agreement for the sale of a restricted subsidiary or an asset that restricts distributions by that restricted subsidiary or transfers of such asset pending its sale; (vii) secured indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to section 4.12 hereof that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such indebtedness; (viii) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by leases entered into in the ordinary course of business; (ix) non-recourse indebtedness of any permitted joint venture permitted to be incurred under the indenture; 52 (x) applicable law or regulation; (xi) a receivables program with respect to a receivables subsidiary; and (xii) customary provisions in joint venture, limited liability company operating, partnership, shareholder and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business reasonably consistent with past practice by the company or any restricted subsidiary. section 4.09 incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock. (a) the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, create, issue, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable for the payment of, or otherwise incur (collectively, "incur"), any indebtedness (including acquired indebtedness and the issuance of disqualified stock), except that the company and any subsidiary guarantors may incur indebtedness if, at the time of such event, the fixed charge coverage ratio for the immediately preceding four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available, taken as one accounting period, would have been equal to at least 2.0 to 1.0. (b) in making the foregoing calculation for any four-quarter period that includes the reference date, pro forma effect will be given to the transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. in addition (but without duplication), in making the foregoing calculation, pro forma effect will be given to: (i) the incurrence of such indebtedness and (if applicable) the application of the net proceeds therefrom, including to refinance other indebtedness, as if such indebtedness was incurred and the application of such proceeds occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; (ii) the incurrence, repayment or retirement of any other indebtedness by the company or its restricted subsidiaries since the first day of such four-quarter period as if such indebtedness was incurred, repaid or retired at the beginning of such four-quarter period; and (iii) the acquisition (whether by purchase, merger or otherwise) or disposition (whether by sale, merger or otherwise) of any company, entity or business acquired or disposed of by the company or its restricted subsidiaries, as the case may be, since the first day of such four-quarter period, as if such acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. in making a computation under the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), (a) the amount of indebtedness under a revolving credit facility will be computed based on the average daily balance of such indebtedness during such four-quarter period, (b) if such indebtedness bears, at the option of the company, a fixed or floating rate of interest, interest thereon will be computed by applying, at the option of the company, either the fixed or floating rate, and (c) the amount of any indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any 53 hedging obligations applicable to such indebtedness if such hedging obligations have a remaining term at the date of determination in excess of 12 months). (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company may, and may permit its restricted subsidiaries to, incur the following indebtedness ("permitted indebtedness"): (i) indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary guarantor under the credit agreement (and the incurrence by any guarantor of guarantees thereof) in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $375 million, less any amounts applied to the permanent reduction of such credit facilities pursuant to the provisions of section 4.10 hereof; (ii) indebtedness represented by the notes (other than the additional notes) and the guarantees; (iii) existing indebtedness; (iv) the incurrence by the company of permitted refinancing indebtedness in exchange for, or the net cash proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace, any indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred under clause (ii) or (iii) above; (v) indebtedness owed by the company to any restricted subsidiary or owed by any restricted subsidiary to the company or a restricted subsidiary (provided that such indebtedness is held by the company or such restricted subsidiary); provided that: (a) any indebtedness of the company or any subsidiary guarantor owing to any such restricted subsidiary is unsecured and subordinated in right of payment from and after such time as the notes shall become due and payable (whether at stated maturity, acceleration, or otherwise) to the payment and performance of the company's obligations under the notes or the subsidiary guarantor's obligations under its guarantee, as the case may be; and (b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of equity interests that results in any such indebtedness being held by a person other than the company or a restricted subsidiary thereof and (y) any sale or other transfer of any such indebtedness to a person that is not either the company or a restricted subsidiary thereof, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such indebtedness by the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (v); (vi) indebtedness of the company or any restricted subsidiary under hedging obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business; (vii) indebtedness of the company or any restricted subsidiary consisting of guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of capital stock; 54 (viii) either (a) capitalized lease obligations of the company or any restricted subsidiary or (b) indebtedness under purchase money mortgages or secured by purchase money security interests so long as (x) such indebtedness is not secured by any property or assets of the company or any restricted subsidiary other than the property and assets so acquired and (y) such indebtedness is created within 90 days of the acquisition of the related property; provided that the aggregate amount of indebtedness under clauses (a) and (b) does not exceed 15% of consolidated tangible assets at any one time outstanding; (ix) guarantees by any restricted subsidiary made in accordance with the provisions of section 4.19 hereof; (x) indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided that such indebtedness is extinguished within two business days of incurrence; (xi) indebtedness of the company or any of its restricted subsidiaries represented by letters of credit for the account of the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, in order to provide security for workers' compensation claims, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements in the ordinary course of business; (xii) the incurrence of non-recourse indebtedness by permitted joint ventures that are restricted subsidiaries; (xiii) indebtedness incurred by a receivables subsidiary pursuant to a receivables program; provided that, after giving effect to any such incurrence of indebtedness, the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness incurred under this clause (xiii) and then outstanding does not exceed $30 million; and (xiv) indebtedness of the company, any restricted subsidiary or any permitted joint venture not permitted by any other clause of this definition, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30 million at any one time outstanding. (d) for purposes of determining compliance with this section 4.09, in the event that any proposed indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted indebtedness described in clauses (i) through (xiv) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to section 4.09(a) hereof, the company will be permitted to classify such item of indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this section 4.09. indebtedness under the credit agreement immediately following the acquisition shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date of the acquisition in reliance on the exception provided by clause (i) of the definition of permitted indebtedness. 55 section 4.10 asset sales. (a) the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, engage in any asset sale unless (i) the consideration received by the company or such restricted subsidiary for such asset sale is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold evidenced by a resolution of the board of directors of such entity set forth in an officers' certificate delivered to the trustee and (ii) the consideration received by the company or the relevant restricted subsidiary in respect of such asset sale consists of at least 75% cash or cash equivalents (for purposes of this clause (ii), cash and cash equivalents includes (1) any liabilities (as reflected in the company's consolidated balance sheet) of the company or any restricted subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any note guarantee) that are assumed by any transferee of any such assets or other property in such asset sale, and where the company or the relevant restricted subsidiary is released from any further liability in connection therewith with respect to such liabilities, (2) any securities, notes or other similar obligations received by the company or any such restricted subsidiary from such transferee that are converted within 180 days of the consummation of the related asset sale by the company or such restricted subsidiary into cash and cash equivalents (to the extent of the net cash proceeds or the cash equivalents (net of related costs) received upon such conversion) and (3) any designated noncash consideration received by the company or any such restricted subsidiary in the asset sale having an aggregate fair market value, as determined by the board of the company, taken together with all other designated noncash consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of: (a) $10 million; and (b) 15% of consolidated tangible assets at the time of the receipt of such designated noncash consideration (with the fair market value of each item of such designated noncash consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) if the company or any restricted subsidiary engages in an asset sale, the company may, at its option, within 12 months after such asset sale, (i) apply all or a portion of the net cash proceeds to the permanent reduction of amounts outstanding under the credit agreement (and to correspondingly reduce the commitments, if any, with respect thereto) or to the permanent repayment of other senior indebtedness of the company or a restricted subsidiary, provided that the repayment of any indebtedness incurred under the credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of any facility with the proceeds of any subsequent sale and leaseback transaction relating to such facility shall not be required to result in the permanent reduction of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement or correspondingly permanently reduce the commitments thereunder, or (ii) invest (or enter into a legally binding agreement to invest) all or a portion of such net cash proceeds in properties and assets to replace the properties and assets that were the subject of the asset sale or in properties and assets that will be used in the businesses of the company or its restricted subsidiaries, as the case may be, existing on the reference date or in businesses the same, similar or reasonably related thereto. if any such legally binding agreement to invest such net cash proceeds is terminated, the company may, within 90 days of such termination or within 12 months of such 56 asset sale, whichever is later, invest such net cash proceeds as provided in clause (i) or (ii) (without regard to the parenthetical contained in such clause (ii)) above. pending the final application of any such net cash proceeds, the company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such net cash proceeds in a manner that is not prohibited by this indenture. the amount of such net cash proceeds not so used as set forth above in this paragraph shall constitute "excess proceeds". (c) when the aggregate amount of excess proceeds exceeds $10 million, the company will, within 30 days thereafter, make an offer to purchase (an "excess proceeds offer") from all holders of notes on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this indenture, the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of notes that may be purchased with the excess proceeds, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date such offer to purchase is consummated. to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of notes tendered pursuant to such offer to purchase is less than the excess proceeds, the company may use such deficiency for general corporate purposes. if the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the excess proceeds, the notes to be purchased will be selected on a pro rata basis. upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of excess proceeds will be reset to zero. section 4.11 transactions with affiliates. (a) the company will not, and will not permit any restricted subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction with, or for the benefit of, any affiliate of the company ("interested persons"), unless (i) such transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the company or such restricted subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been obtained in an arm's-length transaction with third parties who are not interested persons and (ii) the company delivers to the trustee (x) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions entered into after the reference date involving aggregate payments in excess of $5 million, a resolution of the company's board set forth in an officers' certificate certifying that such transaction or transactions complies with clause (i) above and that such transaction or transactions have been approved by the board (including a majority of the disinterested directors) of the company and (y) with respect to a transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments equal to or greater than $10 million, a written opinion as to the fairness to the company or such restricted subsidiary of such transaction or series of transactions from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm, in each case of national standing.

(b) with respect to the holders of senior indebtedness, the trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the trustee as are specifically set forth in this article ten, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of senior indebtedness shall be read into this indenture against the trustee. the trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of senior indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of holders or the company or any other person money or assets to which any holders of senior indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this article ten, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the trustee. section 10.06 notice by the company. the company shall promptly notify the trustee and the paying agent in writing of any facts known to the company that would cause a payment of any obligations with respect to the notes to violate this article ten, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the notes to the senior indebtedness as provided in this article ten. section 10.07 subrogation. after all senior indebtedness is paid in full and until the notes are paid in full, holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the company which by its express terms is subordinated to senior indebtedness of the company to the same extent as the notes are subordinated and which is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of holders of senior indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to senior indebtedness to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the holders have been applied to the payment of senior indebtedness. a distribution made under this article ten to holders of 83 senior indebtedness that otherwise would have been made to holders is not, as between the company and holders, a payment by the company on the notes. section 10.08 relative rights. (a) this article ten defines the relative rights of holders and holders of senior indebtedness. nothing in this indenture shall: (i) impair, as between the company and holders, the obligation of the company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the notes in accordance with their terms; (ii) affect the relative rights of holders of notes and creditors of the company other than their rights in relation to holders of senior indebtedness; or (iii) prevent the trustee or any holder of notes from exercising its available remedies upon a default or event of default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of senior indebtedness to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to holders. (b) if the company fails because of this article ten to pay principal of or interest on a note on the due date, the failure is still a default or event of default. section 10.09 subordination may not be impaired by the company. no right of any holder of senior indebtedness to enforce the subordination of the indebtedness evidenced by the notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the company or any holder or by the failure of the company or any holder to comply with this indenture. section 10.10 distribution or notice to representative.

(a) notwithstanding the provisions of this article ten or any other provision of this indenture, the trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts 84 that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the trustee, and the trustee and the paying agent may continue to make payments on the notes, unless the trustee shall have received at its corporate trust office at least five business days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any obligations with respect to the notes to violate this article ten. only the company or a representative may give the notice. nothing in this article ten shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the trustee under or pursuant to section 7.07 hereof. (b) the trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold senior indebtedness with the same rights it would have if it were not trustee. any agent may do the same with like rights. section 10.12 authorization to effect subordination. each holder, by the holder's acceptance thereof, agrees and directs the trustee on such holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this article ten, and appoints the trustee to act as such holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. if the trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the lenders under the credit agreement are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the holders of the notes. article eleven guarantees section 11.01 guarantee. (a) subject to this article eleven each of the guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each holder of a note authenticated and delivered by the trustee and to the trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this indenture, the notes or the obligations of the company hereunder or thereunder, that: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, interest and liquidated damages, if any, on the notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the notes, if any, if lawful (subject in all cases to any applicable grace period provided herein), and all other obligations of the company to the holders or the trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. each guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection. 85 (b) the guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the notes or this indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any holder of the notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. subject to section 6.06 hereof, each guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the company, any right to require a proceeding first against the company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the notes and this indenture. (c) if any holder or the trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the company, the guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the company or the guarantors, any amount paid by either to the trustee or such holder, this guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.

(a) to evidence its guarantee set forth in section 11.01, each guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such guarantee substantially in the form included in exhibit e shall be endorsed by an officer of such guarantor on each note authenticated and delivered by the trustee and that this indenture shall be executed on behalf of such guarantor by any of its executive officers.

basis. upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of excess proceeds will be reset to zero. 8. selection and notice of redemption if less than all of the notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an offer to purchase at any time, the trustee shall select the notes to be redeemed or purchased among the holders of the notes in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed or, if the notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the trustee considers fair and appropriate. in the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular notes to be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the trustee from the outstanding notes not previously called for redemption. notices of redemption may not be conditional. if any note is to be a1-7 redeemed in part only, the

single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the indenture or the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal of the then outstanding notes and additional notes, if any, voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes). without the consent of any holder of a note, the indenture or the notes may be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes; to evidence the succession of another person to the company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the company; to add to the covenants of the company for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the company; to add additional events of default; to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the indenture by a successor trustee; to secure the

remedies. in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the parent, the company or any restricted subsidiary that is a significant subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. if any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the company specifying the respective event of default. the trustee may withhold from holders a1-8 of the notes notice of any continuing default or event of default (except a default or event of default relating to the payment of principal or interest or liquidated damages, if any) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing default or event of default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing default or event of default in the payment of interest or liquidated damages, if any, on, or the principal of, the notes. 13. trustee dealings with company. the trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the company or its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the company or its affiliates, as if it were not the trustee. 14. no recourse against others. no director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the parent, the company or any subsidiary guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the parent, the company or the subsidiary guarantors under the notes, the indenture, the guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. the waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. the waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. 15. authentication. this note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the trustee or an authenticating agent. 16. additional rights of holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes. in addition to the rights provided to holders under the indenture, holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes shall have all the rights set forth in the registration rights agreement dated as of [___], 200[_], between the company, the parent, the guarantors and the parties named on the signature pages thereof or, in the case of additional notes, holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes shall have the rights set forth in one or more registration rights agreements, if any, between the company, the parent, the guarantors and the other parties thereto, relating to rights given by the company and the guarantors to the purchasers of additional notes (the "registration rights agreement"). 17. cusip numbers. pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the committee on uniform security identification procedures, the company has caused cusip numbers to be printed on the notes and the trustee may use cusip numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to holders. no representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon. the company shall furnish to any holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the indenture and/or the registration rights agreement. requests may be made to: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd., suite 800 a1-9 newport beach, california 92660 attention:

[ ]% 200[_] and thereafter................................................. 100.0000% (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to [______], 200[_], the company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued under the indenture at a redemption price of [__]% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of the initial public equity offerings of the company or the parent; provided that (a) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption, excluding notes held by the parent, the company and its subsidiaries; and (b) the redemption must occur within 60 days of the date of the closing of such initial public equity offering. 6. mandatory redemption. except as set forth in paragraph 7 below, the company shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes. 7. repurchase at option of holder. (a) upon the occurrence of a change of control, each holder of notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such holder's notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "change of control offer") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the "change of control payment"). within 30 days a2-6 following any change of control, the company will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the change of control and offering to repurchase notes on the date specified in such notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. (b) within 365 days after the receipt of any net cash proceeds from an asset sale, the company may, at its option, within 12 months after such asset sale, (i) apply all or a portion of the net cash proceeds to the permanent reduction of amounts outstanding under the credit agreement (and to correspondingly reduce the commitments, if any, with respect thereto) or to the permanent repayment of other senior indebtedness of the company or a restricted subsidiary, provided that the repayment of any indebtedness incurred under the credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of any facility with the proceeds of any subsequent sale and leaseback transaction relating to such facility shall not be required to result in the permanent reduction of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement or correspondingly permanently reduce the commitments thereunder, or (ii) invest (or enter into a legally binding agreement to invest) all or a portion of such net cash proceeds in properties and assets to replace the properties and assets that were the subject of the asset sale or in properties and assets that will be used in the businesses of the company or its restricted subsidiaries, as the case may be, existing on the reference date or in businesses the same, similar or reasonably related thereto. if any such legally binding agreement to invest such net cash proceeds is terminated, the company may, within 90 days of such termination or within 12 months of such asset sale, whichever is later, invest such net cash proceeds as provided in clause (i) or (ii) (without regard to the parenthetical contained in such clause (ii)) above. pending the final application of any such net cash proceeds, the company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such net cash proceeds in a manner that is not prohibited by this indenture. the amount of such net cash proceeds not so used as set forth above in this paragraph shall constitute "excess proceeds". when the aggregate amount of excess proceeds exceeds $10 million, the company will, within 30 days thereafter, make an offer to purchase (an "excess proceeds offer") from all holders of notes on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this indenture, the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of notes that may be purchased with the excess proceeds, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date such offer to purchase is consummated. if the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the excess proceeds, the notes to be purchased will be selected on a pro rata basis. upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of excess proceeds will be reset to zero. 8. selection and notice of redemption if less than all of the notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an offer to purchase at any time, the trustee shall select the notes to be redeemed or purchased among the holders of the notes in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed or, if the notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the trustee considers fair and appropriate. in the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular notes to be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the trustee from the outstanding notes not previously called for redemption. notices of redemption may not be conditional. if any note is to be a2-7 redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. a new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. on and after the redemption date, interest and liquidated damages, if any, cease to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption. 9. denominations, transfer, exchange. the notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. the transfer of notes may be registered and notes may be exchanged as provided in the indenture. the registrar and the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the company may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the indenture. the company is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. also, the company is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed. 10. persons deemed owners. the registered holder of a note will be treated as its owner for all purposes. 11. amendment, supplement and waiver. subject to certain exceptions, the indenture or the notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes and additional notes, if any, voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the indenture or the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal of the then outstanding notes and additional notes, if any, voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes). without the consent of any holder of a note, the indenture or the notes may be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes; to evidence the succession of another person to the company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the company; to add to the covenants of the company for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the company; to add additional events of default; to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the indenture by a successor trustee; to secure the notes; to comply with requirements of the sec in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the trust indenture act; to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the indenture as of its date; or to allow any guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and a guarantee with respect to the notes. 12. defaults and remedies. in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the parent, the company or any restricted subsidiary that is a significant subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. if any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the company specifying the respective event of default. the trustee may withhold from holders a2-8 of the notes notice of any continuing default or event of default (except a default or event of default relating to the payment of principal or interest or liquidated damages, if any) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing default or event of default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing default or event of default in the payment of interest or liquidated damages, if any, on, or the principal of, the notes. 13. trustee dealings with company. the trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the company or its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the company or its affiliates, as if it were not the trustee. 14. no recourse against others. no director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the parent, the company or any subsidiary guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the parent, the company or the subsidiary guarantors under the notes, the indenture, the guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. the waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. the waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. 15. authentication. this note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the trustee or an authenticating agent. 16. additional rights of holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes. in addition to the rights provided to holders under the indenture, holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes shall have all the rights set forth in the registration rights agreement dated as of [___], 200[_], between the company, the parent, the guarantors and the parties named on the signature pages thereof or, in the case of additional notes, holders of restricted global notes and restricted definitive notes shall have the rights set forth in one or more registration rights agreements, if any, between the company, the parent, the guarantors and the other parties thereto, relating to rights given by the company and the guarantors to the purchasers of additional notes (the "registration rights agreement"). 17. cusip numbers. pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the committee on uniform security identification procedures, the company has caused cusip numbers to be printed on the notes and the trustee may use cusip numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to holders. no representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon. the company shall furnish to any holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the indenture and/or the registration rights agreement. requests may be made to: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd., suite 800 a2-9 newport beach, california 92660 attention:

(a) the company and the guarantors agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each holder, its directors, officers, any underwriter in any underwritten public offering of transfer restricted securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter (within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20 of the exchange act), from and against (i) any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which transfer restricted securities are registered under the act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim 16 whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, provided that (subject to section 8(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the company and the guarantors; and (iii) any and all expenses whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by any indemnified party, subject to the limitations in section 8(c) below), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company and the guarantors by the purchaser, such holder or such underwriter expressly for use in a registration statement (or any amendment thereto) or any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, that the company will not be liable to any purchaser, holder (in its capacity as holder) or underwriter (or any person who controls such party within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20 of the exchange act) with respect to any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus to the extent that the company shall sustain the burden of proving that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such purchaser, holder (in its capacity as holder) or underwriter, as the case may be, sold transfer restricted securities to a person to whom such purchaser, holder (in its capacity as holder) or underwriter, as the case may be, failed to send or give, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities a copy of the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented) if the company has previously furnished copies thereof (sufficiently in advance of the closing of such sale to allow for distribution of the final prospectus in a timely manner) to such purchaser, holder (in its capacity as holder) or underwriter, as the case may be, and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such purchaser, holder (in its capacity as holder) or underwriter, as the case may be, resulted solely from an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from such preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the final prospectus. (b) each holder of transfer restricted securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the company and the guarantors, and their respective directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of section 15 of the act or section 20 of the exchange act) the company, or the guarantors to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company and the guarantors set forth in section (a) above, but only with reference to information relating to such holder furnished in writing to the company by such holder expressly for use in any registration statement. in no event shall any holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such holder with respect to its sale of transfer restricted securities pursuant to a registration statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such holder for such transfer restricted securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. 17 (c) in case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 8(a) or 8(b) (the "indemnified party"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying person") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both sections 8(a) and 8(b), a holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the holder). any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notification by the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). in any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed promptly following receipt of invoice therefor as they are incurred. such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to section 8(a), and by the company and guarantors, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to section 8(b). the indemnifying party under this section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the final terms of such proposed settlement as soon as practicable prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such 18 indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding. (d) to the extent that the indemnification provided for in this section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and the guarantors, on the one hand, and the holders, on the other hand, from their sale of transfer restricted securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the company and the guarantors, on the one hand, and of the holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the company and the guarantors, on the one hand, and of the holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or such guarantor, on the one hand, or by the holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the third sentence of section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. the company, the guarantors and each holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 8, no holder, its directors, its officers or any person, if any, who controls such holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such holder with respect to the sale of transfer restricted securities pursuant to a registration statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such holder for such transfer restricted securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of transfer restricted securities held by each holder hereunder and not joint. 19 section 9. rule 144a and rule 144. the company and each guarantor agree with each holder, for so long as any transfer restricted securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the company (i) is not subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the exchange act, to make available, upon written request of any holder, to such holder or beneficial owner of transfer restricted securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such transfer restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, the information required by rule 144a(d)(4) under the act in order to permit resales of such transfer restricted securities pursuant to rule 144a, and (ii) is subject to section 13 or 15 (d) of the exchange act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such transfer restricted securities pursuant to rule 144. section 10. miscellaneous. (a) remedies. the company and the guarantors acknowledge and agree that any failure by the company and/or the guarantors to comply with their respective obligations under sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the purchaser or the holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the purchaser or any holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the company's and the guarantors' obligations under sections 3 and 4 hereof. the company and the guarantors further agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) no inconsistent agreements. none of the company or the guarantors will, on or after the date of this agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders in this agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. none of the company or the guarantors has previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any person. the rights granted to the holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the company's or the guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof. (c) amendments and waivers. the provisions of this agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of section 5 hereof and this section 10(c)(i), the company has obtained the written consent of holders of all outstanding transfer restricted securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the company has obtained the written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of transfer restricted securities (excluding transfer restricted securities held by the company or its affiliates). notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of holders whose transfer restricted securities are being tendered pursuant to the exchange offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other holders whose transfer restricted securities are not being tendered pursuant to such exchange offer, may be given by the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of transfer restricted securities subject to such exchange offer. (d) third party beneficiary. the holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the company and the guarantors, on the one hand, and the purchaser, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to 20 the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of holders hereunder. (e) notices. all notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telecopier, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (1) if to a holder, at the address set forth on the records of the registrar under the indenture, with a copy to the registrar under the indenture; and (2) (i) if to the company or any guarantor: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd. suite 800 newport beach, ca 92660 facsimile: 949-476-8006 attention: chief financial officer with copies to: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd. suite 800 newport beach, ca 92660 facsimile: 949-476-0137 attention: general counsel and to: j.w. childs associates, l.p. one federal street 21st floor boston, ma 02110 facsimile: 617-753-1101 attention: edward d. yun and to: the halifax group, l.l.c. 1133 connecticut avenue n.w. suite 700 washington, d.c. 20036 facsimile: 202-296-7133 attention: david w. dupree 21 and to: kaye scholer llp 245 park avenue new york, ny 10022 facsimile: 212-836-8689 attention: stephen c. koval, esq. all such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when receipt acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next business day, if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the person giving the same to the trustee at the address specified in the indenture.

purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date such offer to purchase is consummated. if the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the excess proceeds, the notes to be purchased will be selected on a pro rata basis. upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of excess proceeds will be reset to zero. 7. selection and notice of redemption. in case the company is entitled to, and elects to, redeem less than all of the notes, the company shall redeem the

shall relate, in the case of any notes redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such notes which has been or is to be redeemed. notices of redemption may not be conditional. if any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. a new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. on and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption. 8. denominations, transfer, exchange. the notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. the transfer of notes may be registered and notes may be exchanged as provided in the agreement. the company is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. also, the company is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed. 9. persons deemed owners. the registered holder of a note will be treated as its owner for all purposes. g-5 10. amendment, supplement and waiver. subject to certain exceptions, the agreement or the notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes, if any, voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the agreement or the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal of the then outstanding notes voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes). without the consent of any holder of a note, the agreement or the notes may be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; to evidence the succession of another person to the company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the company; to add to the covenants of the company for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the company; to add additional events of default; to secure the notes; or to allow any guarantor to execute a supplemental agreement to the agreement and a guarantee with respect to the notes. 11. defaults and remedies. in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the parent, the company or any restricted subsidiary that is a significant subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. if any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the company specifying the respective event of default. holders of the notes may enforce the agreement or the notes as provided in the agreement. the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the company may waive any existing default or event of default and its consequences under the agreement except a continuing default or event of default in the payment of interest or liquidated damages on, or the principal of, the notes. 12. no recourse against others. no director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the parent, the company or any subsidiary guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the parent, the company or the subsidiary guarantors under the notes, the agreement, the guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. the waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. the waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. the company shall furnish to any holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the agreement. requests may be made to: insight health services corp. 4400 macarthur blvd. suite 800 newport beach, california 92660 attention:

provided that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification. the company, the guarantors and the initial purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 9. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 9, the initial purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the discount received by the initial purchaser in connection with the securities distributed by them. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to 28 contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. for purposes of this section 9, each director, officer and employee of the initial purchaser and each person, if any, who controls the initial purchaser within the meaning of the securities act and the exchange act shall have the same rights to contribution as the initial purchaser, and each director of holdings and the company and each person, if any, who controls holdings and the company within the meaning of the securities act and the exchange act shall have the same rights to contribution as holdings and the company. section 10.

we have participated in various conferences with the officers and other representatives of the company and its independent certified public accountants. in some conferences you and your counsel also participated. at those conferences, the contents of the offering memorandum and prospectus were discussed and revised. since the dates of those conferences, we have inquired of certain officers whether there has been any material change in the affairs of the company. because of the inherent limitations in the independent verification of factual matters, and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of offering memoranda under the securities act, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, and make no representation that we have independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the offering memorandum, other than to the extent set forth in paragraphs (xiv) and (xv) above. also, we do not express

to the attention of the attorneys of this firm who have been engaged in the representation of the company in connection with the company's issuance and sale of the notes that leads us to believe that the offering memorandum, as of its date or at the closing date, contained or contains an untrue statement of material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. a-5 exhibit b form of opinion of general counsel for the company (i) the statements in the offering

counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for, and makes no representation that such counsel has independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the offering memorandum (other than as specified above), and any supplements or amendments thereto, subject to the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention which would lead such counsel to believe that either the offering memorandum, as of its date or at the closing date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need

healthcare costs" and "business--government regulation," insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal or regulatory matters or legal or regulatory proceedings referred to therein, have been reviewed by such counsel, are correct in all material respects and do not omit a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading. the statements under the captions "business--government regulation" and "--reimbursement of healthcare costs" in the annual report of the company on form 10-k for the year ended june 30, 2001 incorporated by reference in the offering memorandum, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal or regulatory matters or legal or regulatory proceedings referred to therein, have been reviewed by such counsel, are correct
