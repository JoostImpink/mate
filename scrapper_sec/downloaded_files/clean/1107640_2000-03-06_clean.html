(6) one (1) qualified sonera designee designated by sonera and its permitted affiliate transferees so long as such entities beneficially own at least 4,500,000 shares; provided, however, that if the aerial reorganization is consummated and sonera beneficially owns more than 9,800,000 shares and tds beneficially owns less than 4,500,000 shares, the number of qualified sonera designees that sonera will be entitled to designate will be two (2); (7) if the aerial reorganization is consummated and tds and voicestream holdings execute the agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit a whereby tds becomes a party to this agreement as a stockholder, one (1) qualified tds designee designated by tds and its permitted affiliate transferees so long as such entities beneficially own at least 4,500,000 shares, such director to be appointed to the board by action of the board by the later of (x) the closing of the aerial reorganization or (y) promptly after tds designates a qualified tds designee; provided, however, that if tds beneficially owns more than 9,800,000 shares and sonera beneficially owns less than 4,500,000 shares, the number of qualified tds designees that tds will be entitled to designate will be two (2);

(b) if at any time john stanton (and his permitted affiliate transferees) shall cease to beneficially own at least 4,500,000 shares, then in such event, john stanton (or, if john stanton has transferred all of his shares to permitted affiliate transferees of john stanton, his permitted affiliate transferees) shall not be entitled to designate any member of the board (except that stanton shall continue to serve on the board for so long as he holds the office of chief executive officer of voicestream holdings); (c) if at any time hutchison pcs (and its permitted affiliate transferees) shall cease to beneficially own at least (i) 9,800,000 shares, then in such event hutchison pcs and its permitted affiliate transferees shall be entitled to designate only one member of the board; and (ii) 4,500,000 shares, then in such event, hutchison pcs and its permitted affiliate transferees shall not be entitled to designate any member of the board. in addition, if hutchison pcs shall have designated additional director(s) by reason of an increase in its percentage ownership as set forth in section 3(a)(iii) above, and at any time thereafter the percentage ownership of hutchison pcs (and its permitted affiliate transferees) shall decrease, (i) the number of designees hutchison pcs (and its permitted affiliate transferees) are entitled to designate to the board shall be reduced so that the percentage of the entire board represented by hutchison pcs's (and its permitted affiliate transferees') designees (rounded to the nearest whole number) shall be proportionate to hutchison pcs's (and its permitted affiliate transferees') aggregate percentage ownership, (ii) any members designated by hutchison pcs (and its permitted affiliate transferees) in excess of such number shall be removed from the board (any such members to be removed to be designated by hutchison or, in the event that hutchison fails to designate the members to be removed, by a majority of the members of the board), and (iii) the board shall be reduced in size by the number of members so removed; (d) if at any time sonera (and its permitted affiliate transferees) shall cease to beneficially own at least (i) 9,800,000 shares at a time when sonera is entitled to designate two (2) directors, then in such event, sonera (or, if sonera has transferred all of its shares to permitted affiliate transferees of sonera, its permitted affiliate transferees) shall be entitled to designate only one (1) member of the board; and (ii) 4,500,000 shares, then in such event, sonera (or, if sonera has transferred all of its shares to permitted affiliate transferees of sonera, its permitted affiliate transferees) shall not be entitled to designate any member of the board; (e) if the aerial reorganization is consummated and tds and voicestream holdings execute an agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit a whereby tds becomes a party to this agreement as a stockholder, and at any time thereafter tds (and its permitted affiliate transferees) shall cease to beneficially own at least (i) 9,800,000 shares at a time when tds is entitled to designate two (2) directors, then in such event, tds (or, if tds has transferred all of its shares to permitted affiliate transferees of tds, its permitted affiliate transferees) shall be entitled to designate only one (1) member of the board; and (ii) 4,500,000 shares, then in such event, tds (or, if tds has transferred all of its shares to permitted affiliate transferees of tds, its permitted affiliate transferees) shall not be entitled to designate any member of the board; (f) any vacancies on the board created by reason of the provisions of subsections (a) through (e) above shall be filled by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office (unless such directors determine to reduce the size of the board after a vacancy is created) to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders of voicestream holdings, and at the next annual meeting shall be filled by a vote of a plurality of all shareholders of voicestream holdings (including the stockholders and their permitted affiliate transferees); provided, however, that in the event that the size of the board shall have increased by reason of hutchison pcs having the right to designate additional director(s) and thereafter hutchison pcs shall cease to have the right to so designate such additional director(s), the size of the board shall be appropriately reduced and each of the stockholders (and each of their respective permitted affiliate transferees ) agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares then beneficially owned by it (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), in person or by proxy (and, shall take all other necessary or desirable actions within such stockholder's (or its permitted affiliate transferees') control including attendance at meetings in person or by proxy for purposes of obtaining a quorum and execution of written consents in lieu of meetings), to cause such reduction in the board. (g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, hutchison's right to transfer its right to designate directors to certain block transferees as set forth in sections 14 and 15 of the shareholders agreement of voicestream wireless corporation, dated february 17, 1998, as amended, among western wireless corporation, a washington corporation, voicestream and hutchison pcs, shall continue in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with the terms of such shareholders agreement. (2) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a stockholder shall cease to have the right to designate any director to the board pursuant to this agreement, such stockholder shall be released in full from all obligations and shall cease to have any rights under this agreement; provided, however, that at the time that the omnipoint designees no longer serve on the board and there is no further obligation to designate omnipoint designees under section 3(a)(v) hereof, the following persons shall be released in full from all obligations and shall cease to have any rights under this agreement: allen & company incorporated, avance capital, avance capital ii, avance capital iii, madison dearborn capital partners, l.p., james n. perry, jr., douglas g. smith, douglas g. smith grat, richard l. fields, james j. ross and james j. ross, as trustee. section 4. voicestream holdings and stockholder covenants. ---------------------------------------------- (1) voicestream holdings hereby agrees to use all reasonable efforts to give effect to the provisions of section 3 hereof. in this regard, voicestream holdings shall, subject to the provisions of section 3 hereof, duly nominate the designees set forth above, or as may otherwise be designated by a party hereto pursuant to the terms of section 3 hereof, for election to the board and shall include in any proxy solicitation materials related to the election of members of the board such information and recommendations of the board as are appropriate, in proxy solicitation materials.
