stock. the foregoing description of the investment agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the investment agreement, a copy of which is attached here as exhibit 2. certificates of designations on may 3, 2017, the company filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware (i) a certificate of the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the series a preferred stock (the &ldquo; series a certificate of designations &rdquo;) and (ii) a certificate of the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the series a-1 preferred stock (the &ldquo; series a-1 certificate of designations &rdquo; and, together with the series a certificate of designations, the &ldquo; certificates of designations &rdquo;). generally, except with respect to certain voting rights, and a conversion trigger applicable to the series a-1 preferred stock described below as the &ldquo;hsr conversion,&rdquo; the rights, preferences and privileges of the series a preferred stock and the series a-1 preferred stock are substantially identical. the preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. in addition, cumulative preferred dividends accumulate on the preferred stock at a rate of 3.875% per annum, and are payable quarterly in arrears. the payments on such dividends may be paid in cash or, at the company&rsquo;s option, in shares of common stock. the company may only pay such dividends in shares of common stock on or after august 1, 2018, subject to an aggregate share cap and so long as the company has paid full cumulative dividends on the preferred stock for all past dividend periods, and there is adequate current public information with respect to the company and no volume limitations would apply to the resale of such shares, in each case under rule 144 of the securities act of 1933. the preferred stock is convertible by the holders of the series preferred stock, at their option, at any time before may 3, 2024, into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of 27.77778 shares of common stock per share of preferred stock (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $36.00 per share of common stock), subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. if at any time after may 3, 2020, the closing sale price of common stock exceeds 150% of the then applicable conversion price of the preferred stock for page 13 of 15 at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days, the company may cause some or all of the preferred stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. upon the conversion of the preferred stock into common stock, the company is required to pay all accumulated but unpaid dividends in additional shares of common stock valued at the then applicable conversion price on the date of such conversion. holders of series a preferred stock (but not the series a-1 preferred stock) are entitled to vote generally with the holders of common stock on an as-converted basis. holders of series a preferred stock are also entitled to certain limited special approval rights, including with respect to amendments to the company&rsquo;s organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the series a preferred stock, certain issuances of senior or pari passu securities, certain purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of junior securities or payments, dividends or distributions thereon. in addition, so long as any shares of series a preferred stock (but not the series a-1 preferred stock) are outstanding and ov and its affiliates collectively beneficially own at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock beneficially owned by such holders immediately following the closing, the holders of series a preferred stock, voting as a separate class by majority vote, are entitled to elect one director to serve on the board. with certain exceptions, upon a fundamental change (as defined in the certificates of designations), holders of the preferred stock may require that the company repurchase for cash all or any whole number of shares of the preferred stock at a per-share repurchase price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of such shares, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. if the company fails to effect such repurchase, the dividend rate on the preferred stock will increase by 1% per annum and an additional 1% per annum on each anniversary of the date that the company is required to effect such repurchase, during the period in which such failure to effect the repurchase is continuing, except that the dividend rate will not increase to more than 6.875% per annum. the definition of fundamental change includes a sale of substantially all the company&rsquo;s assets, a change of control of the company by way of a tender offer, merger or similar event, the adoption of a plan relating to the company&rsquo;s liquidation or dissolution and certain delistings of the company&rsquo;s common stock, except in certain cases described in the certificates of designations in which the consideration received or to be received by the company&rsquo;s common stockholders in a sale or change of control transaction consists primarily of publicly listed and traded securities. holders of shares of preferred stock that are converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the certificates of designations), are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate for such shares of preferred stock based on the effective date of such event and the applicable price attributable to the event as set forth in a table contained in the certificates of designations. the definition of make-whole fundamental change includes a sale of substantially all the company&rsquo;s assets, a change of control of the company by way of a tender offer, merger or similar event, the adoption of a plan relating to the company&rsquo;s liquidation or dissolution and certain delistings of its common stock. if any shares of preferred stock have not been converted into common stock prior to may 3, 2024 (the &ldquo; maturity date &rdquo;), the company will be required to repurchase such shares at a repurchase price equal to the liquidation preference of the repurchased shares plus the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. if the company fails to effect such repurchase, the dividend rate on the preferred stock will increase by 1% per annum and an additional 1% per annum on each anniversary of the maturity date during the period in which such failure to effect the repurchase is continuing, except that the dividend rate will not increase to more than 6.875% per annum. pursuant to the certificates of designations and the investment agreement, the company has, to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law, renounced any interest or expectancy in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be a corporate opportunity for the company, on the one hand, and for ov, its director designees or their respective affiliates, as well as their respective principals, directors, general partners, officers, employees, agents and representatives acting on their behalf, on the other, except to the extent of any such opportunity which is expressly offered to, or comes to the knowledge of, any of such persons solely in his or her capacity as a member of the board. holders of series a-1 preferred stock have no voting rights except as required by law and with respect to amendments to the company&rsquo;s organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the series a-1 preferred page 14 of 15 stock. at such time as any waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 applicable to ov&rsquo;s acquisition of the preferred stock expires or is terminated, all shares of the series a-1 preferred stock then issued and outstanding shall immediately and automatically convert on a one for one basis to shares of series a preferred stock (the &ldquo; hsr conversion &rdquo;). upon such hsr conversion, all accumulated but unpaid dividends on such shares of series a-1 preferred stock immediately prior to such hsr conversion will be converted into an equivalent amount of accumulated but unpaid dividends on shares of series a preferred stock immediately following such hsr conversion. the foregoing descriptions of the series a certificate of designations and the series a-1 certificates of designations do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full texts of the series a certificate of designations and the series a-1 certificates of designations, copies of
