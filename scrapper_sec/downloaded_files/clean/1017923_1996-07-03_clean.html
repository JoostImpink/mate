(2) if no two (2) appraisers agree upon such value, then the "fair market value" of the subject assets shall be determined in the following manner: (a) if the highest value set by one appraiser is not more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the next lower value set by another appraiser and the lowest value set by one appraiser is not less than ninety percent (90%) of the next higher value set by another appraiser, then the values set by the three appraisers shall be added together and divided by three, and the resulting amount shall represent the fair market value of the subject assets for purposes of this section 8.3. (b) if the highest value set by one appraiser is more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the next lower value set by another appraiser, then the highest value shall be reduced to an amount equal to said one hundred ten percent (110%) figure; and if 19 the lowest value set by one appraiser is less than ninety percent (90%) of the next higher value set by another appraiser, then the lowest value shall be increased to an amount equal to said ninety percent (90%) figure. the three values, adjusted as provided above, shall be added together and divided by three, and the resulting amount shall represent the fair market value of the subject assets for purposes of this section 8.3. (c) upon receipt of the appraisals, the independent certified public accountant of the partnership shall make the final calculation as to the fair market value of the subject assets and of the purchase price for purposes of the provisions of this agreement that necessitated such appraisal. the accountant shall notify the partners in writing of its calculation within ten (10) days after the date of receipt of the appraisals prepared by the appraisers. the calculation of the accountant as to the fair market value of the subject assets and the amount of the purchase price shall be binding upon the partners. the cost of such appraisals shall be shared equally by the purchasing partner and the selling partner. 8.4 manner of payment for ownership interest. in the event of the occurrence of any of the events set forth in section 8.1, the purchasing partner may elect to pay all or a portion of the purchase price in cash or in installments. if a purchasing partner elects to pay in cash, then the purchase price shall be paid in full in cash within sixty (60) days after the date on which the option is exercised in accordance with section 8.2. if a purchasing partner elects to pay all or a portion of the purchase price in installments, then the initial payment of the purchase price shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the purchase price. such initial payment shall be paid within sixty (60) days after the exercise of such option under the terms of section 8.2. the balance of the purchase price shall be paid in equal annual installments in an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) multiplied by the purchase price, payable on each successive anniversary date of the initial payment, plus all interest on the balance accruing at the lesser of (a) a variable annual rate equal to the prime rate plus two percent (2%), or (b) the maximum lawful rate of interest, from the date of the initial payment, until the entire balance of the deferred purchase price is paid in full. the deferred portion of the purchase price shall be evidenced by an installment note, secured by the portion of the ownership interest being purchased, or such other collateral as may be mutually acceptable to both parties. such note and security agreement will be executed by the purchasing partner and delivered to the selling partner at the time 20 for the initial payment of the purchase price. any installment note executed hereunder shall contain provisions for prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time, without penalty or premium. 8.5 liquidation of assets. on the effective date of the dissolution of the partnership, rcp (or j/t if rcp causes such dissolution) shall be appointed as agent of the dissolved partnership in liquidation, and of the partners, for winding up all partnership affairs and all business transactions of the partnership (the "liquidating trustee"). the liquidating trustee shall continue to serve until the completion of the winding up and liquidation, unless bankruptcy, insolvency or resignation shall intervene. the liquidating trustee shall not be paid for its services after the dissolution of the partnership and the winding up for liquidating operations. it may, out of the assets and proceeds of the assets on hand, employ such assistance as it determines appropriate, and it may employ and pay any one of the partners to take any such actions and render any such services in the winding up and liquidation. 8.6 distributlon of proceeds from liquidation. in the event of dissolution of the partnership, the business affairs of the partnership shall be wound up and liquidated as promptly as business circumstances and orderly business practices will permit. the proceeds of liquidation and all partnership cash shall be distributed in the following order: (a) first, to partnership creditors (excluding the partners) funds, to the extent that they are available, sufficient to extinguish current partnership liabilities and obligations, including the costs and expenses of liquidation;
