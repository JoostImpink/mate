(b) the purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the company, any other purchasers, any underwriter (as defined in the securities act) and each person, if any, who controls the company, such other purchasers or any underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint and several, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and reasonable costs of investigation) to which the company, such other purchaser, underwriter or such controlling person may be subject, under the securities act or otherwise, insofar as any thereof arise out of or are based upon (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement, a prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (y) the omission or alleged omission to state in any item referred to in the preceding clause a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (z) any failure of the purchaser to perform its obligations hereunder or under law; provided, however, that the purchaser will be liable hereunder in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in strict conformity with information pertaining to the purchaser, as such, furnished in writing to the company by the purchaser stated to be specifically for use in such registration statement and prospectus; provided, further, however, that the liability of the purchaser hereunder shall be limited to the proportion of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense which is equal to the proportion that the public offering price of the shares or registered securities sold by the purchaser under such registration statement bears to the total public offering price of all securities sold thereunder, but not in any event to exceed the proceeds received by the purchaser from the sale of the shares or registered securities covered by such registration statement. the foregoing is subject to the condition that, insofar as the foregoing indemnities relate to any untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission made in any prospectus which is eliminated or remedied in any amendment, supplement or final prospectus, the above indemnity obligations of the purchaser shall not inure to the benefit of any indemnified person (or to the benefit of any person who controls such indemnified person within the meaning of the securities act) if a copy of such amendment, supplement or final prospectus was not sent or given by such indemnified person at or prior to the time such action is required of such indemnified person by the securities act and if delivery of such amendment, supplement or final prospectus would have eliminated (or been a sufficient defense to) any liability of such indemnified person with respect to such statement or omission. (c) promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under section 8.9(a) or (b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 8.9 unless such failure to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party's defense. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of separate counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties. in addition, an indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify, reimburse, or otherwise make any contribution to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party for any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities incurred by the indemnified party in settlement of any actions, proceedings or investigations otherwise covered hereunder, unless such settlement has been previously approved by the indemnifying party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. (d) if the indemnification provided for in this section 8.9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under section 8.9(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only (i) the relative benefits received by the purchaser on the one hand and the underwriter on the other from the offering of the shares or the registered securities but also (ii) the relative fault of the company, the purchaser and the underwriter in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the purchaser on the one hand and the underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the purchaser bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact related to information supplied by the company, the purchaser or the underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) the company and the purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this section 8.9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if several underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this section 8.9. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this section 8.9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 8.9, no underwriter, if any, will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount agreed to between the company and the underwriter at the time of such offering. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. any underwriters' obligations to contribute will be several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (f) in any proceeding relating to a registration statement, a prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this section 8.9 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party. 8.10. transferees. the right to sell shares and registered securities pursuant to a registration statement described herein will automatically be assigned to each transferee of shares or registered securities, other than any purchaser of shares or registered securities sold under a registration statement. in the event that it is necessary, in order to permit a purchaser to sell shares or registered securities pursuant to a registration statement, to amend or supplement the registration statement to name such transferee, such transferee shall, upon written notice to the company, be entitled to have the company make such amendment or supplement as soon as reasonably practicable. section 9. conditions to purchaser's obligations the purchaser's obligation to purchase
