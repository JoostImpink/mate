(b) the investor will, if registrable securities held by the investor are included in the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is being effected, indemnify the company, each of its directors and officers, each underwriter, if any, of the company's securities covered by such a registration statement, and each person who controls the company or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the company, such directors, officers, persons, underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other page 42 of 50 expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by an instrument duly executed by the investor and stated to be specifically for use therein. notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of the investor under this subsection (b) and subsection (d) shall be limited in an amount equal to the net proceeds received by the investor from sales of registrable securities pursuant to such registration statement, unless such liability arises out of or is based on willful misconduct by the investor. (c) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.4 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such party's expense, and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2 unless the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an indemnifying party's ability to defend such action and provided further, that the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or separate and different defenses. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

or (ii) by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this section 2.4(d). the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in section 2.4(b) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 2.5 termination of registration rights. the rights granted pursuant to this agreement shall terminate at such time as rule 144 will permit the investor to sell all the shares held by it in a single 90 day period or seven (7) years after the date of this agreement, whichever occurs first. 2.6 information by holder. the investor shall furnish to the company such information regarding the investor, the registrable securities held by it and the distribution proposed by the investor as the company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this section 2. 2.7 rule 144 reporting. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may at any time permit the sale of the registrable securities to the public without registration, the company agrees to use its best efforts to: (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act, at all times;
