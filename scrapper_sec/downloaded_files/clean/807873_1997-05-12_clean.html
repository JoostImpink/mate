securities and exchange commission washington, d.c. 20549 schedule 13d under the securities exchange act of 1934 item 1. security and issuer. this statement on schedule 13d (this "schedule 13d") relates to the common stock, $.01 par value per share ("common stock") of gensia sicor inc., a delaware corporation (the "company"). the company's principal executive offices are located at 9360 towne centre drive, san diego, california 92121. although no person identified in item 2 has acquired any shares of common stock, each of the persons filing this schedule 13d is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of common stock reported with respect to such person in item 5 by virtue of its acquisition of beneficial ownership of the company's 2.675% subordinated convertible notes due may 1, 2004 (the "notes") and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. as described herein, the notes are convertible into either the company's series a convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "preferred stock"), or the common stock and the preferred stock is convertible into the common stock. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is filed on behalf of health care capital partners, l.p. ("hccp"). hccp is a delaware limited partnership and is referred to as the "filer." the general partner of the filer is ferrer freeman thompson & co. llc, a connecticut limited liability company. the business of the filer is to achieve long term capital appreciation through privately negotiated equity and equity- oriented investments, including, but not limited to, common stock, preferred stock, warrants and convertible securities exclusively in the health care industry. the business address of hccp and fft (and each of the members and executive officers of fft set forth in schedule i) is set forth in the cover page hereof. for information with respect to the identity and background of each member and executive officer of fft, see schedule i hereto. during the past five years, neither the filer nor, to the best knowledge of the filer, fft or any person identified on schedule i, has (i) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or (ii) been party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. all persons identified in schedule i are united states citizens. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. on may 1, 1997, the company and hccp entered into a securities purchase agreement (the "securities purchase agreement") providing for the purchase on the closing date (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) by hccp of the notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $20,000,000, and warrants to purchase 2,645,503 shares of common stock (the "warrants"). the total purchase price for the notes and warrants is $20,000,000. as more fully described in item 4 below, the warrants are not exercisable as to 50% of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants until the third anniversary of the closing date (as defined below) and then only if certain conditions are met. a copy of the securities purchase agreement (the "securities purchase agreement") is attached hereto as exhibit 1. the source of funds used for the purchase of the notes and the warrants reported in this schedule 13d was available committed capital of hccp. item 4. purpose of transaction. the filer has acquired the notes and warrants beneficially owned by it as an investment and in the ordinary course of business. the filer intends to review on a continuing basis its investment in the company, including the company's business, financial condition and operating results and general market and industry conditions and, based upon such review, may (i) convert the notes or exercise the warrants in whole or in part, or (ii) dispose of the notes or warrants or, if after conversion of the notes or exercise of the warrants, the preferred stock or common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the powers, rights and privileges of the holders of the notes are described in the securities purchase agreement. each note or any portion of the outstanding principal amount thereof is convertible, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, after the closing of the notes purchased (the "closing date") into shares of common stock at a conversion ratio (a "conversion ratio") obtained by dividing each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes by a conversion price equal to $3.78 (the "conversion price"). the closing date is expected to be on may 16, 1997. any conversion by the holders of notes must be in an aggregate principal amount equal to at least $100,000, unless the amount so converted shall be such holder's entire outstanding principal amount of notes. at the direction of the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of all outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, the notes will be converted in whole, but not in part, into shares of preferred stock at a conversion ratio of one share of preferred stock for each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes. following notice of redemption by the company, each note or any portion of the outstanding principal amount thereof is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock at the applicable conversion ratio as more fully described in the securities purchase agreement. under certain circumstances described in the securities purchase agreement, the notes may be converted in whole by the company into shares of preferred stock at a conversion ratio of one share of preferred stock for each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes. the powers, rights and privileges of the preferred stock are described in the form of company's certificate of designation of series a convertible preferred stock (the "series a certificate of designation") attached as exhibit e to the securities purchase agreement. holders of shares of preferred stock, in preference to the holders of shares of common stock and of any shares of other capital stock of the company ranking junior to the preferred stock as to payment of dividends, are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, out of assets legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate equal to 2.675% from and after the date of issuance of the preferred stock, so long as shares of preferred stock remain outstanding. each share of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock at the conversion ratio applicable for conversion of the notes as more fully described in the series a certificate of designation. any conversion by holders of the preferred stock shall be in an aggregate amount with a stated value equal to at least $100,000 on all shares of preferred stock of such holder. the powers, rights and privileges of the warrants are described in the form of warrant to purchase shares of common stock of the company, attached as exhibit b to the securities purchase agreement. at any time after the closing date, and until may 1, 2004, the holder of the warrants may exercise the warrants for all or any part of the number of shares of common stock purchasable thereunder at the warrant exercise price of $4.347, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the warrants (the "current warrant price"); provided, however, that the warrants are not exercisable as to 50% of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants until (a) after the third anniversary of the closing date and (b) then only if the current market price (as defined in the warrant) of the common stock does not exceed the current warrant price by 250% or more for 90 consecutive trading days and no change of control (as such term is used in the securities purchase agreement) has occurred (such contingent warrants referred to as "contingent warrants"). from and after the third anniversary of the closing date, any portion of the contingent warrants which are then exercisable and have not previously been exercised shall expire upon the occurrence of a change of control. the conversion ratio, the conversion ratio for the preferred stock and the exercise price in connection with, and the number of shares exercisable under, the warrants are subject to certain antidilution adjustments contained in the securities purchase agreement, the series a certificate of designation and the warrants. the notes and shares of preferred stock are redeemable, on or after 18 months after the closing date, in whole and not in part, if the current market price (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) per share of the common stock exceeds the conversion price, multiplied by 350% for at least 90 consecutive trading days, subject to the following sentence, at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note or the outstanding stated value of the preferred stock, as the case may be, plus all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption (the "redemption price"). in the event that at any time a change of control occurs prior to a redemption pursuant to the above sentence, the redemption price of each note or each share of preferred stock, as the case may be, shall be equal to the change of control price as defined in the securities purchase agreement and the series a certificate of designation. the notes and the shares of preferred stock must be redeemed on may 1, 2004. as further described in the securities purchase agreement and the series a certificate of designation, if (i) on any date interest payable on the notes or dividends payable on the preferred stock have been in arrears, (ii) material breaches of certain covenants contained in the securities purchase agreement (including covenants relating to maintenance of minimum consolidated tangible net worth and the debt-tangible net worth ratio) have occurred and are continuing after notice and an opportunity to cure have been given, (iii) the company has failed to redeem the notes or the preferred stock on a date fixed for mandatory redemption, (iv) indebtedness with a principal amount of more than $3,000,000 is accelerated or there occurs under a swap contract an early termination date (as such terms are defined in the securities purchase agreement) due to certain circumstance as specified in the securities purchase agreement, (v) in the case of the notes, any other "event of default" as defined in the securities purchase agreement has occurred and is continuing, or (vi) in the case of the preferred stock, a fundamental change (as defined in the company's certificate of incorporation) has occurred then, in any such case, the holders of notes or preferred stock will be entitled to interest on the notes, or dividends on the preferred stock, at a rate of 11.75% per annum. in case of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, holders of notes are entitled to receive the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date and holders of preferred stock are entitled to receive the stated value per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, before any distribution is made to holders of securities ranking junior to the notes or preferred stock, as the case may be. pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the company has agreed that its board of directors will take all necessary action to elect to the board a person reasonably acceptable to the board designated by hccp and, so long as any of hccp or fft shall beneficially own $10,000,000 of aggregate principal amount of the notes or of stated value of the preferred stock, at each annual meeting for the election of the class of directors which includes such designee, to nominate and recommend for election to the board of directors of the company a person designated by hccp who is reasonably acceptable to the board of directors of the company. except as set forth above, neither the filer nor, to the best knowledge of the filer, any person identified in item 2 of this schedule 13d, has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in the types of transactions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) hccp is deemed to beneficially own 6,613,756 shares of common stock by virtue of its right to acquire beneficial ownership of such shares within 60 days through (i) the conversion of the notes (which are convertible into 5,291,005 shares of common stock) and (ii) the exercise of the portion of the warrants which are not contingent warrants (such currently exercisable warrants exercisable for 1,322,751 shares of common stock). assuming the conversion of the notes and the exercise of 50% of the warrants, the 6,613,756 shares of common stock beneficially owned by the filer represents, to the best of the filer's knowledge, 8.17% of the outstanding common stock. (b) the responses of the filer to items 7 through 11 and item 13 on the cover page of this schedule 13d relating to beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock are incorporated herein by reference. (c) except as set forth above, neither the filer nor, to the best of its knowledge, fft and any person identified in schedule i, beneficially owns any shares of common stock or has effected any transactions in shares of common stock during the preceding 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and the series a certificate of designation, the holders of the notes and the shares of preferred stock have certain additional rights and are subject to certain restrictions. each share of preferred stock is entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the company, voting together as a single class with the common stock, with each share of preferred stock having a number of votes equal to the votes which could be cast by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible. as described in the series a certificate of designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock is necessary to (i) authorize, increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any shares of any class or series within a class of the company's capital stock ranking prior to (either as to dividends or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up) the preferred stock (other than the shares of participating preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the rights (as defined in the series a certificate of designation)); (ii) increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any shares of preferred stock or (iii) authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the company's certificate of incorporation or the series a certificate of designation which would increase or decrease the par value of the shares of preferred stock or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the preferred stock so as to affect such shares of preferred stock adversely. if within 6 months following redemption of the notes or the preferred stock, there is (i) a merger, consolidation or reorganization following which the beneficial owners of the company prior to such event do not beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the company, (ii) an acquisition of more than 50% of the capital stock, assets or property of the company by any person or group within the meaning of section 13(d) of the exchange act, (iii) a liquidation of the company approved by the board of directors of the company or (iv) a public announcement of any of the transactions specified in (i) through (iii) above and such transaction is consummated within six months of such public announcement, the company must promptly pay to the record holders of the notes or preferred stock on the date of redemption, an amount in respect of each share into which such notes or preferred stock were convertible as of the date of redemption, equal to the excess, if any, of (x), in the case of the transactions described in (i) and (iii), the fair market value (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) of the consideration per share of common stock received or receivable in such transaction by the company or the holders of the company's capital stock or (y), in the case of the transactions described in (ii), the current market price (as defined in the securities purchase agreement) for the five trading days preceding the consummation of the transaction over the redemption price or, if higher than (x) or (y), the consideration per share of common stock received by certain related parties specified in the securities purchase agreement. the company has agreed to file a notification and report form under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 (the "hsr act") with respect to the securities of the company acquired by hccp not later than july 31, 1998, and has agreed not to deliver any notice of redemption or conversion to hccp unless (i) the company has previously filed under the hsr act, (ii) the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated and (iii) the date fixed for redemption or conversion is a date on which hccp would not be prohibited from owning voting securities of the company. under the registration rights agreement attached as exhibit d to the securities purchase agreement, the holders of registerable securities (as defined in the registration rights agreement) representing not less than 25% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants (excluding contingent warrants not then exercisable or which have expired) may, after august 28, 1998, request that the company effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of such holder's registerable securities, provided that the current market value of such offering shall exceed $5 million. the company is not required to effect more than three demand registrations during the term of the registration rights agreement or more than two demand registrations in any twelve month period. in addition, if the company proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act by registration on forms s-1, s-2 or s-3, the company will use its best efforts to effect registration of the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the notes, the preferred stock, or the warrants requested to be included in such registration by hccp. the foregoing descriptions of the securities purchase agreement, the series a certificate of designation, the warrant and the registration rights agreement are qualified in their entirety by the complete texts of such documents (including appendices thereto), copies of which are attached hereto as either an exhibit hereto or as an exhibit to the securities purchase agreement attached hereto as exhibit 1 and are incorporated herein by reference.

(a) any conversion by the holders of notes into common stock shall be in an aggregate outstanding principal amount equal to at least $100,000, unless the amount so converted shall be such holder's entire outstanding principal amount of notes. conversion of the notes may be effected by any holder thereof upon the surrender to the company at the office of the company designated for notices in accordance with section 13.6 or at the office of any agent or agents of the company, as may be designated by the board of directors (the "transfer agent"), of the notes to be converted, accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified portion of the outstanding principal amount of such notes in accordance with the provisions of this article 10 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of preferred stock or common stock, as the case may be, to be issued; provided that, in the case of the conversion of the notes into preferred stock in accordance with section 10.3, the company shall provide each holder written notice stating that such holder's notes have been converted pursuant to section 10.3, and each holder shall thereupon promptly surrender to the transfer agent the notes so converted specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificates for shares of preferred stock to be issued. in case any holder's notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of preferred stock or common stock in such name or names. other than such taxes, the company will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of preferred stock or common stock on conversion of notes pursuant hereto. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of such notes and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the company that such taxes have been paid), the company shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of preferred stock or common stock, as the case may be, to which the holder of the notes being converted shall be entitled and (ii) if less than the entire outstanding principal amount of any note surrendered is being converted, a new note in the principal amount which remains outstanding upon such partial conversion. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of giving such notice so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the note or notes (or portion thereof) being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of preferred stock or common stock, as the case may be, in accordance herewith, and the person entitled to receive the shares of preferred stock or common stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of preferred stock or common stock at such time, so long as such holder's notes are delivered to the company within two business days after the date of the giving of notice. in any other case of conversion at the holder's option, the date of delivery of the notes shall be deemed to be the date of conversion. (b) in case any notes are to be redeemed pursuant to section 9.1, such right of conversion shall cease and terminate as to the notes to be redeemed at the close of business on the business day preceding the date fixed for redemption unless the company shall default in the payment of the redemption price or the change of control price, as the case may be. (c) the conversion ratio shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in certain instances as hereinafter provided. 10.5. fractions of shares; interest. in connection with the conversion of any note into common stock, no fractions of shares shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of common stock on the trading day on which such note is deemed to have been converted. if more than one note shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes so surrendered. promptly upon conversion, the company shall pay to holders of notes so converted an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest on the notes surrendered for conversion to the date of such conversion, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share of common stock. 10.6. reservation of stock. (a) the company shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants, free from any preemptive rights, such number of its authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and common stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes into preferred stock or common stock and permit the exercise of all of the warrants, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of preferred stock or common stock, if necessary, to permit the conversion of the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes and permit the exercise of all of the warrants. (b) if the company shall issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the notes as contemplated by this article 10, or upon exercise of the warrants, the company shall issue together with each such share of common stock one right (or other securities in lieu thereof), or any rights issued to holders of common stock in addition thereto or in replacement therefor, whether or not such rights shall be exercisable at such time, but only if such rights are issued and outstanding and held by other holders of common stock at such time and have not expired. 10.7. adjustment of conversion ratio. the conversion ratio will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (a) in case the company shall at any time or from time to time after may 1, 1997 (a) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, on the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or (d) issue by reclassification of the shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the company, then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any note thereafter surrendered for conversion into common stock shall be entitled to receive, for each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes, the number of shares of common stock or other securities of the company which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such notes been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the happening of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (a) shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of such subdivision, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (a) in connection with any transaction to which section 10.8 applies. (b) in case the company shall issue shares of common stock (or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) after may 1, 1997 at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the conversion price as of the date of issuance of such shares (or, in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities, less than the conversion price as of the date of issuance of the rights, warrants or other securities in respect of which shares of common stock were issued), then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio and the conversion price shall be adjusted so that the holder of each note shall be entitled to receive, for each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes, upon the conversion thereof into common stock, the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying (a) the conversion ratio in effect on the day immediately prior to such date by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (2) the number of additional shares of common stock issued (or into which the convertible securities may convert), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (y) the number of shares of common stock purchasable at the then applicable conversion price per share with the aggregate consideration receivable by the company for the total number of shares of common stock so issued (or into which the rights, warrants or other convertible securities may convert). an adjustment made pursuant to this section 10.7(b) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively to the close of business on the date of such issuance. for purposes of this section 10.7(b), the aggregate consideration receivable by the company in connection with the issuance of shares of common stock or of rights, warrants or other securities convertible into shares of common stock shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of the aggregate offering price (before deduction of underwriting discounts or commissions and expenses payable to third parties) of all such common stock, rights, warrants and convertible securities plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise or conversion of any such rights, warrants and convertible securities into shares of common stock. if common stock is sold as a unit with other securities or rights of value, the aggregate consideration received for such common stock shall be deemed to be net of the fair market value of such other securities and rights of value. if common stock is issued in consideration of the release of a claim brought by a shareholder against the company, whether before or after the closing date, on the basis of events or circumstances occurring prior to the closing date ("pre-closing shareholder claims"), the consideration for such common stock shall be deemed to be $0. the issuance or reissuance of any shares of common stock (whether treasury shares or newly issued shares) pursuant to (i) a dividend or distribution on, or subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the outstanding shares of common stock requiring an adjustment in the conversion ratio pursuant to section 10.7(a), (ii) shares issued as stock milestone payments or combination milestone payments pursuant to section 5.06 of the development and marketing agreement dated june 13, 1991 with gensia clinical partners as in effect on the date hereof or pursuant to any acquisition of biofa a.b. on terms approved by the full board of directors or (iii) any restricted stock or stock option plan or program of the company involving the grant of options or rights at below the applicable conversion price (but the company will in no event issue options or rights exercisable at less than 85% of current market price at the date of grant) so long as the granting of such options or rights has been approved by the full board of directors or a committee of the board of directors on which the director designated by the purchaser is a member, or (iv) any option, warrant, right, or convertible security outstanding as of the date hereof (other than the rights or similar securities) shall not be deemed to constitute an issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the company to which this section 10.7(b) applies. upon the expiration unexercised of any options, warrants or rights to convert any convertible securities for which an adjustment has been made pursuant to this section 10.7(b), the adjustments shall forthwith be reversed to effect such rate of conversion as would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such options, warrants or rights or convertible securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such expiration or termination, never been issued. nothing herein shall limit the right of any holder to an anti-dilution adjustment in the event that there shall occur a "flip-in" or "flip-over" event under the rights agreement or any similar plan or agreement of the company. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 10.7(b)in connection with any transaction to which section 10.8 applies. (c) in case the company shall at any time or from time to time after may 1, 1997 declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution (including, without limitation, any distribution of stock or other securities or property or rights or warrants to subscribe for securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries by way of dividend, including any distribution of shares or assets of metabasis or automedics and any payment or granting of anything of value in consideration of the release of a pre-closing shareholder claim, on its common stock, other than dividends or distributions of shares of common stock which are referred to in section 10.7(a) or issuances of common stock which are referred to in section 10.7(b), then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio and the conversion price shall be adjusted so that the holder of each note shall be entitled to receive, upon the conversion thereof, for each $100 of outstanding principal amount of notes, the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying (1) the applicable conversion ratio on the day immediately prior to the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current market price of the common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding such record date, and the denominator of which shall be such current market price of the common stock less the fair market value per share of common stock (as determined in good faith by the board of directors and supported by an opinion from an investment banking firm of recognized national standing acceptable to holders of a majority of the notes) of such dividend or distribution. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this section 10.7(c) in connection with any transaction to which section 10.8 applies. (d) for purposes of this section 10.7, the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include any shares of common stock then owned or held by or for the account of the company. (e) the term "dividend," as used in this section 10.7, shall mean a dividend or other distribution upon stock of the company as well as any consideration granted to a shareholder for the release of a claim against the company. (f) anything in this section 10.7 to the contrary notwithstanding, the company shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment in the conversion ratio unless and until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of which shall be carried forward), determined as above provided, shall have resulted in a change of the conversion ratio by at least one one- hundredth of one share of common stock, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be to change the conversion ratio by at least one one-hundredth of one share of common stock, such change in conversion ratio shall thereupon be given effect. (g) the certificate of any firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing selected by the board of directors (which may be the firm of independent public accountants regularly employed by the company) shall be presumptively correct for any computation made under this section 10.7. (h) if the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the right of conversion granted by this section 10.7 or in the conversion ratio or conversion price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record. (i) in the case of any event which requires an adjustment to the conversion ratio pursuant to this section 10.7, the conversion price shall also be appropriately adjusted to reflect such event. (j) if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this section 10.7 are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the rights of the holders of the notes in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, the board of directors shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such rights of the holders of the notes. 10.8. merger or consolidation. in the case of any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another corporation, or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of all or substantially all of the assets or property of the company (each of the foregoing being referred to as a "transaction") occurring in each case at any time, each note then outstanding shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the common stock issuable upon such conversion prior to consummation of such transaction, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash) upon the consummation of such transaction by a holder of that number of shares of common stock into which the principal balance of such note was convertible immediately prior to such transaction. in case securities or property other than common stock shall be issuable or deliverable upon conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this article 10 shall be deemed to apply, so far as appropriate and nearly as may be, to such other securities or property. 10.9. notice of certain corporate actions. in case at any time or from time to time the company shall pay any stock dividend or make any other non-cash distribution to the holders of its common stock, or shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its common stock any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right, or there shall be any capital reorganization or reclassification of the common stock or consolidation or merger of the company with or into another corporation, or any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the property of the company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, or there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, then, in any one or more of said cases the company shall give at least 20 days' prior written notice (the time of mailing of such notice shall be deemed to be the time of giving thereof) to the registered holders of the notes at the addresses of each as shown in the note register of the date on which (i) a record shall be taken for such stock dividend, distribution or subscription rights or (ii) such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up shall take place, as the case may be, provided that in the case of any transaction to which section 10.7 applies the company shall give at least 30 days' prior written notice as aforesaid. such notice shall also specify the date as of which the holders of the common stock of record shall participate in said dividend, distribution or subscription rights or shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance or participate in such dissolution, liquidation or winding up, as the case may be. failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any action so taken. 10.10. reports as to adjustments. upon any adjustment of the conversion ratio then in effect and any increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the operation of the conversion provisions set forth in this article 10, then, and in each such case, the company shall promptly deliver to the transfer agent of the notes and common stock, a certificate signed by the president or a vice president and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the company setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the conversion ratio then in effect following such adjustment and the increased or decreased number of shares issuable upon the conversion granted by this section 10, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation of each and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. where appropriate, such notice to holders of the notes may be given in advance and included as part of the notice required under the provisions of section 10.9. 11. subordination of notes 11.1. subordination of notes to senior indebtedness. the indebtedness evidenced by the notes and all renewals and extensions thereof, all obligations of the company under this agreement, the certificate of designation, and all other instruments and agreements arising out of or relating to any or all of the foregoing and all renewals and extensions thereof (collectively called the "junior indebtedness") shall at all times be wholly subordinate and junior in right of payment to any and all senior indebtedness of the company (including any claims by the holders of such senior indebtedness for interest accruing after any assignment for the benefit of creditors by the company or the institution by or against the company of any proceedings under the bankruptcy code or any law for the relief of or relating to debtors, or any other claim by such holders for any such interest which would have accrued in the absence of such assignment or the institution of such proceedings) in the manner and with the force and effect hereafter set forth: (a) in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, or of any execution, sale, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, readjustment, reorganization or other similar proceeding relative to the company or its property, all sums owing on all senior indebtedness of the company (including cash collateral and amounts not yet due and payable) shall first be paid in full before any payment is made upon the junior indebtedness; and in any such event any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property, or securities which shall be made upon or in respect of the junior indebtedness shall be paid over to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company, pro rata, for application in payment thereof unless and until such senior indebtedness shall have been paid or satisfied in full. in case of any assignment for the benefit of creditors by the company or in case any proceedings under the bankruptcy code or any other law for the relief of or relating to debtors are instituted by or against the company, or in case of the appointment of any receiver for the company's business or assets, or in case of any dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company, the company and any assignee, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession or other person or persons in charge are hereby directed to pay to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company the full amount of such holders' claims against the company (including interest to the date of payment) before making any payments to the holders of junior indebtedness, and insofar as may be necessary for that purpose, the purchaser hereby assign and transfer to the holders of senior indebtedness of the company all rights to any payments, dividends or other distributions. (b) in the event that all or any part of the junior indebtedness is declared or becomes due and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default or otherwise than at the option of the company (other than pursuant to its terms at its final maturity), under circumstances when the foregoing clause (a) shall not be applicable, the holders of the junior indebtedness shall be entitled to payments only after there shall first have been paid in full all senior indebtedness of the company or payment shall have been provided therefor in a manner satisfactory to the holders of such senior indebtedness. (c) upon the occurrence of an event which is, or with the lapse of time or notice or both would be, an event which gives any holder of any senior indebtedness of the company the right to demand payment, cash collateral, accelerate the maturity, or terminate any commitment to further extend credit, no payment shall be made on any junior indebtedness if either: (i) notice of such default in writing or by telegram has been given to the company by any holder of any senior indebtedness of the company, provided that judicial proceedings shall be commenced with respect to such default (x) within 180 days thereafter if such default consists of the nonpayment of principal, interest, or any other sum due on such senior indebtedness, or (y) within 180 days after the earlier of (i) the giving of such notice or (ii) the date on which such holder is entitled to institute judicial proceedings, or (ii) judicial proceedings shall be pending in respect of such default. the holder of any portion of senior indebtedness of the company shall not be entitled to give notice pursuant to this clause (c) more than once with respect to any default which was specified in such notice and which has continued without interruption since the date such notice was given, nor shall such holder be entitled to give a separate notice with respect to any default not so specified which (to the knowledge of the holder giving notice) was existing on the date such notice was given pursuant to this clause (c) and which has continued without interruption from the date such notice was given. upon receipt of any notice from any holder of any senior indebtedness pursuant to this clause (c), the company shall forthwith send a copy thereof to each holder of junior indebtedness and each holder of its senior indebtedness at the time outstanding. (d) all payments, cash, or noncash distributions made to the holders of junior indebtedness which should have been made to the holders of senior indebtedness of the company shall be received and held by the former in trust for the benefit of the latter, and the holders of junior indebtedness shall forthwith remit such payments, cash, or noncash distributions to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company, pro rata, in the form in which it was received, together with such endorsements or documents as may be necessary to effectively negotiate or transfer the same to the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company. (e) each holder of senior indebtedness of the company is hereby authorized by the purchaser to: (i) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time of payment, or any other terms, of any senior indebtedness of the company held by such holder; (ii) increase or decrease the rate of interest payable thereon or any part thereof; (iii) exchange, enforce, waive or release any security therefor; (iv) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof in such manner as such holder may at its discretion determine; and/or (v) release the company or any guarantor of any senior indebtedness of the company from liability. if any such action is taken, the company shall promptly notify the purchaser and any holder of junior indebtedness. notwithstanding anything set forth in this section 11.1, nothing set forth herein shall restrict holders of the notes and preferred stock from exercising their rights of conversion hereunder. 11.2. proofs of claim of holders of senior indebtedness; voting. the purchaser undertakes and agrees for the benefit of each holder of senior indebtedness of the company to execute, verify, deliver and file any proofs of claim relating to the junior indebtedness which any holder of such senior indebtedness may at any time require in order to prove and realize upon any rights or claims pertaining to the junior indebtedness and to effectuate the full benefit of the subordination contained herein. upon failure of the purchaser to file the required proof or proofs of claim prior to 30 days before the expiration of the time to file claims in such proceeding, each holder of senior indebtedness of the company is hereby irrevocably appointed by the purchaser to be such purchaser's agent to file the appropriate claim or claims and if such holder of senior indebtedness elects at its sole discretion to file such claim or claims (i) to accept or reject any plan of reorganization or arrangement on behalf of the purchaser, and (ii) to otherwise vote the purchaser's claim in respect of the junior indebtedness in any manner deemed appropriate for the benefit and protection of the holders of the senior indebtedness of the company. 11.3. rights of holders of senior indebtedness unimpaired. no right of any holder of any senior indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time or in any way be affected or impaired by any failure to act on the part of the company or the holders of senior indebtedness, or by any noncompliance by the company with any of the terms, provisions and covenants of this agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of senior indebtedness may have or be otherwise charged with. 11.4. effects of event of default. the company agrees, for the benefit of the holders of senior indebtedness, that in the event that a note is declared due and payable before its maturity because of the occurrence of an event of default, (i) the company will give prompt notice in writing of such happening to the holders of senior indebtedness and (ii) all senior indebtedness shall forthwith become immediately due and payable upon demand, regardless of the expressed maturity thereof. 11.5. company's obligations unimpaired. the provisions of this article 11 are solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of senior indebtedness on the one hand, and the purchaser on the other hand, and nothing herein shall impair, as between the company and the purchaser, the obligation of the company which is unconditional and absolute, to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if payable, on the notes in accordance with this agreement and the terms of the notes, nor shall anything herein prevent the purchaser from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or under this agreement or the notes upon the occurrence of an event of default, subject to the rights of the holders of senior indebtedness as herein provided for. 11.6. subrogation. subject to the payment in full of senior indebtedness, holders of the notes shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of senior indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities made on the senior indebtedness until the senior indebtedness shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, payments or distributions to the holders of senior indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which any holder of notes would be entitled except for the provisions of this agreement shall, as between the company and its creditors other than the holders of senior indebtedness and holders of the notes, be deemed to be a payment by the company to or on account of the notes, it being understood that the provisions of this agreement are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of the notes on the one hand, and the holders of senior indebtedness, on the other hand. the purpose of this section 11.6 is to grant to holders of the notes the same rights against the company with respect to the aggregate amount of such payments or distributions as the holders of senior indebtedness would have against the company if such aggregate amount were considered overdue senior indebtedness. 12. interpretation 12.1. definitions.

rights hereunder, in whole or in part, shall be registered on the books of the company to be maintained for such purpose, upon surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the company referred

issued. 3.2. division and combination. subject to section 9, this warrant may be divided into multiple warrants or combined with other warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office or

other distribution of, additional shares of common stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock into a larger number of shares of common stock, or (c) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, then (i) the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately after the occurrence of any such event shall be adjusted to equal the number of shares of common stock which a record holder of the same number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the occurrence of such event would own or be entitled to receive after the happening of such event, and (ii) the current warrant price per share shall be adjusted to equal (a) the current warrant price multiplied by the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the adjustment divided by (b) the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable immediately after such adjustment. 4.2. certain other distributions. if the company shall at any time or from time to time after may 1, 1997 declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution of: (a) cash, (b) any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever by way of dividend, including any distribution of

against the company, whether before or after the closing date, on the basis of events or circumstances occurring prior to the closing date ("pre-closing shareholder claims") (other than cash, convertible securities or additional shares of common stock), or (c) any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of its stock or any other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (other than cash, convertible securities or additional shares of common stock), then (i) the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted to equal the product of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share of common stock for the period of 20 trading days preceding such record and (b) the denominator of which shall be such current market price per share of common stock less the fair market value per share of common stock of any such dividend or distribution and (ii) the current warrant price shall be adjusted to equal (a) the current warrant price multiplied by the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the adjustment divided by (b) the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable immediately after such adjustment. a reclassification of the common stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value) into shares of common stock and shares of any other class of stock shall be deemed a distribution by the company to the holders of its common stock of such shares of such other class of stock within the meaning of this section 4.2 and, if the outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed into a larger or smaller number of shares of common stock as a part of such reclassification, such change shall be deemed a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the outstanding shares of common stock within the meaning of section 4.1. 4.3. issuance of additional shares of common stock. if at any time the company shall (except as hereinafter provided) issue or sell any additional shares of common stock, other than permitted issuances, in exchange for consideration in an amount per additional share of common stock less than the current warrant price at the time the additional shares of common stock are issued, then (i) the current warrant price as to the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable prior to such adjustment shall be reduced to a price determined by dividing (a) an amount equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale multiplied by the then existing current warrant price, plus (y) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issue or sale, by (b) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such issue or sale; and (ii) the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable shall be adjusted to equal the product obtained by multiplying the current warrant price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale by the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such issue or sale and dividing the product thereof by the current warrant price resulting from the adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) above. 4.4. issuance of warrants or other rights. if at any time the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution of, or shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell, any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon the exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities shall be less than the current warrant price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be adjusted as provided in section 4.3 on the basis that the maximum number of additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to all such warrants or other rights or necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding and the company shall have received all of the consideration payable therefor, if any, as of the date of the actual issuance of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and such warrants or other rights. no further adjustments of the current warrant price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock or of such convertible securities upon exercise of such warrants or other rights or upon the actual issue of such common stock upon such conversion or exchange of such convertible securities. notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment shall be required under this section 4.4 solely by reason of the issuance of stock purchase rights under a stockholder rights plan of the company, provided that the adjustments required by this section 4.4 shall be made if any "flip-in" or "flip-over" event shall occur under such stockholder rights plan. 4.5. issuance of convertible securities. if at any time the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution of, or shall in any manner (whether directly or by assumption in a merger in which the company is the surviving corporation) issue or sell, any convertible securities, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which common stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange shall be less than the current warrant price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale, then the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be adjusted as provided in section 4.3 on the basis that the maximum number of additional shares of common stock necessary to effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding and the company shall have received all of the consideration payable therefor, if any, as of the date of actual issuance of such convertible securities. no adjustment of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be made under this section 4.5 upon the issuance of any convertible securities which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights therefor, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights pursuant to section 4.4. no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be made upon the actual issue of such common stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities and, if any issue or sale of such convertible securities is made upon exercise of any warrant or other right to subscribe for or to purchase any such convertible securities for which adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price have been or are to be made pursuant to other provisions of this section 4, no further adjustments of the number of shares for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 4.6. superseding adjustment. if, at any time after any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall have been made pursuant to section 4.4 or section 4.5 as the result of any issuance of warrants, rights or convertible securities, (a) such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange in such other convertible securities, shall expire, and all or a portion of such warrants or rights, or the right of conversion or exchange with respect to all or a portion of such other convertible securities, as the case may be, shall not have been exercised, or (b) the consideration per share for which shares of common stock are issuable pursuant to such warrants or rights, or the terms of such other convertible securities, shall be increased solely by virtue of provisions therein contained for an automatic increase in such consideration per share upon the occurrence of a specified date or event, then for each outstanding warrant such previous adjustment shall be rescinded and annulled and the additional shares of common stock which were deemed to have been issued by virtue of the computation made in connection with the adjustment so rescinded and annulled shall no longer be deemed to have been issued by virtue of such computation. thereupon, a recomputation shall be made of the effect of such rights or options or other convertible securities on the basis of (c) treating the number of additional shares of common stock or other property, if any, theretofore actually issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of any such warrants or rights or any such right of conversion or exchange, as having been issued on the date or dates of any such exercise and for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor, and (d) treating any such warrants or rights or any such other convertible securities which then remain outstanding as having been granted or issued immediately after the time of such increase of the consideration per share for which shares of common stock or other property are issuable under such warrants or rights or other convertible securities; whereupon a new adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price shall be made, which new adjustment shall supersede the previous adjustment so rescinded and annulled. 4.7. other provisions applicable to adjustments under this section. the following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable and the current warrant price provided for in this section 4: (a) computation of consideration. to the extent that any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities shall be issued for cash consideration, the consideration received by the company therefor shall be the amount of the cash received by the company therefor, or, if such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are offered by the company for subscription, the subscription price, or, if such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities are sold to underwriters or dealers for public offering without a subscription offering, the initial public offering price (in any such case subtracting any amounts paid or receivable for accrued interest or accrued dividends and without taking into account any compensation, discounts or expenses paid or incurred by the company for and in the underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with, the issuance thereof). to the extent that such issuance shall be for a consideration other than cash, then, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the amount of such consideration shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such issuance. in case any additional shares of common stock or any convertible securities or any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued in connection with any merger in which the company issues any securities, the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving corporation as such board in good faith shall determine to be attributable to such additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or other rights, as the case may be. the consideration for any additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase the same shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing such warrants or other rights plus the additional consideration payable to the company upon exercise of such warrants or other rights. the consideration for any additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of any convertible securities shall be the consideration received by the company for issuing warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase such convertible securities, plus the consideration paid or payable to the company in respect of the subscription for or purchase of such convertible securities, plus the additional consideration, if any, payable to the company upon the exercise of the right of conversion or exchange in such convertible securities. in case of the issuance at any time of any additional shares of common stock or convertible securities in payment or satisfaction of any dividends upon any class of stock other than common stock, the company shall be deemed to have received for such additional shares of common stock or convertible securities a consideration equal to the amount of such dividend so paid or satisfied. if additional shares of common stock are sold as a unit with other securities or rights of value, the aggregate consideration received for such additional shares of common stock shall be deemed to be net of the fair market value of such other securities or rights of value. if additional shares of common stock or warrants, rights or convertible securities are issued in consideration for the release of pre-closing shareholder claims, the consideration for such additional shares of common stock or warrants, rights or convertible securities shall be deemed to be $0. (b) when adjustments to be made. the adjustments required by this section 4 shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring an adjustment shall occur, except that any adjustment of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable that would otherwise be required may be postponed (except in the case of a subdivision or combination of shares of the common stock, as provided for in section 4.1) up to, but not beyond the date of exercise if such adjustment either by itself or with other adjustments not previously made results in an increase or decrease of less than 1% of the shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the making of such adjustment. any adjustment representing a change of less than such minimum amount (except as aforesaid) which is postponed shall be carried forward and made as soon as such adjustment, together with other adjustments required by this section 4 and not previously made, would result in a minimum adjustment or on the date of exercise. for the purpose of any adjustment, any specified event shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its occurrence. (c) fractional interests. in computing adjustments under this section 4, fractional interests in common stock shall be taken into account to the nearest 1/100th of a share. (d) when adjustment not required. if the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase rights and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and annulled. (e) escrow of warrant stock. if, after any property becomes distributable pursuant to this section 4 by reason of the taking of any record of the holders of common stock, but prior to the occurrence of the event for which such record is taken, holder exercises this warrant, any additional shares of common stock issuable upon exercise by reason of such adjustment shall be deemed the last shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercised (notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein) and such shares or other property shall be held in escrow for holder by the company to be issued to holder when and to the extent that the event actually takes place, upon payment of the then current warrant price. notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary herein, if the event for which such record was taken fails to occur or is rescinded, then such escrowed shares shall be canceled by the company and escrowed property returned. (f) challenge to good faith determination. whenever the board of directors of the company shall be required to make a determination in good faith of the fair value of any item under this section 4, such determination may be challenged in good faith by the majority holders, and any dispute shall be resolved by an investment banking firm of recognized national standing selected by the company and acceptable to the majority holders. 4.8. reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets. in case the company shall reorganize its capital, reclassify its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another corporation (where the company is not the surviving corporation or where there is a change in or distribution with respect to the common stock of the company), or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its property, assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation, or any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation ("other property"), are to be received by or distributed to the holders of common stock of the company, then holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this warrant and payment of the warrant price, the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the company, if it is the surviving corporation, and other property receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a holder of the number of shares of common stock for which this warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event. in case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets, the successor or acquiring corporation (if other than the company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this warrant to be performed and observed by the company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed appropriate (as determined by resolution of the board of directors of the company) in order to provide for adjustments of shares of the common stock for which this warrant is exercisable which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 4. for purposes of this section 4.8, "common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation" shall include stock of such corporation of any class which is not preferred as to dividends or assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and which is not subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which are convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock. the foregoing provisions of this section 4.8 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of assets. 4.9. other action affecting common stock. in case at any time or from time to time the company shall take any action in respect of its common stock, other than any action described in this section 4, then the number of shares of common stock or other stock for which this warrant is exercisable and/or the purchase price thereof shall be adjusted in such manner as may be equitable in the circumstances. 4.10. certain limitations. notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the company agrees not to enter into any transaction which, by reason of any adjustment hereunder, would cause the current warrant price to be less than the par value per share of common stock. 5. notices to warrant holders 5.1. notice of adjustments; change in warrant status.

(b) priority in incidental registrations. if the managing underwriter of any underwritten offering shall inform the company by letter of its belief that the number or type of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration would materially adversely affect such offering, then the company will include in such registration, to the extent of the number and type which the company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering, (i) first, all securities proposed by the company to be sold for its own account or which the company is required to register on behalf of any third party exercising rights similar to those granted in section 2.1(a), (ii) second, such registrable securities and all other securities of the company requested to be included in such registration by third parties exercising rights similar to those granted in section 2.2(a) pro rata among such holders on the basis of the estimated gross proceeds of the securities of such holders requested to be so included, and (iii) third, any other securities of the company requested to be included in such registration. 2.3. registration on form s-3. if at any time after august 28, 1998, (a) any holder of registrable securities requests in writing that the company file a registration statement on form s-3 or any successor thereto for a public offering of all or any portion of the registrable securities held by such requesting holder and (b) the company is a registrant entitled to use form s-3 or any successor thereto, then, subject to section 2.9 hereof, the company shall use its best efforts to register under the securities act on form s-3 or any successor thereto, for public sale in accordance with the method of disposition specified in such request, including, without limitation, pursuant to rule 415 under the securities act, the registrable securities specified in such request. whenever the company is required by this section 2.3 to use its best efforts to effect the registration of registrable securities, each of the limitations, procedures and requirements of section 2.1(b), (e) and (f) (including but not limited to the requirement that the company notify all holders from whom a request has not been received and provide them with the opportunity to participate in the offering) shall apply to such registration. notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 2.3: (i) if the holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell registrable securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public (net of any underwriters' discounts or commissions) of less than $5,000,000; (ii) if the company has, within the twelve-month period preceding the date of such request, already effected two registrations on form s-3 on behalf of the holders; or (iii) in any jurisdiction in which the company would be required to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration qualification or compliance. 2.4. registration procedures.

provided, that the company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument executed by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter, as the case may be, specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof; and provided, further, that the company shall not be liable to any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of registrable securities or any other person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of such person's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of registrable securities to such person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus so long as such final prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, have been furnished to such underwriter. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director, officer, partner, agent or affiliate or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. (b) indemnification by the sellers. as a condition to including any registrable securities in any registration statement, the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from each holder joining in such registration, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section 2.8) the company, and each director of the company, each officer of the company and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company through an instrument duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that the liability of such indemnifying party under this section 2.8(b) shall be limited to the amount of proceeds received by such indemnifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.

(d) in the event that (i) any dividend payable on the series a preferred stock pursuant to section 2(a) shall not have been paid in full, (ii) the corporation shall have breached in any material respect any of the covenants (provided the applicable covenant shall then be in effect pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement (as defined in section 11)) set forth in the purchase agreement, (iii) the corporation shall have failed to redeem shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to section 5(a), whether or not by reason of the absence of legally available funds, or (iv), a cross-default or "fundamental change" within the meaning of paragraph (c) of section c8 of article iv of the certificate of incorporation shall occur, then, in any such case, the holders of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to annual dividends (in addition to any dividend payable pursuant to section 2(a)), at a rate of 11.75% per annum from the applicable quarterly dividend payment date or date of such breach, default or failure to redeem, as the case may be, through the date of payment of such dividend, cure of such breach or default or redemption, as the case may be. section 3. voting rights. in addition to any voting rights provided by law, the holders of shares of series a preferred stock shall have the following voting rights: (a) so long as any of the series a preferred stock is outstanding, each share of series a preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the corporation, voting together as a single class with the holders of common stock. the holders of each share of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to vote with respect to each share of series a preferred stock held by each such holder a number of votes equal to the number of votes which could be cast in such vote by a holder of the number of shares of common stock into which such share of series a preferred stock is convertible (as adjusted pursuant to section 8) on the record date for such vote.

(ii) the company shall have the right, at its sole option and election made in accordance with clause (c) below, to redeem the series a preferred stock, on or after the date 18 months after the closing date (as defined in the purchase agreement) in whole but not in part, if the current market price per share of the common stock shall exceed the conversion price multiplied by 350% for at least 90 consecutive trading days, at a redemption price, subject to the final paragraphs of this clause (ii), equal to the redemption price. in the event that at any time a change of control has occurred prior to a redemption pursuant to this section 5(a)(ii), the redemption price of each share of preferred stock until the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in clause (d) of this section 5 shall equal the change of control price (as defined in clause (b) below).

(a) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of series a preferred stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder at any time after the issue date into shares of common stock at the conversion ratio (as defined in section 11). (b) any conversion by the holders of the series a preferred stock shall be in an aggregate amount with a stated value equal to at least $100,000 or all shares of series a preferred stock of such holder. conversion of the series a preferred stock may be effected by any such holder upon the surrender to the corporation at the principal office of the corporation in the state of california or at the office of any agent or agents of the corporation, as may be designated by the board of directors of the corporation (the "transfer agent"), of the certificate(s) for such series a preferred stock to be converted, accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified whole number of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this section 8 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of common stock to be issued. in case any holder's notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of common stock in such name or names. other than such taxes, the corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of common stock on conversion of series a preferred stock pursuant hereto. as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the corporation that such taxes have been paid), the corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of common stock, to which the holder of shares of series a preferred stock being converted shall be entitled and (ii) if less than the full number of shares of series a preferred stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares being converted. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of giving such notice so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of common stock, in accordance herewith, and the person entitled to receive the shares of common stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of common stock at such time, so long as certificates for such holder's shares of series a preferred stock are delivered to the corporation within two business days after the giving of notice. in any other case of conversion at the holder's option, the date of delivery of the certificates for the shares of series a preferred stock shall be deemed to be the date of conversion. in case any shares of series a preferred stock are to be redeemed pursuant to section 5, such right of conversion shall cease and terminate as to the shares of series a preferred stock to be redeemed at the close of business on the business day preceding the date fixed for redemption unless the corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption price or the change of control price, as the case may be. (c) the conversion ratio shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in certain instances as hereinafter provided. (d) in connection with the conversion of any shares of series a preferred stock into common stock, no fractions of shares of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the current market price per share of common stock on the trading day on which such shares of series a preferred stock are deemed to have been converted. if more than one share of series a preferred stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of common stock issuable on conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of series a preferred stock so surrendered. promptly upon conversion, the corporation shall pay to the holder of shares of series a preferred stock so converted out of funds legally available, an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of series a preferred stock surrendered for conversion to the date of such conversion, together with cash in lieu of any fractional interest of such holder. (e) (i) the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock, free from any preemptive rights such number of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock into common stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock. (ii) upon conversion of shares of series a preferred stock as contemplated by this section 8, the corporation shall issue together with each such share of common stock one right (or other securities in lieu thereof), or any rights issued to holders of common stock of the corporation in addition thereto or in replacement therefor, whether or not such rights shall be exercisable at such time, but only if such rights are issued and outstanding and held by other holders of common stock of the corporation at such time and have not expired. (f) the conversion ratio will be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (i) in case the corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the issue date (a) pay a dividend, or make a distribution, on the outstanding shares of common stock in shares of common stock, (b) subdivide the outstanding shares of common stock, (c) combine the outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares or (d) issue by reclassification of the shares of common stock any shares of capital stock of the corporation, then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio in effect immediately prior to such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any shares of series a preferred stock thereafter surrendered for conversion into common stock shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock or other securities of the corporation which such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such shares of series a preferred stock been surrendered for conversion immediately prior to the happening of such event or the record date therefor, whichever is earlier. an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective (x) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of common stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (y) in the case of such subdivision, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this clause (i) in connection with any transaction to which paragraph (g) applies. (ii) in case the corporation shall issue shares of common stock (or rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) after the issue date at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the conversion price as of the date of issuance of such shares (or, in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities, less than the conversion price as of the date of issuance of the rights, warrants or other securities in respect of which shares of common stock were issued), then, and in each such case, the conversion ratio and the conversion price shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of series a preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, upon the conversion thereof into common stock, the number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying (a) the conversion ratio in effect on the day immediately prior to such date by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (2) the number of additional shares of common stock issued (or into which the convertible securities may convert), and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date and (y) the number of shares of common stock purchasable at the then applicable conversion price per share with the aggregate consideration receivable by the corporation for the total number of shares of common stock so issued (or into which the rights, warrants or other convertible securities may convert). an adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be made on the next business day following the date on which any such issuance is made and shall be effective retroactively to the close of business

designated by the purchaser is a member or (d) any option, warrant, right, or convertible security outstanding as of may 1, 1997 (other than the rights or similar securities) shall not be deemed to

convertible securities for which an adjustment has been made pursuant to this clause (ii), the adjustments shall forthwith be reversed to effect such rate of conversion as would have been in effect at

(iv) for purposes of this paragraph (f), the number of shares of common stock at any time outstanding shall not include any shares of common stock then owned or held by or for the account of the corporation as well as any settlement of shareholder litigation.

(viii) if the corporation shall take a record of the holders of its common stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the right of conversion granted by this paragraph (f) or in the conversion ratio or conversion price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record. (ix) if any event occurs as to which the provisions of this section 8(f) are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, the board of directors shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such rights of the holders of the series a preferred stock. (x) in the case of any event which requires an adjustment to the conversion ratio pursuant to this section 8(f), the conversion price shall also be appropriately adjusted to reflect such event.
