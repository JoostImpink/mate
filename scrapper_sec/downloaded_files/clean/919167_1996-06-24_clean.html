("bugaboo") announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") with longhorn steaks, inc. ("longhorn") and whip merger corporation ("merger corp."), a wholly-owned subsidiary of longhorn. the merger agreement provides that, at the "effective time" (as defined in the merger agreement), merger corp. shall be merged with and into bugaboo (the "merger"). merger corp. will then cease to exist and bugaboo will continue as the surviving corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of - 3 - longhorn. by virtue of the merger, each share of bugaboo common stock ("bugaboo common stock") outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock of longhorn ("longhorn common stock"). the exchange ratio for purposes of determining the number of shares of longhorn common stock to be received by bugaboo shareholders for each share of bugaboo common stock owned shall be equal to $10.25 divided by the base period trading price of longhorn common stock. the base period trading price is defined as the average of the daily last sales prices for shares of longhorn common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the closing date (as defined in the merger agreement), provided that the base period trading price shall not exceed $27.25 nor be less than $24.00. accordingly, shareholders of bugaboo common stock will receive a minimum of 0.376 and a maximum of 0.427 shares of longhorn common stock per share of bugaboo common stock. longhorn common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market's national market under the symbol "loho". the closing sale price of longhorn common stock on the nasdaq national market on june 17, 1996 was $22.765. it is anticipated that the merger will be tax-free to the bugaboo shareholders and will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. in order to obtain pooling-of-interest treatment, longhorn will also acquire three non-bugaboo restaurants which are owned by mr. grace alone or jointly by mr. grace and mr. orr, a director of bugaboo -- hemenway's sea food in providence, rhode island, old grist mill tavern in seekonk, massachusetts, and monterey restaurant in warwick, rhode island. in addition, longhorn will acquire the limited liability company owned by bugaboo directors grace, orr and snowden which holds title to the site of the bugaboo creek restaurant located in springfield, virginia, and will acquire from messrs. grace and orr real property located in seekonk, massachusetts, which is leased to old grist mill tavern. longhorn will acquire the three restaurants and related real estate for approximately $3,825,000 payable in longhorn common stock (valued at the base period trading price) and the assumption of approximately $1,575,000 of existing debt. the merger agreement is subject to termination by either bugaboo or longhorn if the last sale price of longhorn common stock is less than $21.00 per share for five consecutive trading days prior to the effective time. the merger agreement may also be terminated by longhorn under certain conditions if bugaboo, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and in accordance with the fiduciary duties of bugaboo's board of directors, considers an alternative acquisition proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) and by bugaboo if the bugaboo board of directors determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, to recommend to bugaboo's shareholders an alternative acquisition proposal. if the merger agreement is terminated as a result of bugaboo's consideration and/or recommendation of an alternative acquisition proposal, bugaboo must pay the out-of-pocket expenses of longhorn incurred in connection with the merger agreement up to a maximum of $750,000. in addition, if within 10 months following such termination bugaboo has entered into a business combination (as defined in the merger agreement), the third party to such business - 4 - combination must pay to longhorn the amount of $2,000,000 less any expenses previously paid by bugaboo to longhorn. the merger is subject to various conditions customary to transactions of this type, including the approvals of the shareholders of bugaboo and longhorn, the receipt of liquor license and other governmental permit approvals, expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, and the consent of bugaboo's lenders. subject to these matters, it is anticipated that the merger will be consummated in late september 1996. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer.

(a) each share of lsi capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the effective time. (b) each share of sub common stock issued and outstanding at the effective time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into one share of bcs common stock. (c) each share of bcs common stock excluding shares held by any bcs company or any lsi company issued and outstanding at the effective time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive that multiple of a share of lsi common stock (the "exchange ratio") obtained by dividing $10.250 (the "per share purchase price") by the base period trading price (defined to mean the average of the daily last sale prices for the shares of lsi common stock for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days on which such shares are actually traded as over-the-counter securities and quoted on the nasdaq national market (as reported by the wall street journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) ending at the close of trading on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the closing date) and rounded to the third decimal place; provided, that for purposes of this calculation, the base period trading price shall be deemed to equal (i) $27.250 in the event the base period trading price is greater than $27.250 or (ii) $24.000 in the event the base period trading price is less than $24.000 (collectively, $27.250 and $24.000 are referred to as the "base period trading price limitations"). 3.2 anti-dilution provisions. in the event lsi changes the number of shares of lsi common stock issued and outstanding prior to the effective time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior to the effective time, (i) the base period trading price limitations shall be adjusted to appropriately adjust the ratio under which shares of bcs common stock will be converted into shares of lsi common stock pursuant to section 3.1(c) of this agreement, (ii) the minimum trading price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change in the number of shares of lsi common stock outstanding, and (iii) if necessary, the anticipated effective time shall be postponed for an appropriate period of time agreed upon by the parties in order for the base period trading price to reflect the market effect of such stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization. 3.3 shares held by bcs or lsi. each of the shares of bcs common stock held by any bcs company or by any lsi company shall be canceled and retired at the effective time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 3.4 fractional shares. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, each holder of shares of bcs common stock exchanged pursuant to the merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of lsi common stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of lsi common stock multiplied by the market value of one share of lsi common stock at the effective time. the market value of one share of lsi common stock at the effective time shall be the last sale price of lsi common stock on the nasdaq national market (as reported by the wall street journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the last trading day preceding the effective time. no such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares. 3.5 conversion of stock options. (a) at the effective time, each option or other right to purchase shares of bcs common stock pursuant to stock options or stock appreciation rights ("bcs options") granted by bcs under the bcs stock plans, which are outstanding at the effective time, whether or not exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to lsi common stock, and lsi shall assume each bcs option, in accordance with the terms of the bcs stock plan and stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the effective time, (i) lsi and its stock option committee shall be substituted for bcs and the committee of bcs's board of directors (including, if applicable, the entire board of directors of bcs) administering such bcs stock plan, (ii) each bcs option assumed by lsi may be exercised solely for shares of lsi common stock (or cash in the case of stock appreciation rights), (iii) the number of shares of lsi common stock subject to such bcs option shall be equal to the number of shares of bcs common stock subject to such bcs option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by the exchange ratio, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such bcs option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such bcs option by the exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. notwithstanding the provisions of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, lsi shall not be obligated to issue any fraction of a share of lsi common stock upon exercise of bcs options and any fraction of a share of lsi common stock that otherwise would be subject to a converted bcs option shall represent the right to receive a cash payment upon exercise of such converted bcs option equal to the product of such fraction and the difference between the market value of one share of lsi common stock at the time of exercise of such option and the per share exercise price of such option. the market value of one share of lsi common stock at the time of exercise of an option shall be the last sale price of the lsi common stock on the nasdaq national market (as reported by the wall street journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the last trading day preceding the date of exercise. in addition, notwithstanding the clauses (iii) and (iv) of the first sentence of this section 3.5, each bcs option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by section 424 of the internal revenue code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option, within the meaning of section 424(h) of the internal revenue code. bcs agrees to take all necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this section 3.5, including using its reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of a bcs option any consent or contract that may be deemed necessary or advisable in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this section 3.5. (b) as soon as practicable after the effective time, lsi shall deliver to the participants in each bcs stock plan an appropriate notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto and the grants subject to such bcs stock plan shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by section 3.5(a) after giving effect to the merger), and lsi shall
