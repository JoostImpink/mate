(iii) purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless parent and each underwriter, within the meaning of the act, who may purchase from or sell for sellers any purchaser common stock, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under the act or any post-effective amendment to such registration statement, or any prospectus included therein required to be filed or furnished by reason of this section 11.2 or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission based upon information furnished or required to be furnished in writing to purchaser by sellers or such underwriter expressly for use therein, which indemnification shall include each person, if any, who controls any seller or any such underwriter within the meaning of the act and each officer, director, employee and agent of parent or such underwriter; provided, however, that purchaser shall not be obliged so to indemnify any seller or underwriter or other person referred to above unless such seller or underwriter or other person, as the case may be, shall at the same time indemnify purchaser, its directors, each officer signing the registration statement and each person, if any, who controls purchaser within the meaning of the act, from and against 74 any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or any prospectus required to be filed or furnished by reason of this section 11.2 or caused by any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to purchaser by any seller or underwriter expressly for use therein.
