("ctfg") and those certain persons listed on schedule 7(b) hereof (the "taylor family") and represented by the members of the taylor family shown on the signature page hereof, for the purposes described below. recitals whereas, ctfg is the beneficial and record owner of one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the "bank stock") of cole taylor bank, an illinois state-chartered bank, having its principal place of business at 350 east dundee road, wheeling, illinois 60090 (the "bank"); and whereas, substantial disagreements have arisen between ctfg's two largest shareholder groups concerning the future strategic direction of ctfg and, in an effort to avoid the adverse consequences of these disagreements, the taylor family has offered to exchange its shares in ctfg for shares of the bank; whereas, the board of directors of ctfg (the "board") has determined that the transfer of all of the outstanding shares of bank stock and certain other assets of ctfg in exchange for certain shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of ctfg (the "ctfg stock") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement are fair to and in the best interest of ctfg and its shareholders; and whereas, the parties desire to enter into certain other related agreements in connection with the foregoing transactions; and whereas, the taylor family currently intends to cause a new bank holding company ("newco") to be formed to hold the bank stock at the closing (as defined below) if permitted by the private letter ruling (as defined below); and whereas, the parties hereto intend that the exchange of the bank stock (or newco stock as the case may be) for ctfg stock owned by the taylor family, as described herein, qualify as a tax-free split-off under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereby agree as follows: 1. exchange of bank stock. upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, ctfg shall assign, transfer and deliver to the taylor family (or, with respect to not more than 49.9% of the outstanding stock of the bank, to such party or parties as the taylor family shall direct) on the closing date (as hereinafter defined), in exchange for a number of shares of ctfg stock equal to the stock amount (as defined below), all right, title and interest in and to all of the bank stock. in the event that the private letter ruling specifically contemplates the formation of newco and the transfer of bank stock to it and such transfer occurs prior to the closing, ctfg shall exchange and the taylor family (or, with respect to not more than 49.9% of the outstanding stock of newco, such party or parties as the taylor family shall direct) shall receive newco stock in lieu of bank stock. 2. exchange of ctfg stock; options; adjustments. 2.1 transfer and exchange. at the closing, in exchange for the transfer of the bank stock or newco stock to the taylor family (or, with respect to not more than 49.9% of the outstanding stock of the bank or newco, to such party or parties as the taylor family shall direct), the taylor family shall assign, transfer and deliver or cause to be assigned, transferred and delivered to ctfg a number of shares of ctfg stock to be determined, subject to the proviso set forth below, at the discretion of the taylor family (such number of shares of ctfg stock shall be referred to as the "stock amount"); provided, however, that in no event shall the stock amount consist of more than 4,500,000 shares of ctfg common stock or less than the greater of (i) 4,000,000 shares of ctfg common stock or (ii) all of the shares of ctfg stock owned beneficially or of record by the taylor family (including any shares of ctfg stock owned after the exercise of any options to purchase shares of ctfg stock ("options") and any shares of ctfg stock in the ctfg employee stock ownership plan (the "esop") and the ctfg 401(k) plan allocated to members of the taylor family) immediately prior to the closing. 2.2 options. ctfg will cause all outstanding options to become vested and exercisable prior to the closing. each taylor family member holding any options shall exercise such options at or prior to the closing. 2.3 change in ctfg stock. in the event that between the date of this agreement and the closing date ctfg subdivides the outstanding shares of ctfg stock into a greater number of shares, or combines its outstanding shares of ctfg stock into a smaller number of shares, or effects a reclassification of the ctfg stock, or pays a dividend in shares of its capital stock, then the consideration set forth in this section 2 shall be adjusted so that the number of shares of ctfg stock to be received by ctfg shall be reduced or increased by an amount such that the aggregate value received is not increased or decreased as a result of such subdivision, combination, reclassification or dividend. 3. pre-closing transactions. 3.1 spin-off of automobile receivables business. prior to the closing, ctfg shall cause the bank to form a new wholly-owned subsidiary ("auto sub") to which the bank shall contribute its used automobile receivables business, consisting of substantially all of the assets used in its used automobile receivables business (the "uarb assets") and (i) the cash component (as defined below); plus (ii) all of the bank's rights and obligations pursuant to automobile loans, notes or the bank's securities which as of the closing date are collateralized primarily with used automobiles and have a fair market value as determined in writing by kpmg peat marwick (or such other person upon whom the parties hereto shall mutually agree) of no less than $30,000,000 nor more than $31,000,000 (the "automobile receivables"). immediately prior to the closing, ctfg shall cause the bank employees identified on schedule 3.1 to be terminated by the bank and immediately offered employment with auto sub. the bank shall be responsible for and shall indemnify ctfg for severance costs arising out of such termination. the term "cash component" shall mean: (x) if the stock amount is less than 4,250,000, cash in an amount equal to (a) $60,000,000 minus (b) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the automobile receivables exceeds $30,000,000 plus (c) the product of $33.00 and the difference between 4,250,000 and the stock amount; (y) if the stock amount is equal to 4,250,000, cash in an amount equal to (a) $60,000,000 minus (b) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the automobile receivables exceeds $30,000,000; and (z) if the stock amount is greater than 4,250,000, cash in an amount equal to (a) $60,000,000 minus (b) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the automobile receivables exceeds $30,000,000 minus (c) the product of $33.00 and the difference between the stock amount and 4,250,000. 3.2 transfer to ctfg. immediately prior to the closing date, ctfg shall cause the bank to distribute all of the capital stock of auto sub to ctfg, following which ctfg shall cause cole taylor finance co., a delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ctfg ("finance") to be merged with and into auto sub. 3.3 investment in alpha capital fund ii, l.p. the taylor family shall cause the bank or newco to purchase at closing all of ctfg,s rights, obligations and interest, including, without limitation, ctfg's $500,000 commitment with respect thereto (the "alpha interest") in alpha capital fund ii, l.p., a small business investment company ("alpha capital fund"), for cash in an amount equal to ctfg's cash investment in alpha capital fund, net of all partner distributions, return of capital and like payments, made from time to time prior to the date hereof (which was $139,831 as of may 31, 1996), plus any additional cash investment made by ctfg in alpha capital fund after the date hereof if made with the taylor family's consent, plus interest on the total amount invested beginning, as to each portion of such amount invested at different times, on the date of such investment, at the rate of 9% per annum, compounded annually. 3.4 sale of ct mortgage company, inc. prior to or at closing, ctfg shall sell and the bank or, at the option of the taylor family, newco, shall purchase, 100% of the capital stock (the "ct mortgage stock") of ct mortgage company, inc.

transfer of bank stock. if specifically contemplated by the private letter ruling and requested by the taylor family, prior to the closing ctfg shall form newco and shall transfer all the bank shares owned by ctfg to newco. ctfg shall not, however, be required to effectuate this transfer unless (1) the taylor family shall have applied for and obtained appropriate regulatory approval for newco, (2) the internal revenue service shall have ruled in the private letter ruling that the transfer of bank stock by ctfg to newco is a taxfree transaction to ctfg and newco, and (3) the new bank securities (as defined below) shall be issued on terms disclosed to the internal revenue service and consistent with the private letter ruling. 4. consummation of the transactions;

(ii) ctfg and the taylor family shall cooperate in the preparation of the proxy statement. the proxy statement shall not, at the time filed with the sec, at the time mailed to the company's shareholders, at the time of the shareholders meeting or at the closing date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(ii) for the two-year period following the closing date, unless the taylor family has obtained a written opinion from nationally recognized tax counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to tax counsel for ctfg, that the desired transactions and any transaction related thereto will neither affect the qualification of the exchange of the bank stock (or the newco stock, as the case may be) for the ctfg stock under section 355 of the code nor affect the validity of the private letter ruling (a "tax opinion"), (x) no taylor family member will sell, exchange, transfer or enter into any transaction reducing economic risk with respect to, the bank stock received in the split-off, (y) the taylor family will cause the bank to continue the active conduct of its banking business, and (z) the taylor family will not permit either the bank or newco (if newco is formed) to (a) merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, (b) liquidate or partially liquidate, (c) sell or transfer any significant part of its assets, (d) redeem or otherwise purchase any of its capital stock, or (e) except as specifically contemplated by the private letter ruling, issue additional shares of its capital stock; provided, however, that, regardless of whether the taylor family has obtained a tax opinion, the taylor family shall not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding for transfer of control of the bank or newco (a "transfer arrangement") for one year following the closing date and, if the taylor family enters into a transfer arrangement more than one year but less than two years following the closing date, the taylor family shall remain responsible for ensuring that, and shall obtain a written contractual commitment from the other parties to the transfer arrangement that they will ensure that, the bank and newco comply with this section 10(g)(ii) except to the extent that the tax opinion also opines that the qualification of the exchange of the bank stock (or the newco stock, as the case may be) for the ctfg stock under section 355 and the validity of the private letter ruling will not be affected by the particular actions specified in the tax opinion. (iii) for the two-year period following the closing date, unless ctfg has obtained a written opinion from nationally recognized tax counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to tax counsel for the taylor family, that the desired transactions and any transaction related thereto will neither affect the qualification of the exchange of the bank stock (or the newco stock, as the case may be) for the ctfg stock under section 355 of the code nor affect the validity of the private letter ruling, (x) ctfg will not sell, exchange or transfer the capital stock of auto sub, (y) ctfg will not permit auto sub to (a) merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation (other than a merger of finance with and into auto sub), (b) liquidate or partially liquidate, or (c) sell or transfer any significant part of the uarb assets and (z) ctfg will not redeem or repurchase any shares of ctfg stock (except for purchases of up to 16 percent of the outstanding ctfg stock as described in schedule 10(e) or such greater amounts as may be consistent with the private letter ruling).

(v) each of the bank and/or newco and ctfg shall deliver a certificate of an officer as to compliance with such covenants to the other on the last day of each calendar quarter until such ongoing covenants have terminated.

(a) if this agreement is terminated pursuant to section 13(h), or pursuant to section 13(i) under circumstances where the actions of ctfg or the board which triggered the right of the taylor family to terminate this agreement pursuant to section 13(i) were permitted by section 9(c) and not otherwise a breach of this agreement, ctfg shall immediately pay the taylor family as an exclusive remedy liquidated damages in an amount equal to (i) its out of pocket expenses paid to lawyers, accountants, investment bankers or other experts plus (ii) three percent of the fair market value (determined as of the date this agreement is terminated) of the acquisition proposal that gave rise to the termination of this agreement. (b) if this agreement is terminated by the taylor family pursuant to section 13(d), ctfg shall immediately pay the taylor family as an exclusive remedy liquidated damages equal to $15 million. (c) if this agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) section 13(c) other than because of a failure to obtain the approval of the applicable governmental authorities resulting from a failure to comply with the community reinvestment act or fair lending statutes, (ii) pursuant to section 13(f) where the failure to have closed before the applicable date was caused by (x) a failure to have obtained the private letter ruling, (y) a failure to obtain the financing required by section 5.2, or (z) the failure to have obtained the approval of the applicable governmental authorities for any reason other than a failure to comply with the community reinvestment act or fair lending statutes or (iii) pursuant to section 13(g) (a termination pursuant to (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section 14(c) being a "triggering termination"), then ctfg will be entitled, subject to adjustment pursuant to, and in the manner provided by, section 14(d), to receive from the taylor family, as an exclusive remedy, liquidated damages in an amount equal to $15 million. (d) if this agreement is terminated as a result of a triggering termination, ctfg agrees to immediately use its reasonable best efforts to solicit bids from third parties for the sale of all of the equity interest in the bank (the "bank sale process"). the taylor family shall use its reasonable best efforts to support the bank sale process. if members of the taylor family are members of the board, those board members shall direct the bank sale process, which power of direction shall include the right to choose an investment banker to represent ctfg (with such investment banker to be retained and compensated by ctfg on customary terms) in connection with the bank sale process. the nominating committee of the board shall restate any taylor director for reelection as a director of ctfg if his present term will expire before the end of the bank sale process. if, during the nine month period after a triggering termination, ctfg receives a sufficient bona fide offer to acquire all of the equity interest in the bank that the taylor family wishes the board to consider, the obligation of the taylor family to pay ctfg $15 million pursuant to section 14(c) shall be reduced (provided that in no event shall such obligation ever be less than zero) by the amount by which the sufficient bona fide offer would provide ctfg with gross proceeds with a fair market value in excess of $235 million, and ctfg shall be entitled to receive the amount payable under section 14(c), as reduced pursuant to this sentence. the board shall be under no obligation to accept a sufficient bona fide offer that the taylor family wishes the board to consider; provided, however, that should the board decide to reject a sufficient bona fide offer, the obligation of the taylor family to pay ctfg $15 million shall nonetheless be reduced as provided for in the preceding sentence. if no sufficient bona fide offer that the taylor family wishes the board to consider has been made during the nine months after a triggering termination, the full $15 million payable under section 14(c) shall be payable to ctfg. a "sufficient bona fide offer" shall be an offer for all of the equity interest in the bank from a financially reliable third party (or parties) and subject only to customary terms and conditions that, if accepted, would be likely to be consummated and that, if consummated, would provide ctfg with gross proceeds with a fair market value in excess of $235 million. notwithstanding the foregoing, the board, without the participation of any member of the taylor family, may resolve not to pursue the bank sale process, to terminate the bank sale process (with or without an agreement to sell all of the equity interest in the bank) or to enter into an agreement providing for the merger or disposition of the stock or assets of ctfg prior to the expiration of the nine month period following a triggering termination, in which case the obligation of the taylor family to pay ctfg $15 million pursuant to section 14(c) shall be extinguished. any amounts payable under section 14(c) or this section 14(d) may be paid, at the option of the taylor family, in cash, in ctfg stock valued at the market value as of the date of such payment, or in a combination of cash and ctfg stock valued at the market value (as defined below) as of the date of such payment and shall be paid within seven days from the expiration of the taylor sale period. should any such amounts not be paid by the taylor family within such seven days, the amount shall be paid from the escrow fund to the extent the escrow fund is sufficient for this purpose and immediately by the taylor family directly to the extent the escrow fund is insufficient for this purpose. should the taylor family pay such liquidated damages from another source, ctfg agrees to issue joint written instructions with the taylor family to effectuate the release of the escrow fund to the taylor family. the term "market value" on any date shall mean the average of the last quoted trading price of ctfg stock on the nasdaq stock market for the five preceding nasdaq stock market trading days. the "taylor sale period" shall be the shorter of (i) the nine month period after a triggering termination, (ii) the period beginning with a triggering termination and ending with a decision by the board to not pursue or to terminate the bank sale process or (iii) the period beginning with a triggering termination and ending on the date the taylor directors present a sufficient bona fide offer to the board. (e) in the event of the termination of this agreement pursuant to section 13, this agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, other than as provided in this section 14, in the second to last sentence of section 5.2, in section 9 (provided that, in the absence of a triggering termination, section 9 shall become void and have no effect upon the termination of this agreement), in section 17 and in section 24. no termination of this agreement and nothing contained in this section 14(e) shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this agreement except insofar as liquidated damages are paid by any party pursuant to sections 14(a), 14(b) or 14(c). the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages specified in section 14(a), 14(b) and 14(c) are not a penalty, and are reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm, the difficulty of proof of loss, and the inconvenience and nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. 15. indemnification. (a) the taylor family shall indemnify and hold harmless ctfg and its affiliates from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities or obligations (including attorneys fees and interest) ("losses") with respect to (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement of the taylor family contained in this agreement and (ii) any brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees payable on the basis of any action taken or caused to be taken by the taylor family. after the closing, the taylor family shall cause the bank to indemnify and hold harmless ctfg and its affiliates from and against any and all losses (x) whenever incurred, arising or accrued, relating to the bank or ct mortgage or ctfg's ownership of securities in the bank, ct mortgage or alpha capital fund or (y) incurred, arising or accrued prior to the closing and relating to auto sub. in addition, after the closing, the taylor family shall indemnify and hold harmless ctfg from and against 25% of any losses, including, without limitation, any costs or expenses of defense or settlement of any suits, actions or proceedings initiated by third parties and any judgments in such suits, actions or proceedings relating to the transactions contemplated by this agreement and any losses relating to disputes regarding option terminations or limitations (collectively, "transaction challenge losses"); provided, however, that transaction challenge losses shall be net of any insurance proceeds paid to, or for the benefit of, ctfg or members of the board, and provided, further, that, for purposes of computing what the taylor family owes under this sentence, any attorneys fees or expenses, settlements or judgments paid separately by the taylor family in connection with suits, actions or proceedings relating to the transactions contemplated by this agreement or regarding option limitations or terminations (net of any insurance proceeds paid to, or for the benefit of, the taylor family) shall (a) be considered part of transaction challenge losses and (b) constitute a credit against any amounts that the taylor family owes under this sentence (with such credit not to exceed such amounts that the taylor family owes under this sentence). (b) ctfg shall indemnify and hold harmless the taylor family, its affiliates, and the bank from and against any and all losses with respect to (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement of ctfg contained in this agreement and (ii) any brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees payable on the basis of any action taken or caused to be taken by ctfg. in addition, after the closing, ctfg shall indemnify and hold harmless the taylor family from and against any and all losses (x) whenever incurred, arising or accrued, relating to ctfg (except for matters for which the taylor family is indemnifying ctfg pursuant to this agreement) or finance or (y) incurred, arising or accrued after the closing and relating to auto sub. (c) as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a claim for indemnification under this agreement, the person claiming a right to indemnification (the "indemnified person") shall promptly give notice to the person from whom indemnification is being sought (the "indemnifying person") of such claim and the amount of indemnification claimed hereunder; provided that the failure of the indemnified person to give notice shall not relieve the indemnifying person of its obligations under this agreement except to the extent (if any) that the indemnifying person shall have been prejudiced thereby. (d) with respect to claims for indemnification arising out of a claim, or the commencement of any suit action or proceeding asserted by a person not a party to this agreement, the indemnifying person may, at its own expense (i) participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (ii) upon notice to the indemnified person and the indemnifying person's delivering to the indemnified person a written agreement that the indemnified person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this section 15 for all losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding, at
