television broadcaster, (iii) canal+'s french premium pay television channel was retained by canal+ and (iv) vivendi universal combined, through its subsidiaries, with seagram in accordance with the arrangement. at the effective time of the arrangement, seagram shareholders received 0.8 of an ads for each seagram common share held by them, except for those seagram common shares held by dissenting shareholders or canadian resident seagram shareholders that validly elected to receive 0.8 of an exchangeable share and 0.8 of a vivendi universal voting right for each seagram common share held by them. each ads represents one ordinary share. each exchangeable share is substantially the economic equivalent of one ads and, prior to its redemption date, is exchangeable by its holder at any time for one ads. the exchangeable shares may be redeemed by exchangeco in exchange for consideration per exchangeable share consisting of one ads and an amount in cash equal to the declared and unpaid dividends on one exchangeable share. the exchangeable shares cannot be redeemed earlier than the thirtieth anniversary of the date that is fourteen days before the effective date, unless certain events shall have occurred. each of the vivendi universal voting rights entitle the holder to one vote on the same basis and in the same circumstances as one ordinary share. in the merger transactions, each vivendi ordinary share was exchanged for one ordinary share. holders of canal+ ordinary shares received two ordinary shares for each canal+ ordinary share they held and retained their existing ordinary shares of canal+. the preceding summary of the merger transactions is not intended to be complete and is qualified by reference to (i) the merger agreement dated as of june 19,

or - requesting that vivendi universal or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents amend or waive the governance agreement or the organizational documents of vivendi universal or any of its affiliates. under the governance agreement, the shareholder parties are deemed to act in concert with respect to the arrangements contemplated by the governance agreement and matters related to vivendi universal upon which the shareholder parties are entitled to vote. effectiveness and termination the governance agreement provides that the rights and obligations of the shareholder parties and their permitted transferees generally will terminate upon the earlier of: - the 30th anniversary of the completion of the arrangement; and - the date on which the shareholder parties are no longer entitled to designate any members of the vivendi universal board, except that the transfer restrictions and standstill provisions will automatically be reinstated if, within 12 months of such termination, the shareholder parties acquire beneficial ownership of a number of vivendi universal voting securities that would have entitled the shareholder parties to designate at least one member of the vivendi universal board. the rights and obligations of the shareholder parties under the transfer restrictions and standstill provisions of the governance agreement will terminate immediately if: - any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than one-third of the vivendi universal voting securities;
