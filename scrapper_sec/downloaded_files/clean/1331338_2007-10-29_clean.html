conditions thereof, mergersub will merge with and into the issuer (the &#147;merger&#148;), with the issuer continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of holdings. if the

by it) as sole lead bookrunner and sole lead arranger, and (ii) $165 million in either (a) gross proceeds from the issuance and sale by holdings of unsecured senior subordinated debt securities (the &#147;senior subordinated notes&#148;) or (b) borrowings under a senior subordinated unsecured credit facility from wachovia investments (the &#147;bridge facility&#148;). wachovia securities will act as bookrunning manager, underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for (x) the senior subordinated notes or (y) if the bridge facility is funded upon consummation of the merger, the issuance or sale of any debt securities for the purpose of refinancing all or a portion of the outstanding amounts under the bridge facility. funding of the senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes or the bridge facility remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a summary of which is included in appendix a within exhibit 99.3 attached hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. 11 pursuant to that certain equity commitment letter from vestar to holdings dated as of october 19, 2007 and attached hereto as exhibit 99.4 (the &#147;equity commitment letters&#148;), vestar has agreed to make capital contributions of up to $560,000,000 to holdings in exchange for equity of rti in order to enable holdings and merger sub to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. these contributions are subject to (i) vestar determining that all of the conditions to the obligations of holdings and mergersub under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived and (ii) the concurrent consummation of the merger. as of the date of this statement, the acquiring entities have not paid any funds or other consideration for purchases of common stock. the descriptions of the merger agreement, the bank commitment letter and the equity commitment letter do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text thereof, copies of which are filed as exhibits 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. the information set forth in item 4 of this schedule 13d is hereby incorporated herein by reference. item 4. purpose of transaction the merger agreement provides that each issued and outstanding share of common stock (other than those held by the issuer, any subsidiary of the issuer or by rti or mergersub, which will be cancelled, and other than the shares held by shareholders who have exercised their statutory appraisal rights under the laws of the state of florida) will be treated in the merger as follows: (a) except as otherwise provided in clause (b) below, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $32.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the &#147;merger consideration&#148;); and (b) certain shares of common stock owned by the management holders will be contributed to rti immediately prior to the effective time of the merger in exchange for the right to receive equity in rti, and such shares of common stock will in turn be contributed to holdings and be cancelled and retired by virtue of the merger. in addition, each share of restricted stock of the issuer outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, and all outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock, whether or not then exercisable or vested (each, an &#147;option&#148;), will become vested at the effective time of the merger and entitle the holders thereof to receive, for each share of common stock subject to the option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such option. the merger is subject to various conditions, including but not limited to (i) approval of the merger agreement and the merger by the issuer&#146;s shareholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvement act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the receipt of all regulatory approvals required for the consummation of the merger, and (iv) the absence of any temporary restraining order, injunction or other order issued by any governmental authority or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger. in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, on october 19, 2007, each of the management holders entered into a support and voting agreement with rti and holdings, which is attached hereto as exhibit 99.8, 99.9, 99.10 or 99.11, respectively (such agreements, collectively, the &#147;support agreements&#148;), pursuant to which each such person has agreed, among other things: 12 (a) to vote all shares of common stock owned by such person (a) in favor of the merger agreement, (b) against any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the issuer of the merger agreement or a breach by the management holders of the support agreements, (c) against any amendment to the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the issuer or any other action that would reasonably be expected to frustrate the merger, and (d) against any alternative acquisition proposal involving the issuer and/or its subsidiaries; (b) to grant an irrevocable proxy coupled with an interest to rti, which grant would supersede all previous grants of proxy by such person, and to appoint rti as such person&#146;s attorney-in-fact; (c) not to dispose of or encumber any of the shares of common stock or options held by such person before the consummation of the merger; (d) not to solicit any alternative acquisition proposal involving the issuer and/or its subsidiaries, unless such action is permitted pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement; (e) to contribute a portion of his shares of common stock to rti immediately prior to the effective time of the merger in exchange for units of limited liability company interest in rti; (f) to waive any enhanced severance, compensation, tax gross up or other &#147;change of control&#148; payments that would become payable to such person as a result of the consummation of the merger; and (g) to enter into a number of agreements in connection with the consummation of the merger, as more fully described in item 6 below. one of the purposes of the support agreements is to secure the support of certain significant holders of common stock for the proposed merger contemplated by the merger agreement. there can be no assurance, however, that the proposed merger will be consummated or as to the timing or terms thereof. the support agreements will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its terms. as a result of the merger, (i) the by-laws of the surviving corporation would be those of mergersub, replacing the current by-laws of the issuer, (ii) the common stock would cease to be authorized to be quoted on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market, (iii) the common stock would be removed from registration under the exchange act, (iv) the directors of the surviving corporation will be designated pursuant to the securityholders agreement (as defined below), and (v) the officers of the issuer would become the officers of the surviving corporation. the information set forth in items 3 and 6 of this schedule 13d is hereby incorporated herein by reference. except as otherwise described in this schedule 13d, none of the reporting persons nor, to the best knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the persons listed on schedule a, currently has any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the issuer, or the disposition of securities of the issuer; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; (f) any other material change in the issuer&#146;s business or corporate structure; (g) any changes in the issuer&#146;s charter or by-laws or other actions which may impede the acquisition or control of the issuer by any person; (h) causing a class of securities of the issuer to be 13 delisted from a national securities exchange or cease to be authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) causing a class of equity securities of the issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934; or (j) any action similar to those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer the issuer has represented in the merger agreement that as of the close of business on september 30, 2007, there were 23,694,919 shares of common stock outstanding (including 20,711 shares of restricted stock). as of october 19, 2007, the reporting persons beneficially own an aggregate of 9,811,140 shares of common stock (including 603,077 shares issuable upon the exercise of options exercisable within 60 days of october 19, 2007), or approximately 40.4% of the common stock then outstanding. by virtue of their potential status as a &#147;group&#148; for purposes of rule 13d- 5, each of the members of the reporting group may be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive power over the shares owned by other members. neither the filing of this statement nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that any reporting person is the beneficial owner of any common stock referred to in this statement for the purposes of section 13(d) of the act or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is

certain distributions . for purposes of this article iv , a distribution to a member of property (other than cash) shall be treated as a tax distribution pursuant to section 4.4 (rather than as, for example, a distribution pursuant to section 4.1(a), (b) or (c)), in an amount equal to the hypothetical amount of tax that the member would pay, at the assumed tax rate, if (i) such property were not treated as a distribution of money pursuant to section 731(c)(2) of the code (to the extent that section 731(c)(2) otherwise applies) and (ii) the member sold the property immediately after receiving such distribution. article v allocations section 5.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

(b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; except as otherwise provided in section 5.2(a) , if there is a net decrease in company minimum gain during any taxable year, each unitholder shall be allocated income for such taxable year (and, if necessary, for subsequent taxable years) in the amounts and of such character as is determined according to regulations section 1.704-2(f). this section 5.2(b) is intended to be a &#147;minimum gain chargeback&#148; provision that complies with the requirements of regulations section 1.704-2(f), and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith. (c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; if any unitholder that unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( d )( 4 ), ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) has an adjusted capital account deficit as of the end of any taxable year, computed after the application of section 5.2(a) and section 5.2(b) but before the application of any other provision of this article v , then income for such taxable year shall be allocated to such unitholder in proportion to, and to the extent of, such adjusted capital account deficit. this section 5.2(c) is intended to be a &#147;qualified income offset&#148; provision as described in regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( d ) and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.
