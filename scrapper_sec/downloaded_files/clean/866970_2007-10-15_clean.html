(b) conversion notice . in order to convert preferred shares, a holder shall send to the corporation by facsimile transmission, at any time prior to 3:00 p.m., central time, on the business day (as used herein, the term &#147; business day &#148; shall mean any day except a saturday, sunday or day on which the federal reserve bank of dallas, texas is closed in the ordinary course of business) on which such holder wishes to effect such conversion (the &#147; conversion date &#148;), a notice of conversion in substantially the form attached as annex i hereto (a &#147; conversion notice &#148;), stating the number of preferred shares to be converted, and a calculation of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the formula set forth in paragraph 5(c) below setting forth the basis for each component thereof, including the details relating to any adjustments made to the conversion price. the holder shall promptly thereafter send the conversion notice and the certificate or certificates being converted to the corporation. the corporation shall issue a new certificate for preferred shares to the holder in the event that less than all of the preferred shares represented by a certificate are converted; provided, however , that the failure of the corporation to deliver such new certificate shall not affect the right of the holder to submit a further conversion notice with respect to such preferred shares and, in any such case, the holder shall be deemed to have submitted the original of such new certificate at the time that it submits such further conversion notice. except as otherwise provided herein, upon delivery of a conversion notice by a holder in accordance with the terms hereof, such holder shall, as of the applicable conversion date, be deemed for all purposes to be the record owner of the common stock to which such conversion notice relates. in the case of a dispute between the corporation and a holder as to the calculation of the conversion price or the number of conversion shares issuable upon a conversion (including, without limitation, the calculation of any adjustment to the conversion price following any adjustment thereof), the corporation shall issue to such holder the number of conversion shares that are not disputed within the time periods specified in paragraph 5(d) below and shall submit the disputed calculations to a certified public accounting firm of national reputation (other than the corporation&#146;s regularly retained accountants) within two (2) business days following the corporation&#146;s receipt of such holder&#146;s conversion notice. the corporation shall cause such accountant to calculate the conversion price as provided herein and to notify the corporation and such holder of the results in writing no later than three (3) business days following the day on which such accountant received the disputed calculations (the &#147; dispute procedure &#148;). such accountant&#146;s calculation shall be deemed conclusive absent manifest error. the fees of any such accountant shall be borne by the party whose calculations were most at variance with those of such accountant. 3 exhibit 4.2 (c) number of conversion shares . the number of conversion shares to be delivered by the corporation to a holder for each preferred share pursuant to a conversion shall be determined by dividing (i) the purchase price (for the avoidance of doubt, not including the 6% accrual on the preferred shares payable upon a liquidation event) by (ii) the conversion price in effect on the applicable conversion date; provided , however , that the number of conversion shares issued shall never, when combined with all other then outstanding shares of common stock and shares of common stock which have been subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued, exceed the number of shares of common stock then authorized to be issued by the corporation, and in the event that there are insufficient shares of common stock authorized to permit the full conversion contemplated by any conversion notice, the corporation will promptly take all such actions necessary so as to permit the full conversion contemplated by such conversion notice as soon as practicable after receipt by the corporation of such conversion notice. (d) delivery of conversion shares . the corporation shall, no later than the close of business on the third (3 rd ) business day following the later of the date on which the corporation receives a conversion notice from a holder by facsimile transmission pursuant to paragraph 5(b), above, and the date on which the corporation receives the related preferred shares certificate (such third business day, the &#147; delivery date &#148;), issue and deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder the number of conversion shares determined pursuant to paragraph 5(c) above; provided, however , that any conversion shares that are the subject of a dispute procedure shall be delivered no later than the close of business on the third (3 rd ) business day following the determination made pursuant thereto. (e) adjustments . the conversion price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: (i) in the event that the corporation shall (a) pay a dividend or make a distribution, in shares of common stock, on any class of capital stock of the corporation or any subsidiary which is not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the corporation, (b) split or subdivide its outstanding common stock into a greater number of shares, or (c) combine its outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of the series thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of common stock that such holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the occurrence of any of the events described above had such share of the series been converted immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph 5(e)(i) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the effective date in the case of such subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be. any shares of common stock issuable in payment of a dividend shall be deemed to have been issued immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend for purposes of calculating the number of outstanding shares of common stock under clauses (ii) and (iii) below. (ii) in the event that the corporation shall issue or distribute new securities pursuant to an issuance or distribution approved by a majority of the directors nominated by stockholders other than the holders, in any such case at a price per share less than the current market price or that would entitle the holders of the new securities to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than current market price per share 4 (provided that the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of new securities that are rights, warrants, options or convertible or exchangeable securities (&#147; new derivative securities &#148;) will not cause an adjustment in the conversion price if no such adjustment would have been required at the time such new derivative security was issued), then the conversion price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the conversion price shall equal the price at which the corporation issues or distributes such new securities (or the price at which the holders of the new securities are entitled to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock). each such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such new securities are issued. in determining whether any new derivative securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at less than the current market price per share, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the corporation for such new derivative securities, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a certificate filed with the records of corporate proceedings of the corporation. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an adjustment be made under this clause (ii) if such adjustment would result in raising the then-effective conversion price. (iii) no adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the conversion price then in effect; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of this paragraph 5(e)(iii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this paragraph 5(e) shall be made to the nearest cent or nearest 1/100th of a share. (iv) in the event that, at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to paragraph 5(e)(i) through 5(e)(iii) above, the holder of any share of the series thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the corporation other than shares of the common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any share of the series shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the common stock contained in paragraphs 5(e)(i) through 5(e)(iii) above, and the other provisions of this paragraph 5(e) with respect to the common stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (f) in case of any reclassification of the common stock (other than in a transaction to which paragraph 5(e)(i) applies), any consolidation of the corporation with, or merger of the corporation into, any other entity, any merger of another entity into the corporation (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation), any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or any compulsory share exchange, pursuant to which share exchange the common stock is converted into other securities, cash or other property, then lawful provision shall be made as part of the terms of such transaction whereby the holder of each share of the series then outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the period such share shall be convertible, to convert such share only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the corporation into which a share of the series might have been converted immediately prior to the reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange assuming that such holder of common stock failed to exercise rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property 5 exhibit 4.2 receivable upon consummation of such transaction, subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 5(e) above following the date of consummation of such transaction. as a condition to any such transaction, the corporation or the person formed by the consolidation or resulting from the merger or which acquires such assets or which acquires the corporation&#146;s shares, as the case may be, shall make provisions in its certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document to (i) establish such right and (ii) ensure that any such transaction does not, in and of itself, effect the holders&#146; rights to the liquidation value. the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent document, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph 5. the provisions of this paragraph 5(f) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. (g) if: (i) the corporation shall take any action which would require an adjustment in the conversion price pursuant to paragraph 5(e); or (ii) the corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of its common stock generally of rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase any shares of any class or any other rights, warrants or options; or (iii) there shall be any reclassification or change of the common stock (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding common stock or a change in par value) or any consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange to which the corporation is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the corporation is required, or the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation; or (iv) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the corporation; then, the corporation shall cause to be delivered to each holder in accordance with the notice provisions of the exchange and contribution agreement, as promptly as possible, but at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or granting of rights, warrants or options or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of common stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights, warrants or options are to be determined, or (b) the date on which such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of common stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in this paragraph 5(g). (h) the corporation shall promptly cause a notice of the adjusted conversion price to be delivered to each holder. (i) in any case in which paragraph 5(e) provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event and the date fixed for such adjustment pursuant to paragraph 6 exhibit 4.2 5(e) occurs after such record date but before the occurrence of such event, the corporation may defer until the actual occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any preferred shares converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the common stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment. (j) subject to the proviso set forth in paragraph 5(c) hereof, the corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the shares of the series the maximum number of each of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock as is reasonably anticipated to be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock, or any other actions necessary or desirable, if at any time there shall be insufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of the series. 6. status of shares . all preferred shares that are at any time converted pursuant to paragraph 5 above, and all preferred shares that are otherwise reacquired by the corporation and subsequently canceled by the board of directors, shall be retired and shall not be subject to reissuance. 7. voting rights . each share of the series shall entitle the holder thereof to 3.5 votes for each conversion share into which such share of the series is then convertible, which on the initial date of issuance of the preferred shares shall equal, when combined with the shares of common stock held by the initial holder on the initial date of issuance of the preferred shares, in the aggregate not less than 80% of the total votes of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the common stock (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law), voting together with the common stock as a single class and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders&#146; meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation. fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted, and any fractional voting rights (after aggregating all shares into which shares of the series held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward). 8. restrictions and limitations . so long as any preferred shares remain outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the vote or written consent by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding preferred shares, voting together as a single class: (i) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for value (or pay into or set aside for a sinking or other analogous fund for such purpose) any share or shares of its capital stock, except for (a) a transaction in which all outstanding shares of preferred stock are concurrently redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired, (b) conversion into or exchange for shares of capital stock of the corporation that are both (x) junior liquidation shares, and (y) no greater than pari passu with the preferred shares with respect to the payment of dividends, or (c) the redemption of the 6% preferred when due pursuant to the terms of this restated certificate of incorporation; provided, however , that this restriction shall not apply to the repurchase of shares of common stock from employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons performing services for the corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to agreements under which the corporation has the option to repurchase such shares at cost or at cost plus interest at a rate not to exceed nine percent 7 exhibit 4.2 (9%) per annum, or, if lower than cost, at fair market value, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the termination of employment;

upon any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which the sale of such registrable securities was registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to such registration statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the company of the securities act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the company and relating to action or inaction required of the company in connection with any such registration; and the company shall promptly reimburse the investor indemnified party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such investor indemnified party in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided , however , that the company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the company, in writing, by the selling holder with which such investor indemnified party is affiliated expressly for use therein. the company also shall indemnify any underwriter of the registrable securities, their officers, affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification provided above in this section 4.1. 4.2 indemnification by holders of registrable securities . each selling holder of registrable securities will, in the event that any registration is being effected under the securities act pursuant to this agreement of any registrable securities held by such selling 11 holder, indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors and officers and each underwriter (if any), and each other selling holder and each other person, if any, who controls another selling holder or such underwriter within the meaning of the securities act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which the sale of such registrable securities was registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or supplement to the registration statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or the alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the company by such selling holder expressly for use therein, and shall reimburse the company, its directors and officers, and each other selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. each selling holder's indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by such selling holder from the sale of registrable securities which gave rise to such indemnification obligation. 4.3 conduct of indemnification proceedings . promptly after receipt by any person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the &#147; indemnified party &#148;) shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the &#147; indemnifying party &#148;) in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or action; provided , however , that the failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to such indemnified party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure. if the indemnified party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with all other indemnifying parties, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume control of the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided , however , that in any action in which both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party are named as defendants, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the indemnified party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the indemnified party against the indemnifying party, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such indemnifying party if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. no indemnifying party shall, without the 12 prior written consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. 4.4 contribution . 4.4.1 if the indemnification provided for in the foregoing sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified parties and the indemnifying parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of any indemnified party and any indemnifying party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnified party or such indemnifying party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 4.4.2 the parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding section 4.4.1. 4.4.3 the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. notwithstanding the provisions of this section 4.4, no holder of registrable securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from the sale of registrable securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 5. underwriting and distribution . 5.1 rule 144 . the company covenants that it shall file any reports required to be filed by it under the securities act and the exchange act and shall take such further action as the holders of registrable securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders to sell registrable securities without registration under the securities 13 act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the securities act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. 6. miscellaneous . 6.1 other registration rights . except with respect to (i) the company&#146;s 6% convertible preferred

stock for sale or to include shares of the company's capital stock in any registration filed by the company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of any other person. the investor hereby agrees that it shall not cause the company to file with the commission a registration statement covering the resale of the registrable securities for an offering to be made

obligations of the holders of registrable securities hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of registrable securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer by any

the parties and their respective successors and the permitted assigns of the investor or holder of registrable securities or of any assignee of the investor or holder of registrable securities. this
