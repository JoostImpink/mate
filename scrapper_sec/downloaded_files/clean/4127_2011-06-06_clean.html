stockholder agreement &#148;), dated as of may 26, 2011, with the following directors and officers of the company (each a &#147; stockholder &#148; and collectively, the &#147; stockholders &#148;): richard k. williams, samuel j. anderson, jason l. carlson, jaff lin, thomas p. redfern, chandramohan subramanian, jun-wei chen, ashok chandran and kevin d&#146;angelo. the stockholders own 2,576,028 issued and outstanding shares of company common stock, options currently vested or vesting in the 60 days following may 26, 2011 (without giving effect to any acceleration that may occur upon consummation of the merger) that are exercisable for 2,430,725 shares of company common stock, and restricted stock units that are currently vested or vesting in the 60 days following may 26, 2011 (without giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that may occur upon consummation of the merger) that are subject to settlement in stock for a total of 0 shares of company common stock, representing, in the aggregate 11.03% of the 42,971,079 shares outstanding as of may 24, 2011. under the terms of the stockholder agreement, any shares of company common stock received by the stockholders upon the exercise of stock options or the settlement of restricted stock units are subject to the provisions of the stockholder agreement. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, each stockholder has agreed to vote all shares of company common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and against any other acquisition proposal or alternative acquisition agreement made in opposition to the consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the stockholders have also granted the buyer an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of company common stock at any meeting of stockholders called with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. cusip no. 00752j108 13d page 5 of 11 pages in connection with the merger agreement, the buyer has entered into a non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreement, dated as of may 26, 2011, with richard k. williams, the president, chief executive officer and chief technology officer of the company (the &#147; non-competition agreement &#148;), pursuant to which, among other things, mr. williams has agreed, for a period of 24 months and subject to certain exceptions, not to engage, without the express prior written consent of the buyer, in any business or activity that is in competition with the company&#146;s business of developing, designing, manufacturing, licensing, marketing, selling and distributing power management semiconductors and related software. references to, and descriptions of, the merger agreement, the stockholder agreement and the non-competition agreement as set forth herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the merger agreement, stockholder agreement and non-competition agreement, respectively, copies of which are filed as exhibits 1, 2 and 3, respectively, hereto and which are incorporated by reference in this item 3 in their entirety where such references and descriptions appear. item 4. purpose of transactions. as described in item 3, the buyer acquired beneficial ownership of the shares of company common stock covered by the stockholders agreement as a condition to entering into the merger agreement. under applicable corporate law, for the merger to be completed, the merger agreement must be adopted by the affirmative votes of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of company common stock. the shares of company common stock covered by the stockholders agreement represent a portion of the required votes, but significantly less than the required majority, and therefore do not guarantee receipt of the required stockholder approval. in addition, each stockholder signed the stockholders agreement solely in such stockholder&#146;s capacity as an owner of his shares of company common stock and nothing in the stockholders agreement prohibits, prevents or precludes such stockholder from taking or not taking any action in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the company, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. under certain circumstances, the merger agreement allows the company&#146;s board of directors to withdraw its support for the merger agreement and, in certain circumstances, including circumstances involving the receipt of an unsolicited superior proposal, to terminate the merger agreement. if the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the stockholders agreement terminates concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement and the proxy granted to the buyer automatically terminates. except as set forth in item 3, the buyer does not have any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b) for the purpose of rule 13d-3 promulgated under the exchange act, the buyer, by reason of the execution and delivery of the stockholder agreement, may be deemed to have beneficial ownership (within the meaning of rule 13d-3 under the exchange act) of 5,006,753 shares which are subject to the stockholder agreement, which represent approximately 11.03% of the shares (based on the number of shares outstanding as of may 24, 2011). except as set forth in this item 5, the buyer does not, and to its knowledge, any person listed in schedule i hereto does not, beneficially own any shares. with respect to the voting of the shares, the buyer has the power to vote or cause the vote of the shares in accordance with the terms of the stockholder agreement. neither the filing of this statement nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission that the buyer is the beneficial owner of the shares referred cusip no. 00752j108 13d page 6 of 11 pages to in this item 5 for purposes of section 13(d) of the exchange act or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. furthermore, because the buyer does not have any pecuniary interest in the shares of common stock covered by the stockholder agreement, beneficial ownership over such shares is expressly disclaimed for reporting purposes. (c) except for the execution and delivery of the stockholder agreement and the merger agreement, no transaction in shares of company common stock were effected by the buyer or, to its knowledge, any person listed in schedule i hereto, during the 60 days prior to the date hereof. (d) except for the agreements described in this statement, to the knowledge of the buyer, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities of the company reported herein. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. the information set forth in items 3 through 5 of this statement is hereby incorporated by reference in this item 6. other than described in this statement, to the knowledge of the buyer, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in item 2 and schedule i and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the company, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the securities, joint ventures, loan or option agreements, puts or calls, guarantees or profits, division of profit or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies. item 7. materials to be filed as exhibits. exhibit 1: agreement and plan of merger, dated as of may 26, 2011, by and among skyworks solutions, inc., powerco acquisition corp. and advanced analogic technologies incorporated (incorporated by reference to exhibit 2.1 to the company&#146;s current report on form 8-k (file no. 000-51349), filed with the sec on may 27, 2011). exhibit 2: stockholder agreement, dated as of may 26, 2011, by and among skyworks solutions, inc. and certain directors and officers of advanced analogic technologies incorporated (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 to the company&#146;s current report on form 8-k (file no. 000-51349), filed with the sec on may 27, 2011). exhibit 3: non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreement, dated as of may 26, 2011, by and between skyworks solutions, inc. and richard k. williams (incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.2 to the company&#146;s current report on form 8-k (file no. 000-51349), filed with the sec on may 27, 2011). cusip no. 00752j108 13d page 7 of 11 pages signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, the undersigned hereby certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. executed as a sealed instrument this 6th day of june, 2011. skyworks solutions, inc. by: /s/ mark v.b. tremallo name: mark v.b. tremallo title: vice president, general counsel and secretary cusip no. 00752j108 13d page 8 of 11 pages schedule i directors and executive officers of the buyer the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and material occupations, positions, officers or employment for the past five years for each of the directors and executive officers of the buyer are set forth below. unless otherwise specified below, the business address and phone number for each such director and executive officer is 20 sylvan road, woburn, massachusetts, 01801, (781) 376-3000, and each is a citizen of the united states. directors david j. mclachlan , age 72, has been a director since 2000 and chairman of the board since may 2008. mr. mclachlan served as a senior advisor to the chairman and chief executive officer of genzyme corporation (a publicly traded biotechnology company) from 1999 to 2004. he also was the executive vice president and chief financial officer of genzyme from 1989 to 1999. prior to joining genzyme, mr. mclachlan served as vice president and chief financial officer of adams-russell company (an electronic component supplier and cable television franchise owner). mr. mclachlan also serves on the board of directors of dyax corp.
