(c) loss limitation. losses allocated pursuant to section 6.5 hereof shall, to the extent possible, not exceed the maximum amount of losses that can be allocated without causing any member to have an adjusted capital account deficit at the end of any fiscal year. in the event some but not all of the members would have adjusted capital account deficits as a consequence of an allocation of losses pursuant 28 to section 6.5 hereof, the limitation set forth in this section 6.6(c) shall be applied on a member by member basis and losses not allocable to any member as a result of such limitation shall be allocated to the other members in accordance with the positive balances in such member's capital accounts so as to allocate the maximum permissible losses to each member under section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the treasury regulations. any remaining losses shall be allocated to the members in the proportion and to the extent to which such members bear the economic risk with respect to such losses. (d) curative allocations. the allocations set forth in section 6.6 hereof (the "regulatory allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of the treasury regulations. it is the intent of the members that, to the extent possible, all regulatory allocations shall be offset either with other regulatory allocations or with special allocations of other items of company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this section 6.6(d). therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this article vi (other than the regulatory allocations), to the extent permitted under the treasury regulations, the board of managers shall make such offsetting special allocations of company income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each member's capital account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the capital account balance such member would have had if the regulatory allocations were not part of the agreement and all company items were allocated pursuant to section 6.5. 6.7. other allocation rules. (a) for purposes of determining the profits, losses, or any other items allocable to any period, profits, losses, and any such other items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as determined by the board of managers using any permissible method under code section 706 and the treasury regulations thereunder. (b) the members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations made by this article vi and hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this article vi in reporting their shares of company income and loss for income tax purposes. (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article vi, the board of managers shall be permitted to allocate profits and losses and gross items of income, gain, loss and deduction and to adjust the members' capital accounts in the manner the board of managers, in its reasonable discretion, deems required to cause the capital account balances of the members to be consistent with the distribution provisions of article vii. 6.8. tax allocations: code section 704(c). (a) for tax purposes, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit, shall be allocated in the same manner as are profits and losses and 29 items of income, gain, loss and deduction pursuant to sections 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7; provided, however, that in accordance with code section 704(c) and the treasury regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and deductions with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the company for federal income tax purposes and its initial book value (computed in accordance with the definition of book value) using any permissible method as provided in the treasury regulations. (b) in the event the book value of any company asset is adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of the definition of book value, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss and deductions with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes and its book value in the same manner as under code section 704(c) and the treasury regulations thereunder using any permissible method as provided in the treasury regulations. (c) any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall be made by the board of managers in its sole discretion. allocations pursuant to this section 6.8 are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing any member's capital account or share of profits, losses, other items or distributions pursuant to any provisions of this agreement.
