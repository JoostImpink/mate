otherwise, that may purport to contain information about the company, including in newspaper articles, internet chat rooms and other publications and communications, and that such statements (unless made by an authorized officer of the company) have been and may be incorrect or inaccurate in several material respects. purchaser agrees that neither the company nor any of its affiliates or representatives has made any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information or statements. furthermore, the purchaser has not relied, and will not rely, upon any
