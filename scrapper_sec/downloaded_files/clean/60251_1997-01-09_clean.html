option to purchase such shares has been exercised. 14. type of reporting person co item 1. security and issuer. this schedule 13d relates to the common stock, par value $0.33 1/3 per share ("bug common stock"), of the brooklyn union gas company, a new york corporation ("bug"). the principal executive offices of bug are located at one metrotech center, brooklyn, new york 11201-3850. item 2. identity and background. this schedule 13d is filed by long island lighting company, a new york corporation ("lilco"). lilco supplies electric and gas service in nassau and suffolk counties and to the rockaway peninsula in queens county, all on long island, new york. lilco's principal executive offices are located at 175 east old country road, hicksville, new york 11801. each executive officer and each director of lilco is a citizen of the united states. the name, business address and present principal occupation of each executive officer and director are set forth in annex i to this schedule 13d which is incorporated herein by this reference. during the last five years, to the best of lilco's knowledge, neither lilco nor any of its executive officers or directors has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which lilco or such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or finding any violation with respect to such laws, and which judgment, decree or final order was not subsequently vacated. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. pursuant to a stock option agreement, dated as of december 29, 1996, between brooklyn union and lilco (the "bug stock option agreement"), bug granted lilco an irrevocable option (the "bug option") to purchase from bug, under certain circumstances and subject to certain adjustments, up to 9,948,682 authorized and unissued shares of bug common stock, at a price per share of $30.0375 (the "purchase price"), payable, at lilco's option, (a) in cash or (b) subject to bug's having obtained the approvals of any governmental authority required for bug to acquire such shares of lilco common stock (as defined below) from bug, in shares of common stock, par value 85 per share, of lilco ("lilco common stock"). as of the date hereof, the bug option is not exercisable. the shares of bug common stock subject to the bug option would equal 19.9% of the outstanding bug common stock before giving effect to the exercise of the bug option and 16.6% page 3 of 12 pages of the outstanding bug common stock after giving effect to the exercise of the bug option. under certain circumstances, lilco may require bug to, or bug may be permitted to, repurchase for cash the bug option and any shares of bug common stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the bug option. the bug option was granted by bug as a condition of and in consideration for lilco entering into the agreement and plan of exchange, by and among nyeco corp., a new york corporation ("nyeco" or, from and after the consummation of the binding share exchanges (as defined below), the "company"), bug and lilco, dated as of december 29, 1996 (the "exchange agreement"), and the lilco stock option agreement, by and between bug and lilco, dated as of december 29, 1996 (the "lilco stock option agreement"), each as described below. the exercise of the bug option for the full number of shares currently covered thereby would require aggregate funds of $298,833,535. it is anticipated that, should the bug option become exercisable and should lilco determine to exercise the bug option for cash, lilco would obtain the funds from working capital or by borrowing from parties whose identity is not yet known. a copy of the bug stock option agreement is included as exhibit 2.3 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the bug stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. item 4. purpose of transaction. in connection with the execution of the bug stock option agreement, bug, lilco and nyeco entered into the exchange agreement, pursuant to which, among other matters and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the exchange agreement, each outstanding share of lilco common stock will be exchanged for .803 (the "ratio") of a newly issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of nyeco (the "nyeco common stock") and each outstanding share of bug common stock will be exchanged for one newly issued share of nyeco common stock (collectively, the "binding share exchanges"). also in connection with the execution of the bug stock option agreement, bug and lilco entered into the lilco stock option agreement, pursuant to which lilco granted bug an irrevocable option (the "lilco option") to purchase from lilco, under certain circumstances and subject to certain adjustments, up to 23,981,964 authorized and unissued shares of lilco common stock, at a price per share of $19.725, payable, at bug's option, (a) in cash or (b) subject to bug's having obtained the approvals of any governmental authority required for bug to acquire such shares of lilco common stock from lilco, in shares of lilco common stock. the lilco option was granted by lilco as a condition of and in consideration for page 4 of 12 pages bug entering into the exchange agreement and the bug stock option agreement. consummation of the binding share exchanges is subject to certain conditions, including among other things: (i) receipt of the approval of the exchange agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of lilco common stock and by two-thirds of the outstanding shares of bug common stock; (ii) registration of the shares of nyeco common stock to be issued in the binding share exchanges under the securities act of 1933, as amended; (iii) approval for listing of the shares of nyeco common stock to be issued in the binding share exchanges on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") upon official notice of issuance; (iv) receipt of required approvals by governmental authorities, which approvals shall have become final and shall not impose terms or conditions which, in the aggregate, would have, or insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, could have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the company and its prospective subsidiaries taken as a whole or which would be materially inconsistent with the agreements of the parties contained in the exchange agreement; (v) receipt by each of bug and lilco of a letter from their respective independent public accountants confirming that the transactions effected pursuant to the exchange agreement will qualify as a pooling of interests transaction under generally accepted accounting principles and applicable regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission; and (vi) satisfaction of certain other conditions. pursuant to the exchange agreement, upon consummation of the binding share exchanges, (a) the number of directors comprising the full board of directors of the company will be 15 persons, six of whom will be designated by bug, six of whom will be designated by lilco and three of whom will be designated by a committee consisting of two current bug directors and two current lilco directors and (b) dr. william j. catacosinos will be the chairman of the board of directors, chairman of the executive committee and chief executive officer of the company, and mr. robert b. catell will be president and chief operating officer of the company. upon consummation of the binding share exchanges, each of the lilco common stock and the bug common stock will be delisted from the nyse. pursuant to the exchange agreement, at the first anniversary of the effective time of the binding share exchanges, dr. catacosinos will cease to be the chief executive officer, will continue to be chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee and will become a consultant of the company, and mr. catell will succeed dr. catacosinos as chief executive officer of the company. a copy of the exchange agreement is included as exhibit 2.1 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the exchange agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. page 5 of 12 pages a copy of the lilco stock option agreement is included as exhibit 2.2 to this schedule 13d and is incorporated herein by this reference. the foregoing description of the lilco stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. bug and lilco contemplate that discussions will continue with the long island power authority ("lipa") to arrive at an agreement, mutually acceptable to each of bug and lilco, pursuant to which lipa would acquire certain assets or securities of lilco, the consideration for which would inure to the benefit of the company. in such event, the ratio will automatically be revised to, and become, .880. bug and lilco will continue their respective current dividend policies until the closing of the binding share exchanges. it is expected that the company's dividend policy will be determined prior to closing. except as set forth herein, lilco does not have any current plans or proposals that relate to or would result in (i) the acquisition by any person of additional shares of bug common stock or the disposition of shares of bug common stock; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving bug or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) a sale or transfer of any material amount of assets of bug or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) any change in the present board of directors or management of bug, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any vacancies on the board; (v) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of bug; (vi) any other material change in bug's business or corporate structure; (vii) any change in bug's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto, or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of bug by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of bug to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (ix) a class of equity securities of bug becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended; or (x) any action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5. interest in securities of issuer. although the bug option does not allow lilco to purchase any shares of bug common stock pursuant thereto unless and until the conditions to exercise specified in the bug stock option agreement occur, assuming for purposes of this item 5 that such conditions are satisfied and lilco is entitled to purchase shares of bug common stock pursuant to the bug option, lilco would currently be entitled to purchase 9,948,682 shares of bug common stock, or approximately 19.9% of the currently outstanding page 6 of 12 pages bug common stock before giving effect to the exercise of the bug option and 16.6% of the currently outstanding bug common stock after giving effect to the exercise of the bug option (based upon 49,993,378 shares of bug common stock outstanding as of december 18, 1996, as represented by bug in the exchange agreement). lilco does not have the right to acquire any shares of bug common stock under the bug option unless certain events specified in the bug stock option agreement occur. accordingly, lilco does not have sole or shared voting or dispositive power with respect to any shares of bug common stock purchasable under the bug option, and lilco disclaims beneficial ownership of bug common stock subject to the bug option until such events occur. assuming for purposes of this item 5 that events occurred that would enable lilco to exercise the bug option and lilco exercised the bug option, lilco would have sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the shares of bug common stock acquired pursuant to the bug option. the foregoing description of certain terms of the bug stock option agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the bug stock option agreement which is filed as exhibit 2.3 hereto and which is incorporated herein by this reference. to the best of lilco's knowledge, no executive officer or director of lilco beneficially owns any shares of bug common stock, nor (except for the issuance of the bug option) have any transactions in bug common stock been effected during the past 60 days by bug or, to the best knowledge of bug, by any executive officer or director of lilco. in addition, no other person is known by lilco to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities covered by this schedule 13d. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits. the following exhibits are filed as part of this schedule 13d: exhibit 2.1 -- exchange

december 29, 1996 by and among the brooklyn union gas company, a new york corporation ("bug"), and long island lighting company, a new york corporation (the "company"). whereas, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, (i) bug, the company and nyeco corp., a new york corporation ("nyeco"), are entering into an agreement and plan of exchange, dated as of the date hereof (the "exchange agreement"), which provides, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, for the exchange of outstanding shares of capital stock of each of bug and the company for newly issued shares of capital stock of nyeco (the "binding share exchange"), and (ii) the company and bug are entering into a certain stock option agreement dated as of the date hereof whereby bug grants to the company an option with respect to certain shares of bug's common stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the "bug stock option agreement"); and whereas, as a condition to bug's willingness to enter into the exchange agreement, bug has requested that the company agree, and the company has so agreed, to grant to bug an option with respect to certain shares of the company's common stock, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. now, therefore, to induce bug to enter into the exchange agreement, and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the exchange agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. grant of option. the company hereby grants bug an irrevocable option (the "company option") to purchase up to 23,981,964 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in section 11 (such shares being referred to herein as the "company shares") of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the company (the "company common stock") (being 19.9% of the number of shares of company common stock outstanding on the date hereof) in the manner set forth below at a price (the "exercise price") per company share of $19.725 (which is equal to the fair market value (as defined below) of a company share on the date hereof) payable, at bug's option, (a) in cash or (b) subject to the company's having obtained the approvals of any governmental authority required for the company to acquire the bug shares (as defined below) from bug, which approvals the company shall use best

the number of company shares for which the company option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of company common stock. as used herein, the "fair market value" of any share shall be the average of the daily closing sales price for such share on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") during the 10 nyse trading days prior to the fifth nyse trading day preceding the date such fair market value is to be determined. capitalized -1 terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the exchange agreement. 2. exercise of option. the company option may be exercised by bug, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time after the exchange agreement becomes terminable by bug under circumstances which could entitle bug to termination fees under either section 9.3(a) of the exchange agreement (provided that the events specified in section 9.3(a)(ii)(x) of the exchange agreement shall have occurred, although the events specified in section 9.3(a)(ii)(y) thereof need not have occurred) or section 9.3(b) of the exchange agreement (regardless of whether the exchange agreement is actually terminated or whether there occurs a closing of any business combination involving a target party or a closing by which a target party becomes a subsidiary), any such event by which the exchange agreement becomes so terminable by bug being referred to herein as a "trigger event." the company shall notify bug promptly in writing of the occurrence of any trigger event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by the company shall not be a condition to the right of bug to exercise the company option. in the event bug wishes to exercise the company option, bug shall deliver to the company a written notice (an "exercise notice") specifying the total number of company shares it wishes to purchase. each closing of a purchase of company shares (a "closing") shall occur at a place, on a date and at a time designated by bug in an exercise notice delivered at least two business days prior to the date of the closing. the company option shall terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the effective time; (ii) the termination of the exchange agreement pursuant to section 9.1 thereof (other than upon or during the continuance of a trigger event); or (iii) 180 days following any termination of the exchange agreement upon or during the continuance of a trigger event (or if, at the expiration of such 180 day period the company option cannot be exercised by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, 10 business days after such impediment to exercise shall have been removed or shall have become final and not subject to appeal, but in no event under this clause (iii) later than june 30, 1998). notwithstanding the foregoing, the company option may not be exercised if bug is in material breach of any of its material representations or warranties, or in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements, contained in this agreement or in the exchange agreement. upon the giving by bug to the company of the exercise notice and the tender of the applicable aggregate exercise price, bug shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the company shares issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the company shall then be closed or that certificates representing such company shares shall not then be actually delivered to bug. 3. conditions to closing. the obligation of the company to issue the company shares to bug hereunder is subject to the conditions, which (other than the conditions described in clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) below) may be waived by the company in its sole discretion, that (i) all waiting periods, if any, under the hsr act, applicable to the issuance of the company shares hereunder shall have expired or have been terminated; (ii) the company shares, and any bug shares which are issued in payment of the exercise price, shall have been approved for listing on the nyse upon official -2 notice of issuance; (iii) all consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, any federal, state or local administrative agency or commission or other federal, state or local governmental authority, if any, required in connection with the issuance of the company shares hereunder shall have been obtained or made, as the case may be, including, without limitation, if applicable, the approval of the sec under section 10 of the 1935 act of the acquisition of the company shares by bug and, if applicable, the acquisition by the company of the bug shares constituting the exercise price hereunder; and (iv) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise restraining such issuance shall be in effect. 4. closing. at any closing, (a) the company will deliver to bug or its designee a single certificate in definitive form representing the number of the company shares designated by bug in its exercise notice, such certificate to be registered in the name of bug and to bear the legend set forth in section 12, and (b) bug will deliver to the company the aggregate price for the company shares so designated and being purchased by (i) wire transfer of immediately available funds or certified check or bank check or (ii) subject to the condition in section 1(b), a certificate or certificates representing the number of bug shares being issued by bug in consideration thereof, as the case may be. for the purposes of this agreement, the number of bug shares to be delivered to the company shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of (x) the number of company shares with respect to which the company option is being exercised and (y) the exercise price by (ii) the fair market value of the bug shares on the date immediately preceding the date the exercise notice is delivered to the company. the company shall pay all expenses, and any and all united states federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this section 4 in the name of bug or its designee. 5. representations and warranties of the company. the company represents and warrants

new york and has the corporate power and authority to enter into this agreement and, subject to obtaining the applicable approval of shareholders of the company for the repurchase of company shares

constitutes a valid and binding obligation of bug, is enforceable against the company in accordance with its terms, (e) the company has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve for issuance and to permit it to issue, upon exercise of the company option, and at all times from the date hereof through the expiration of the company option will have reserved, 23,981,964

agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (f) upon delivery of the company shares to bug upon the exercise of the company option, bug will acquire the company shares free and clear of all claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any nature whatsoever, (g) except as described in section 5.4(b) of the exchange agreement, the execution and delivery of

constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on assets (any such conflict,

(b) redelivery of bug shares. if bug elected to purchase company shares pursuant to the exercise of the company option by the issuance and delivery of bug shares, then the company shall, if so requested by bug, in fulfillment of its obligation pursuant to clause (a) of section 7(a)(ii)(x) (that is, with respect to the exercise price only and without limitation to its obligation to pay additional consideration under clause (b) of section 7(a)(ii)(x)), redeliver the certificate for such bug shares to bug, free and clear of all liens, claims, damages, charges and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever; provided, however, that if less than all of the company shares purchased by bug pursuant to the company option are to be repurchased pursuant to this section 7, then bug shall issue to the company a new certificate representing those bug shares which are not due to be redelivered to bug pursuant to this section 7 as -6 they constituted payment of the exercise price for the company shares not being repurchased.

board of directors of such other party which majority shall include a majority of directors who were directors prior to the announcement of such tender or exchange offer. 9. registration rights. following the termination of the exchange agreement, each party hereto (a "designated holder") may by written notice (the "registration notice") to the other party (the "registrant") request the registrant to register under the securities act all or any part of the restricted shares beneficially owned by such designated holder (the "registrable securities") pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the designated holder and the underwriters shall effect as wide a distribution of such registrable securities as is reasonably practicable and shall use their best efforts to prevent any person (including any group (as used in rule 13d-5 under the exchange act)) and its affiliates form purchasing through such offering restricted shares representing more than 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the registrant on a fully diluted basis (a "permitted offering"). the registration notice shall include a certificate executed by the designated holder and its proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing (the "manager"), stating that (i) they have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering and (ii) the manager in good faith believes that, based on the then prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities at a per share price equal to at least 80% of the then fair market value of such shares. the registrant (and/or any person designated by the registrant) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to the designated holder within 10 business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all or any part of the registrable securities proposed to be so sold for cash at a price (the "option price") equal to the product of (i) the number of registrable securities to be so purchased by the registrant and (ii) the then fair market value of such shares. any such purchase of registrable securities by the registrant (or its designee) hereunder shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the registrant or at the offices of its counsel at any reasonable date and time designated by the registrant and/or such designee in such notice within 20 business days after delivery of such notice. any payment for the shares to be purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing of the option price in immediately available funds. if the registrant does not elect to exercise its option pursuant to this section 10 with respect to all registrable securities, it shall use its best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities proposed to be so sold; provided, however,, that (i) neither party shall be entitled to more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements hereunder and (ii) the registrant will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 40 days after such request in the case of clause (a) below or 90 days in the case of clauses (b) and (c) below) when (a) the registrant is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, in the opinion of counsel to the registrant, -8 such information would have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time: (b) the registrant is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) the registrant determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving the registrant or any of its affiliates. the registrant shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 10 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as the designated holder may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that the registrant shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. the registration rights set forth in this section 10 are subject to the condition that the designated holder shall provide the registrant with such information with respect to such holder's registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to such holder as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the registrant, is necessary to enable the registrant to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. a registration effected under this section 10 shall be effected at the registrant's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and the expenses of counsel to the designated holder, and the registrant shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner, (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary for transactions of such type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering and (iii) to take all further actions which shall be reasonably necessary to effect such registration and sale (including, if the manager deems it necessary, participating in road-show presentations). the registrant shall be entitled to include (at its expense) additional shares of its common stock in a registration effected pursuant to this section 10 only if and to the extent the manager determines that such inclusion will not adversely affect the prospects of success of such offering. 10. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. without limitation to any restriction on the company contained in this agreement or in the exchange agreement, in the event of any change in company common stock by reason of stock dividends, splitups, mergers (other than the binding share exchanges), recapitalizations, combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the company option, and the purchase price per share -9 provided in section 1, shall be adjusted appropriately to restore to bug its rights hereunder, including the right to purchase from the company (or its successors) shares of company common stock representing 19.9% of the outstanding company common stock for the aggregate exercise price calculated as of the date of this agreement as provided in section 1. 11. restrictive legends. each certificate representing shares of company common stock issued to bug hereunder, and bug shares, if any, delivered to the company at a closing, shall include a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement, dated as of december 29, 1996, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer upon request. it is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the securities act in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates(s) without such reference if bug or the company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the other party a copy of a letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the other party, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act; (ii) the reference to the provisions to this agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 10 shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in section 12. 12. binding effect; no assignment; no third party beneficiaries. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. except as expressly provided for in this agreement, neither this agreement nor the rights or the obligations of either party hereto are assignable, except by operation of law, or with the written consent of the other party. nothing contained in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted assigns any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever by reason of this agreement. any restricted shares sold by a party in compliance with the provisions of section 10 shall, upon consummation of such sale, be free of the restrictions imposed with respect to such shares by this agreement, unless and until such party shall -10 repurchase or otherwise become the beneficial owner of such shares, and any transferee of such shares shall not be entitled to the registration rights of such party. 13. specific performance. the parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this agreement. in the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is adequate remedy at law. 14. entire agreement. this agreement, the bug stock option agreement, the confidentiality agreement and the exchange agreement (including the exhibits and schedules thereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 15. further assurances. each party will execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 16. validity. the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. in the event any court or other competent authority holds any provisions of this agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith the execution and delivery of an amendment to this agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision and the economic effects thereof. if for any reason any such court or regulatory agency determines that bug is not permitted to acquire, or the company is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to section 7, the full number of shares of company common stock provided in section 1 hereof (as the same may be adjusted), it is the express intention of the company to allow bug to acquire or to require the company to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. each party agrees that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action inconsistent herewith,or not take any action required herein, the other party shall not be entitled to specific performance of such provision or part hereof or to any other remedy, including but not limited to money damages, for breach hereof or of any other provision of this agreement or part hereof as the result of such holding or order. -11 17. notices. all notices and other

(b) redelivery of lilco shares. if lilco elected to purchase company shares pursuant to the exercise of the company option by the issuance and delivery of lilco shares, then the company shall, if so requested by lilco, in fulfillment of its obligation pursuant to clause (a) of section 7(a)(ii)(x) (that is, with respect to the exercise price only and without limitation to its obligation to pay additional consideration under clause (b) of section 7(a)(ii)(x)), redeliver the certificate for such lilco shares to lilco, free and clear of all liens, claims, damages, charges and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever; provided, however, that if less than all of the company shares purchased by lilco pursuant to the company option are to be repurchased pursuant to this section 7, then lilco shall issue to the company a new certificate representing those lilco shares which are not due to be redelivered to -6 lilco pursuant to this section 7 as they constituted payment of the exercise price for the company shares not being repurchased.

exchange offer that has been approved or recommended, or otherwise determined to be fair to and in the best interests of the -7 shareholders of the other party, by a majority of the members of the board of directors of such other party which majority shall include a majority of directors who were directors prior to the announcement of such tender or exchange offer. 9. registration rights. following the termination of the exchange agreement, each party hereto (a "designated holder") may by written notice (the "registration notice") to the other party (the "registrant") request the registrant to register under the securities act all or any part of the restricted shares beneficially owned by such designated holder (the "registrable securities") pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the designated holder and the underwriters shall effect as wide a distribution of such registrable securities as is reasonably practicable and shall use their best efforts to prevent any person (including any group (as used in rule 13d-5 under the exchange act)) and its affiliates form purchasing through such offering restricted shares representing more than 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the registrant on a fully diluted basis (a "permitted offering"). the registration notice shall include a certificate executed by the designated holder and its proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing (the "manager"), stating that (i) they have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering and (ii) the manager in good faith believes that, based on the then prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities at a per share price equal to at least 80% of the then fair market value of such shares. the registrant (and/or any person designated by the registrant) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to the designated holder within 10 business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all or any part of the registrable securities proposed to be so sold for cash at a price (the "option price") equal to the product of (i) the number of registrable securities to be so purchased by the registrant and (ii) the then fair market value of such shares. any such purchase of registrable securities by the registrant (or its designee) hereunder shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the registrant or at the offices of its counsel at any reasonable date and time designated by the registrant and/or such designee in such notice within 20 business days after delivery of such notice. any payment for the shares to be purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing of the option price in immediately available funds. if the registrant does not elect to exercise its option pursuant to this section 10 with respect to all registrable securities, it shall use its best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities proposed to be so sold; provided, however, that (i) neither party shall be entitled to more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements hereunder and (ii) the registrant will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 40 days after such request in the case of clause (a) below or 90 days in the case of clauses (b) and (c) below) when (a) the registrant is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, in the opinion of counsel to the registrant, -8 such information would have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time: (b) the registrant is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) the registrant determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving the registrant or any of its affiliates. the registrant shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 10 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as the designated holder may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that the registrant shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. the registration rights set forth in this section 10 are subject to the condition that the designated holder shall provide the registrant with such information with respect to such holder's registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to such holder as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the registrant, is necessary to enable the registrant to include in such registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. a registration effected under this section 10 shall be effected at the registrant's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and the expenses of counsel to the designated holder, and the registrant shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner, (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary for transactions of such type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering and (iii) to take all further actions which shall be reasonably necessary to effect such registration and sale (including, if the manager deems it necessary, participating in road-show presentations). the registrant shall be entitled to include (at its expense) additional shares of its common stock in a registration effected pursuant to this section 10 only if and to the extent the manager determines that such inclusion will not adversely affect the prospects of success of such offering. 10. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. without limitation to any restriction on the company contained in this agreement or in the exchange agreement, in the event of any change in company common stock by reason of stock dividends, splitups, mergers (other than the binding share exchanges), recapitalizations, combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the company option, and the purchase price per share -9 provided in section 1, shall be adjusted appropriately to restore to lilco its rights hereunder, including the right to purchase from the company (or its successors) shares of company common stock representing 19.9% of the outstanding company common stock for the aggregate exercise price calculated as of the date of this agreement as provided in section 1. 11. restrictive legends. each certificate representing shares of company common stock issued to lilco hereunder, and lilco shares, if any, delivered to the company at a closing, shall include a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement, dated as of december 29, 1996, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer upon request. it is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the securities act in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates(s) without such reference if lilco or the company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the other party a copy of a letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the other party, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the securities act; (ii) the reference to the provisions to this agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. in addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 10 shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in section 12. 12. binding effect; no assignment; no third party beneficiaries. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. except as expressly provided for in this agreement, neither this agreement nor the rights or the obligations of either party hereto are assignable, except by operation of law, or with the written consent of the other party. nothing contained in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted assigns any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever by reason of this agreement. any restricted shares sold by a party in compliance with the provisions of section 10 shall, upon consummation of such sale, be free of the restrictions imposed with respect to such shares by this agreement, unless and until such party shall -10 repurchase or otherwise become the beneficial owner of such shares, and any transferee of such shares shall not be entitled to the registration rights of such party. 13. specific performance. the parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this agreement. in the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is adequate remedy at law. 14. entire agreement. this agreement, the lilco stock option agreement, the confidentiality agreement and the exchange agreement (including the exhibits and schedules thereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 15. further assurances. each party will execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 16. validity. the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. in the event any court or other competent authority holds any provisions of this agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith the execution and delivery of an amendment to this agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision and the economic effects thereof. if for any reason any such court or regulatory agency determines that lilco is not permitted to acquire, or the company is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to section 7, the full number of shares of company common stock provided in section 1 hereof (as the same may be adjusted), it is the express intention of the company to allow lilco to acquire or to require the company to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof. each party agrees that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action inconsistent herewith,or not take any action required herein, the other party shall not be entitled to specific performance of such provision or part hereof or to any other remedy, including but not limited to money damages, for breach hereof or of any other provision of this agreement or part hereof as the result of such holding or order. -11 17. notices. all
