common stock" and, together with the class a preference stock, the "class a stock"), of the issuer representing in the aggregate approximately 20% of the voting power of the issuer after such purchase. under the circumstances and subject to the conditions described in more detail below, the shares of class a preference stock purchased by ft and dt and/or certain of their designated

stock are convertible into common stock. see, generally, the investment agreement attached hereto as exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the investment agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. purchase of class a preference stock at the first closing. on january 31, 1996, in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, which provides for a formula to determine the number, type and price of shares to be purchased, ft and dt purchased $3 billion in aggregate liquidation value (and a $47.225 per share liquidation value) of shares of class a preference stock on the initial issuance date because (i) the issuer's proposed spinoff of its cellular operations to the holders of common stock (the "cellular spin-off") was pending on such date and (ii) the average closing market price (the "first closing average sprint price") of a share of common stock for the 20 trading day period ended 15 trading days before the initial issuance date was greater than $38.963. pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement, the price (as adjusted from time to time, the "conversion price") at which a share of class a preference stock acquired by ft and dt converts into a share of class a common stock is, subject to adjustment as described below, $48.704. purchase of class a common stock at the deferred common stock closing. if (i) the cellular spin-off has occurred or has been abandoned, (ii) the conditions to the establishment of the conversion date (as defined below in "certain terms relating to the class a preference stock -- conversion into class a common stock") have been satisfied, and (iii) the shares of class a preference stock are to be converted on the conversion date, unless such conversion date has been deferred by ft and dt as described in the following paragraph, then ft and dt, subject to certain conditions, will purchase from the issuer additional shares of class a common stock equal to the excess of (i) 86,236,036 shares over (ii) the sum of (x) the number of shares of class a common stock issued upon the conversion of the outstanding shares of class a preference stock and (y) the number of shares of class a common stock that would have been issued in respect of shares of class a preference stock previously purchased but which have been transferred to persons other than the class a holders or which have been redeemed. the purchase price of each such additional share of class a common stock will be the conversion price at which shares of class a preference stock were converted into shares of common stock. unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the closing (the "deferred common stock closing") of such purchase will occur on the later of (i) the conversion date and (ii) the date on which all of the conditions precedent to such closing have been satisfied or waived. purchase of class a preference stock at the supplemental preference stock closing. as described below in "certain terms relating to the class a preference stock -- conversion into class a common stock"), ft and dt may elect to defer conversion of the class a preference stock in accordance with the articles of association of the issuer (as amended by the charter amendments (as defined in item 5) thereto filed in connection with the first closing, the "articles") if the conversion price is in excess of 135% of the average closing market price (the "average sprint price") of a share of common stock for the 20 consecutive trading day period ended on the 10th business day prior to the conversion date. if ft and dt elect to defer such conversion, then, subject to certain conditions, ft and dt will purchase from the issuer additional shares of class a preference stock having an aggregate liquidation value equal to the excess of (i) the product of 86,236,036 and the per share conversion price of the outstanding class a preference stock over (ii) the aggregate liquidation value of the shares of class a preference stock previously purchased. the purchase price of each such share will be equal to its liquidation value. unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the closing (the "supplemental preference stock closing") of such purchase will occur ten business days after the later of (i) the date on which the election to defer conversion pursuant to the articles is made and (ii) the date on which all of the conditions precedent to such closing have been satisfied or waived. purchase of optional shares. each of ft and dt will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the issuer additional shares (the "optional shares") of either (i) class a common stock, if the issuer has previously issued class a common stock (the date on which such class a common stock was first issued being referred to as the "class a common issuance date"), or (ii) class a preference stock, if the supplemental preference stock closing has occurred. the number of optional shares that each of ft and dt will be entitled to purchase at the closing for such shares (the "optional shares closing") generally will be equal to one-half of the number of shares of class a common stock equal to, or one-half of the number of additional shares of class a preference stock convertible into a number of additional shares of class a common stock equal to, 25% of the number of shares of common stock issued after june page 7 of 27 pages 14, 1994 and on or prior to the date of the supplemental preference stock closing or the class a common issuance date, whichever first occurs (the "investment completion date"). shares of class a preference stock purchased at the optional shares closing will have a per share liquidation value equal to their per share purchase price and, upon the issuance of such shares at the optional shares closing, the conversion price will be adjusted as described below in "certain terms relating to the class a preference stock --conversion into class a common stock." with respect to shares of common stock issued after june 14, 1994 and on or prior to the investment completion date, other than (subject to certain exceptions) those shares of common stock issued in respect of stock options, warrants or other rights in existence on or before the initial issuance date or upon the conversion of any securities outstanding on or before the initial issuance date, the purchase price of the optional shares will be based on the weighted average per unit price paid for such common stock. with respect to shares of common stock issued after june 14, 1994 and on or prior to the investment completion date in respect of stock options, warrants or other rights in existence on or before the initial issuance date or upon the conversion of any securities outstanding on or before the initial issuance date, the purchase price of the optional shares will be based on the higher of (i) the per share price at which class a common stock was issued and sold to ft and dt at the class a common issuance date or at which class a preference stock was issued at the supplemental preference stock closing and (ii) the weighted average price paid for such common stock. adjustments. the number of shares of class a stock to be purchased by ft and dt and the purchase price for such shares will be adjusted to reflect any stock split, subdivision, stock dividend or other reclassification, consolidation or combination of the voting securities of the issuer or similar action or transaction occurring between june 14, 1994 and the investment completion date. no such adjustment will be made in respect of the cellular spin-off. in addition, the number of shares of class a stock to be purchased by ft and dt will be reduced by the minimum number of shares, if any, necessary to ensure that after the investment completion date ft and dt will own in the aggregate no more than 20% of the sum of (i) the outstanding voting power of the issuer and (ii) the voting power of the issuer which ft and dt have committed to purchase. effect of conversion. if after the initial issuance date the fundamental rights (as defined below in "--conversion of class a common stock; termination of fundamental rights") shall have terminated as to all outstanding shares of class a preference stock, or all outstanding shares of class a common stock shall have converted into common stock, shares of class a stock to have been issued by the issuer shall instead be issued as common stock. terms of class a stock in general the charter amendments establish the terms of the class a stock, including voting rights, and also supplement the terms of the common stock in order to set forth the rights of the holders of the common stock in relation to those of the holders of the class a stock. see, generally, the charter amendments attached hereto as exhibit 8 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the charter amendments contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. the terms of the class a common stock generally will be equivalent on a per share basis to the terms of the common stock except for special voting and other rights of the class a common stock described below. the terms of the class a preference stock generally will be identical to the terms of the class a common stock with respect to rights to representation on the issuer's board of directors (the "board") and disapproval rights, but will differ from the class a common stock in other respects, such as the right to receive dividends and liquidation rights, voting rights and protection from dilution. page 8 of 27 pages certain terms relating to the class a preference stock dividends. the holders of shares of class a preference stock, in preference to the holders of common stock and of any other outstanding junior capital stock, but after payment of dividends to holders of shares of all series of preferred stock of the issuer (the "preferred stock") that are not specifically made junior to or made to rank on a parity with the class a preference stock in the payment of dividends, shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the board, quarterly dividends in an amount per share equal to: (i) until the investment completion date, the aggregate per share amount of all dividends and distributions declared on the common stock since the immediately preceding dividend payment date for the class a preference stock (other than extraordinary dividends and distributions), multiplied by $47.225 and divided by the conversion price at the time in effect, and (ii) from and after the investment completion date, the aggregate per share amount of dividends declared on the common stock since the immediately preceding dividend payment date for the class a preference stock (or, with respect to the first dividend payment date after the investment completion date, since the investment completion date) multiplied by the aggregate amount paid by the class a holders for all outstanding shares of class a preference stock, including any shares of class a preference stock converted from any other form of the issuer's capital stock, divided by the number of shares of class a preference stock outstanding (such aggregate amount paid divided by the number of shares outstanding being referred to herein as the "liquidation preference") and divided by the conversion price at the time in effect. the charter amendments set forth details relating to the priority in payment of dividends on the class a preference stock and the consequences of the issuer's failure to pay such dividends in a timely manner. liquidation rights. in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the issuer, the holders of any series of preferred stock which has not been specifically made to rank junior or on a parity with class a preference stock in the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the issuer will be entitled to receive their liquidation preferences before any distributions are made to the holders of the class a preference stock. no distribution may be made to the holders of shares of capital stock junior to the class a preference stock until the holders of the class a preference stock, other than shares of class a preference stock acquired by the class a holders upon conversion of shares of common stock pursuant to the articles (the "converted preference stock"), have received the liquidation preference per share of class a preference stock. the converted preference stock shall, immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, automatically convert back into the number of shares of common stock which were converted into converted preference stock pursuant to the articles. voting rights. except as may otherwise be required by law, and except in connection with the election of directors and the exercise of certain disapproval rights, the shares of class a preference stock will be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of class a common stock into which the then outstanding shares of class a preference stock would, at the time of determination, be convertible. anti-dilution provisions. the articles provide for protection of the holders of the class a preference stock against dilution relating to stock splits, mergers, exchanges and certain other dilutive transactions. conversion into class a common stock. shares of class a preference stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock as described below. timing of conversion. shares of class a preference stock will automatically convert into class a common stock (or into common stock if the fundamental rights shall have terminated as to all outstanding shares of class a preference stock) at the conversion price on the date (the "conversion date") which is the earliest of (x) 35 trading days after the occurrence of the cellular spin-off, (y) 30 days after the abandonment of the cellular spin-off and (z) 60 days after the fifth anniversary of the initial issuance date. notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the cellular spin-off occurs shares of class a preference stock otherwise would be converted at a conversion price equal to or greater than 135% page 9 of 27 pages of the average sprint price for the 20 trading days ended on the 10th business day prior to the conversion date, the class a holders may elect to defer the conversion until the first business day following the 30th business day after the occurrence of a period of 20 trading days in which the conversion price is not more than 135% of the average sprint price over such period or until the class a holders otherwise elect to convert at the conversion price. re-fixing of conversion price. effective on the date of the cellular spin- off, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the cellular spin-off will automatically be re-fixed by deducting from such conversion price an amount equal to the product of (i) the quotient of $48.704 divided by the average sprint price used in calculating such conversion price, multiplied by (ii) a base factor (the "cellular spin-off reduction factor") used to reflect the reduction in value of the issuer due to the cellular spin-off. the cellular spin-off reduction factor depends upon the average closing price of the common stock of the spun-off entity ("spinco") for the 20 trading days following the cellular spin-off, as adjusted to reflect the number of outstanding shares of spinco common stock relative to the number of outstanding shares of common stock (the "adjusted cellular price"). in general, if the adjusted cellular price is between $3.25 and $7.25, the cellular spin-off reduction factor will be $5.25; if the adjusted cellular price is lower than $3.25, the cellular spin-off reduction factor will be below $5.25; and if the adjusted cellular price is higher than $7.25, the cellular spin-off reduction factor will be higher than $5.25. the cellular spin-off reduction factor and the ranges used to calculate such factor will be adjusted to reflect (i) the level of indebtedness to be borne by spinco to the extent it differs from the $2.955 per share specified in the investment agreement, and (ii) the purchase and sale prices of any acquisitions and dispositions effected by the issuer's cellular and wireless division prior to the cellular spin-off. the conversion price will also be adjusted to reflect the purchase price of any additional shares of class a preference stock acquired by ft and dt (i) at an optional shares closing, (ii) pursuant to their equity purchase rights under the stockholders' agreement (as defined in item 5) or (iii) pursuant to the automatic conversion of common stock into class a stock under the articles. conversion following certain rights plan events. upon the occurrence of certain events under the rights plan, dated august 8, 1989, as amended (the "rights plan") of the issuer, each share of class a preference stock will convert into shares of class a common stock at a conversion price of $47.225. see also "conversion of class a common stock; termination of fundamental rights." certain terms relating to the class a common stock dividends. subject to exceptions set forth in the articles, the holders of shares of class a common stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board, dividends on the shares of class a common stock in an amount per share equal to the per share amount of any dividend on the common stock. liquidation rights. in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the issuer, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the issuer, including the liquidation preferences of any existing series of preferred or preference stock of the issuer then outstanding, the holders of the class a common stock and the holders of the common stock will share ratably in any remaining assets of the issuer. voting rights. except as may otherwise be required by law, and except in connection with the election of directors and the exercise of certain disapproval rights, each share of class a common stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter in respect of which the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to vote, and the holders of shares of class a common stock will vote together as a single class with the holders of shares of the common stock and all other classes or series of capital stock of the issuer which have general voting power. no holder of capital stock of the issuer, including the class a holders, is entitled to cumulative voting of his or her shares of capital stock in the election of any members of the board. with respect to certain breaches of the standstill agreement (as defined in item 5), ft and/or dt will not be entitled to vote any of their shares of capital stock of the issuer with respect to the matter arising from or relating to such breach. page 10 of 27 pages anti-dilution provisions. the issuer may not effect any reclassification, subdivision or combination of the outstanding class a common stock unless at the same time the common stock is reclassified, subdivided or combined so that the holders of the common stock remain entitled, in the aggregate, to voting power of the issuer representing the same percentage relative to the class a common stock as was represented by the common stock prior to such reclassification, subdivision or combination. holders of class a common stock have identical anti-dilution protection if such modifications are made to the common stock. in connection with such a reclassification, subdivision or combination of common stock, the issuer would also be required to maintain all of the rights provided to the class a holders in the articles. in addition, in the case of any consolidation or merger of the issuer with or into any other entity (other than a merger or consolidation which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of the common stock) or any other reclassification of the common stock into any other form of capital stock of the issuer, each holder of class a common stock will have the right to convert each share of class a common stock held by it into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property which such class a holder would have been entitled to receive in such merger, consolidation or reclassification had such class a holder converted its shares of class a common stock into common stock immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or reclassification. associated rights. each share of class a common stock will have attached one- half of a right issued pursuant to the rights plan. certain terms relating to all class a stock board representation rights as and from the initial issuance date, the class a holders have the right to representation on the board equal to the percentage of the issuer's voting power owned by the class a holders, rounded up or down to the nearer whole number of directors. on the initial issuance date, ft and dt exercised such right and elected mr. michel bon and dr. ron sommer to the board. in addition, for so long as it is necessary in order to allow ft and dt to receive certain benefits under tax treaties between the united states and france and between the united states and germany, respectively, the class a holders will be entitled to elect not less than 20% of the members of the board at any time when their actual percentage of the issuer's voting power is at least 20%. moreover, the class a holders will be entitled to elect a minimum of two directors so long as the percentage of voting securities of the issuer owned by them, plus the percentage they are committed to purchase (collectively, and determined on a basis that includes as outstanding the shares they are committed to purchase, the "committed percentage"), does not fall below 10% due to transfers or, if the committed percentage is below 10% for 180 consecutive days following a major issuance, until the later of (i) three years after the consummation of such major issuance and (ii) the investment completion date. in addition, until the investment completion date, so long as the aggregate liquidation value of the outstanding class a preference stock is at least $1.5 billion (or a lesser amount resulting from a purchase by the issuer of shares of class a preference stock pursuant to the stockholders' agreement in order for the issuer to comply with section 310 of the communications act of 1934, as amended (the "communications act")), the class a holders will be entitled to elect a minimum of two directors to the board. unless prohibited by law or the rules of the new york stock exchange (the "nyse"), the class a holders will be entitled to one representative on each committee of the board. after examining the relevant circumstances, the nyse has indicated that it would be opposed to the class a holders having a representative on the audit committee of the board. the articles provide that any class a director may be removed from office with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of class a stock voting separately as a class or with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer voting as a single class. disapproval rights page 11 of 27 pages pursuant to the terms of the class a stock, the class a holders will have the right for specified periods of time to disapprove the taking of certain actions by the issuer. these rights will include the right to disapprove certain business transactions of the issuer, issuances of 30% or more of the issuer's voting power (a "major issuance") and certain transactions involving major competitors of ft/dt (as such term is defined under "major competitors" below). certain business transactions. the class a holders will have the right to disapprove the following actions by the issuer until the second anniversary of the initial issuance date (through action by the holders of a majority of the shares of class a stock): (i) other than certain exempt transactions defined in the articles as "exempt asset divestitures" and "exempt long distance asset divestitures", any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in divestitures of assets with a fair market value in excess of 20% of the issuer's market capitalization as of the date of the definitive agreement relating to the last such divestiture; (ii) other than exempt asset divestitures and exempt long distance asset divestitures, any transaction or series of related transactions (including a merger or other business combination) resulting in the acquisition for cash or debt securities having a maturity of less than one year of: (a) businesses defined in the articles as "core businesses", the purchase price of which exceeds 20% of the issuer's market capitalization immediately prior to such acquisition; or (b) businesses other than core businesses, the purchase price of which exceeds 5% of the issuer's market capitalization immediately prior to such acquisition, provided that if an acquisition involves both core businesses and other businesses and the ratio of the fair market value of the core businesses to be acquired to the fair market value of the other businesses to be acquired exceeds 1.75 to 1, then the class a holders will only be entitled to disapproval rights as set forth in clause (ii)(a) above; (iii) the issuance by the issuer of any capital stock or debt with class voting rights and certain disapproval rights which are in scope and duration as extensive as or more extensive than the rights granted to the class a holders; (iv) the declaration of extraordinary cash dividends or cash distributions to stockholders of the issuer during any one year in excess of 5% of the market capitalization of the issuer (if the investment completion date has not occurred by the end of such two-year period, the class a holders will continue to have the right to disapprove such dividends or distributions until the occurrence of the investment completion date); (v) any merger or other business combination in which the issuer is not the surviving parent corporation; and (vi) any major issuance. beginning two years after the initial issuance date, the issuer may take any of the foregoing actions despite the disapproval of such action by ft and dt. however, if despite such disapproval the issuer nevertheless takes any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (vi) above following the second anniversary, but prior to the fifth anniversary, of the initial issuance date, the transfer restrictions described below applicable to the class a stock (other than those restrictions relating to transfers to a holder of more than 5% of the issuer's voting power) will terminate, unless in the case of a major issuance the class a holders have exercised their equity purchase rights in respect of such major issuance. page 12 of 27 pages in addition, during the five-year period following the initial issuance date, a major issuance will require the approval of two-thirds of the independent directors (as defined in the articles), and after such five-year period will require the approval of a majority of the independent directors as long as any shares of class a stock are outstanding. governing documents, etc. the class a holders will have the right to disapprove the following actions until no shares of class a stock are outstanding: (i) amendments to the articles, the bylaws of the issuer (as amended by the bylaws amendments (defined in item 5) the "bylaws") or the rights plan that would adversely affect the rights of the class a holders under the articles or the bylaws; (ii) issuance by the issuer of any capital stock or debt (including pursuant to a merger or other business combination) with more than one vote per share or otherwise having supervoting powers; (iii) any merger or other business combination involving the issuer that results in a change of control (as defined below in "-- change of control rights"), unless the surviving corporation expressly (x) assumes all of the issuer's obligations to the class a holders with respect to the assets defined in the articles as "long distance assets" and all of the provisions of the registration rights agreement (as defined in item 5) and (y) agrees to be bound by the rights of ft, dt and their affiliates to exercise greater control over the joint venture (as defined in item 6) following certain occurrences; (iv) any merger or other business combination involving the issuer that does not result in a change of control, unless (x) the issuer survives as the parent entity, or (y) the surviving corporation expressly assumes all of the issuer's obligations in respect of the rights of the class a holders granted pursuant to the articles, the bylaws, the stockholders' agreement and the registration rights agreement; and (v) for so long as any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the issuance by the issuer of shares of preferred stock which have rights to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuer senior to such rights of the class a preference stock. long distance assets. until the earliest of (i) the fifth anniversary of the initial issuance date, (ii) the date on which the ownership by ft and dt of the long distance assets is no longer prohibited by section 310 of the communications act, (iii) the date on which the ft/dt parties elect to accept the issuer's offer to sell all of the interests (the "venture interests") of the issuer and certain of its affiliates (the "sprint parties") in the companies comprising the joint venture (the "jv entities") following a change of control, and (iv) the date on which the sprint parties exercise their right to sell all of the venture interests to the ft/dt parties following a change of control (such period, the "initial period"), no sale of a cumulative amount of 5% or more of the fair market value of long distance assets, other than exempt long distance asset divestitures, may be consummated by the issuer if it is disapproved by the class a holders. as used herein, the term "cumulative" means a percentage representing the aggregate fair market value of all long distance assets previously sold or proposed to be sold in the transaction for which such calculation is being made, divided by the fair market value of long distance assets existing on the date of the definitive agreement with respect to such transaction. major competitors. during the ten-year period following the initial issuance date, the issuer may not consummate any transaction or take any other action that would result in, or is taken for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a major competitor of ft/dt (as defined in the articles) having, or being granted by the issuer, any right, permission or approval to acquire, 10% or more of the outstanding voting power of the issuer if such transaction or action is disapproved by the class a holders, unless such transaction is a strategic merger (as defined in the articles). major competitor rights until the tenth anniversary of the initial issuance date, if a major competitor of ft/dt obtains securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding voting power of the issuer as the result of a strategic merger, the class a page 13 of 27 pages holders will have the right to commit within 30 days after the latter of the consummation of such strategic merger and the initial issuance date, to purchase from the issuer or its successor in the strategic merger, and the issuer or such successor will be obligated to sell to the class a holders after the investment completion date, a number of shares of class a stock such that the aggregate percentage ownership of the class a holders shall be equal to the percentage ownership interest of such major competitor following the consummation of such strategic merger. if the class a holders do not so elect, (i) the issuer will take all actions necessary to lift all restrictions imposed by the issuer on the ability of the class a holders to purchase shares from third parties, (ii) the issuer will be obligated to ensure that the class a holders will have rights (other than rights deriving solely from the number of shares of voting securities of the issuer owned) in scope and duration at least as extensive as certain rights granted by the issuer to such major competitor, regardless of whether the class a holders exercise their right to increase their ownership, and (iii) if such major competitor has been granted rights by the issuer equivalent or superior to the board representation rights of the class a holders, the disapproval rights of the class a holders, the rights with respect to major competitors of ft/dt, the right of first offer with respect to long distance assets, the equity purchase rights of the class a holders, and the protections provided to the class a holders in the event of a change of control or an exclusionary tender offer (collectively, the "minority rights") of the class a holders, then for a period of five years following the date of closing of such transaction ft, dt, atlas or any qualifying subsidiary of ft, dt or atlas which owns interests in the jv entities (collectively the "ft/dt parties") will obtain rights which will give them greater control over the joint venture. change of control rights if the issuer determines to effect an acquisition proposal (as defined below in this paragraph), the issuer will conduct such transaction in accordance with reasonable procedures to be determined by the board and permit ft and dt to participate in that process on a basis no less favorable than that granted any other participant. in general, this provision is designed to permit ft and dt to participate as a bidder in such transaction on an equal basis with all other bidders seeking to acquire control of the issuer. in addition, if the board determines to effect a transaction involving a change of control, the standstill provisions applicable to ft and dt pursuant to the standstill agreement will terminate. if a change of control occurs, the class a holders will not be obligated to proceed with any additional purchases of class a stock which would have been required under the investment agreement. finally, in the case of a change of control, the ft/dt parties will obtain rights which will give them greater control over the joint venture, provided that if, at any time following such change of control, the sprint parties offer to sell all of their venture interests to the ft/dt parties at a price equal to the appraised value thereof, and the ft/dt parties decline such offer, then, at such time, such rights will terminate. during the two year period beginning on the fifth anniversary of the consummation of a change of control, the sprint parties will have the right to require the ft/dt parties to purchase all of the venture interests of the sprint parties at the appraised value thereof. if the ft/dt parties accept such offer or such right is exercised by the sprint parties, the disapproval rights of the class a holders with respect to the long distance assets of the issuer will terminate. as used herein, an "acquisition proposal" means a determination by the issuer to sell all or substantially all of its assets or not to oppose a third-party tender, exchange or other purchase offer for more than 35% of the voting power of the issuer or to sell control of the issuer or to effect a merger or other business combination, the result of which would be a 35% or larger stockholder (other than ft, dt and those majority-owned subsidiaries of ft and/or dt which satisfy certain criteria ("qualified subsidiaries")) in the resulting entity. a "change of control" means: (i) a decision by the board to sell control of the issuer or not to oppose a third party tender offer for the issuer's voting securities representing more than 35% of the voting power of the issuer, or (ii) a change in the identity of the majority of the board due to (x) a proxy contest (or the threat to engage in a proxy contest) or the election of directors by the holders of preferred stock, or (y) any unsolicited tender, exchange or other purchase offer which has not been approved by a majority of the independent directors, page 14 of 27 pages except that neither a strategic merger nor any transaction between the issuer and ft and/or dt shall be deemed to be a change of control. exclusionary tender offer rights in addition to the rights of the class a holders upon a change of control, if the board determines not to oppose a tender offer by a person other than ft, dt or their respective affiliates for 35% or more of the issuer voting power which does not permit the class a holders to sell an equal or greater percentage of their shares as the other holders of the voting securities of the issuer are permitted to sell (an "exclusionary tender offer"), the class a holders will have the right (but not the obligation) to cause the conversion into common stock of all or part of the shares of class a stock held by them. upon such election, each share of class a common stock so designated will automatically convert into one duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock and each share of class a preference stock will automatically convert into, generally, a number of shares of common stock equivalent to the number of shares of class a common stock into which it would be convertible. in the event of an exclusionary tender offer in which the class a holders do not elect to convert their shares of class a stock into common stock as described above, upon the completion of the purchase by a third party of securities representing not less than 35% of the issuer's voting power in such exclusionary tender offer, the class a holders will have the option to require the issuer to purchase at the tender offer price all, but not less than all, of the shares that they were unable to tender on the same basis as the other stockholders, unless under the terms of the tender offer such class a holders are entitled to receive publicly traded securities and/or cash in an equivalent amount in a business combination transaction required to be effected within 90 days after the consummation of the tender offer. equity purchase rights the stockholders' agreement provides that, following the investment completion date and for so long as the committed percentage of the class a holders is not less than 10% for more than a specified period and unless such right is otherwise terminated, when the issuer issues additional shares of common stock or other voting securities each of the class a holders will have the right, subject to certain restrictions, to maintain its proportionate ownership of the issuer's voting power (based on such class a holder's committed percentage) by purchasing additional shares of class a stock from the issuer. see, generally, the stockholders' agreement attached hereto as exhibit 7 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the stockholders' agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. the purchase price for such shares will depend upon the nature of the issuance which gives rise to such purchase right, as provided in the stockholders' agreement. major issuance rights the stockholders' agreement provides that, if the committed percentage of the class a holders is diluted to less than 10% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer as a result of a major issuance, the class a holders will be entitled, in addition to any equity purchase rights referred to above entitling them to purchase shares from the issuer to increase their ownership of the outstanding voting power of the issuer, during the three-year period following the consummation of such major issuance to increase their committed percentage to 10% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer if within 180 days after such major issuance (or, if class a preference stock is outstanding and if the initial issuance date has not yet occurred, within 180 days of the initial issuance date), the class a holders commit to the issuer to increase their interest to 10% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer through purchases from third parties. long distance assets rights the stockholders' agreement provides that, following the initial period and prior to the tenth anniversary of the initial issuance date, with certain exceptions, if a disposition of long distance assets by the issuer would result in the disposition of a cumulative amount of 30% or more of the fair market value of long distance assets since the date of page 15 of 27 pages the investment agreement, the class a holders will have a right of first offer with respect to the assets of which the issuer proposes to dispose, unless such right of first offer has been otherwise terminated. in connection with such a disposition, for so long as the restrictions contained in section 310 of the communications act apply, ft and dt will have the right to assign their right to purchase such long distance assets to a buyer (a "qualified ld purchaser") having the legal and financial capacity to buy such assets which would not be a major competitor of sprint (as defined below in "conversion of class a common stock; termination of fundamental rights -- conversion following breach of joint venture agreement") based on the business of the issuer following such disposition. upon learning the identity of the prospective qualified ld purchaser proposed by ft and dt, the issuer will be entitled to abandon the disposition which gave rise to such right in ft and dt. registration rights the class a holders have been granted certain registration rights by the issuer pursuant to the registration rights agreement. see, generally, the registration rights agreement attached hereto as exhibit 3 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the registration rights agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. the holders of a majority of the class a stock will be entitled to demand one registration in any 12-month period, up to a maximum of seven registrations. the issuer will be responsible for the registration expenses in connection with the first five of such registrations; the holders of the class a stock requesting registration will be responsible for the registration expenses in connection with the remaining two registrations. the issuer is not required to effect any registration unless the market value of the class a stock requested to be registered exceeds $200 million. the holders of the class a stock will also have the right to participate in all registrations of common stock by the issuer on behalf of itself or any other party, other than registrations on forms s-4 or s-8, registrations in connection with an exchange offer or offerings solely to the issuer's existing stockholders or pursuant to dividend reinvestment plans or dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. transfer restrictions pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, the class a holders have agreed not to transfer any equity interests in the issuer until the fifth anniversary of the initial issuance date, except for transfers to ft, dt, qualified subsidiaries, and in certain circumstances, qualified stock purchasers (such permitted transfers being "section 2.2 transfers"). after the general prohibition on transfers is no longer applicable, until such time as the sum of (i) the committed percentage of the class a holders and (ii) the percentage of the voting power of the issuer represented by voting securities of the issuer which the class a holders have the right to commit to purchase pursuant to the investment agreement and the stockholders' agreement is less than 3 1/2% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer for more than 150 days, no class a holder may make any transfer to, or resulting in, a holder of more than 5% of the voting power of the issuer, other than in an underwritten public offering. in connection with any such public offering, a class a holder may not to the best of its knowledge (i) sell more than 2% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer to any person or group that, prior to such sale, owned 3% or more of such voting power of the issuer, (ii) sell more than 5% of the outstanding voting power of the issuer to any person or group or (iii) sell to a person or group required under section 13(d) of the exchange act to file a schedule 13d with respect to the issuer (a "schedule 13d filer") or to a person or group who, as a result of such sale, would become a schedule 13d filer. so long as the sum of (i) the committed percentage of the class a holders and (ii) the percentage of the voting power of the issuer which the class a holders have the right to commit to purchase pursuant to the investment agreement and the stockholders' agreement is greater than 5%, but less than 9% (immediately following a transfer of shares of class a stock by the class a holders) or 10% (for more than 150 days immediately following the issuance of additional voting securities of the issuer other than pursuant to a major issuance), no class a holder may transfer shares of class a stock representing more than 1% of the voting power of the issuer to any one person or group of persons in any transaction or series of transactions, except in connection with a public offering, or transfer shares other than in a public offering to any "major competitor of sprint." page 16 of 27 pages each proposed sale by the class a holders of equity securities of the issuer to a third party, other than section 2.2 transfers, will be subject to the rights of first offer and first refusal specified in the stockholders' agreement. in the event of a change of control resulting from a determination by the board to sell all or substantially all of the assets of the issuer (or not to oppose a third-party tender offer for more than 35% of the issuer's voting power) or to sell control of the issuer or to effect a merger or other business combination, the result of which is a 35% or larger stockholder (other than ft, dt or any of their qualified subsidiaries) in the resulting entity the class a holders generally will have the right to sell their shares of class a stock in such transaction free of any restriction on transfer (except for transfers to large holders) set forth in the stockholders' agreement. the transfer restrictions (other than those relating to transfers to large holders) and the rights of first offer and first refusal will terminate (i) if the joint venture is terminated due to a material breach by the issuer, (ii) on the first anniversary of a termination of the joint venture for any reason other than a material breach by the issuer or the ft/dt parties, (iii) if the issuer breaches certain material provisions of the investment agreement or the related documents, (iv) if the issuer proceeds with a transaction involving an acquisition proposal, (v) if the class a holders own shares (a) representing less than 10% of the outstanding common stock and the class a common stock for 150 days due to share issuances by the issuer (other than a major issuance), or (b) representing less than 9% of the outstanding common stock and the class a common stock due to sales by the class a holders (provided that the issuer's right of first offer shall continue until the class a holders own or are committed to acquire or have the right to commit to acquire less than 5% of the voting power of the issuer), (vi) if the class a holders own shares representing less than 10% of the outstanding common stock and class a common stock as a result of a major issuance and the class a holders fail to exercise their right to purchase additional class a common stock in connection therewith, (vii) if there is a greater than 20% holder of voting securities of the issuer (other than the class a holders) or there is a change of control, or (viii) if the issuer undertakes certain transactions between the second and fifth anniversaries of the initial issuance date notwithstanding the disapproval of ft and dt (other than with respect to a major issuance following which the class a holders exercise their equity purchase rights with respect thereto). standstill restrictions as a condition to entering into the investment agreement, ft, dt and the issuer have entered into the standstill agreement. see, generally, the standstill agreement attached hereto as exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the standstill agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. the standstill agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of ft and dt and their respective "affiliates" and "associates" (as defined in the standstill agreement) to acquire additional voting power in the issuer that would result in ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates beneficially owning more than 20% of the issuer's voting power during the first fifteen years following the date of the standstill agreement (the "initial percentage limitation") and more than the lesser of (i) 30% of the issuer's voting power and (ii) that percentage of the issuer's outstanding voting securities equal to 80% of the foreign ownership limitation (as defined below) (the "subsequent percentage limitation," and together with the initial percentage limitation, the "percentage limitations"). for purposes of the standstill agreement, the "foreign ownership limitation" means the maximum aggregate percentage of the issuer's voting securities that may be owned of record or voted by aliens under section 310(b)(4) of the communications act, without such ownership or voting resulting in the possible loss, or possible failure to secure the renewal or reinstatement, of any license or franchise of any governmental authority held by the issuer or any of its affiliates to conduct any portion of the business of the issuer or such affiliate, as such maximum aggregate percentage may be increased from time to time by amendments to section 310 or by actions of the fcc. in addition, the standstill agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates to initiate or participate in proposals with respect to the control of the issuer. the term "associate" in the standstill agreement generally has the meaning ascribed to such term in rule 12b-2 under the exchange act, except that such definition has been limited with respect to the "associates" of ft and dt for purposes of the standstill agreement. under the standstill agreement, ft and dt and their respective affiliates generally will be permitted, subject to the rights plan, to increase their beneficial ownership beyond the applicable percentage limitation to the extent page 17 of 27 pages required to match the percentage ownership of voting securities of the issuer owned by any other shareholder, provided that the beneficial ownership of ft and dt and their respective affiliates does not exceed 80% of the foreign ownership limitation. in addition, neither ft nor dt shall be deemed in violation of the beneficial ownership restriction if the beneficial ownership of the issuer's voting securities by ft and dt exceeds the applicable percentage limitation solely due to (i) an acquisition of the issuer's voting securities by the issuer, unless ft and dt have previously been notified of such acquisition, or (ii) purchases by ft and dt of voting securities of the issuer in reliance on information regarding the number of outstanding voting securities of the issuer provided by the issuer to ft and dt, unless ft and dt have previously been notified that such information is incorrect. if an acquisition by ft or dt or their respective affiliates and associates of beneficial ownership of additional voting securities of the issuer otherwise permitted by the standstill agreement is prohibited because it would result in ft or dt and their respective affiliates and associates beneficially owning a percentage of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer greater than that percentage equal to 80% of the foreign ownership limitation, then in accordance with the terms of the stockholders' agreement, ft and dt may assign their rights to purchase the additional shares of voting securities of the issuer they would otherwise be entitled to purchase under the standstill agreement to an entity that ft and dt reasonably believe has the legal and financial ability to purchase such shares and that would not be an alien or a major competitor of sprint immediately following such purchase (a "qualified stock purchaser"). the standstill agreement provides a number of other restrictions on the actions or public announcements which may be undertaken or made by ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates. ft and dt have agreed to cause (i) their qualified subsidiaries which acquire shares of class a stock, (ii) each person other than ft, dt or a passive financial institution which acquires an equity interest in a qualified subsidiary (each, a "strategic investor"), and (iii) each qualified stock purchaser which acquires any shares of class a stock, in each case to execute a standstill agreement prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such acquisition. redemptions outstanding shares of common stock held by aliens (as defined in the communications act) and, in certain circumstances, class a stock held by aliens may be redeemed at prices provided in the articles by action of the board to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the board, to comply with section 310 of the communications act. shares of class a stock may be redeemed only if, and only to the extent that, the outstanding shares of class a stock represent votes constituting greater than 20% of the aggregate voting power of the issuer immediately prior to the time of such redemption. in addition, prior to redeeming shares of class a stock, the issuer is required to consult in good faith with the class a holders to consider alternatives to redemption, and the issuer may not redeem such shares unless the independent directors determine in good faith that, after considering all reasonable alternatives, the failure to redeem such shares would have a material adverse effect on the issuer. for so long as the class a preference stock is outstanding, the issuer is not authorized to redeem shares of class a preference stock to the extent such redemption would result in the class a holders owning shares of class a preference stock with an aggregate liquidation value of less than $1.5 billion. however, to the extent the class a preference stock represents more than 20% of the issuer's voting power, the issuer may require the class a holders to sell to the issuer such number of shares of class a preference stock as in the reasonable good faith judgment of the board is necessary to comply with the requirements of section 310 of the communications act, even if such sale would result in the class a preference stock having an aggregate liquidation value of less than $1.5 billion. conversion of class a common stock; termination of fundamental rights as discussed below, under certain circumstances, shares of class a common stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock, or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the rights of the holders of the class a preference stock to elect directors and exercise disapproval rights and the right of ft and dt to participate in a proposed change of control (the "fundamental rights") associated with such class a preference stock will terminate. page 18 of 27 pages conversion following reduction in ownership. if, after the investment completion date, the aggregate committed percentage of the class a holders is below 10% for more than 180 consecutive days other than due to sales by the class a holders, each outstanding share of class a common stock will automatically convert into one share of common stock or, if shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will terminate, unless the committed percentage falls below 10% for more than 180 consecutive days due to a major issuance, in which case the class a common stock will not convert or the fundamental rights will not terminate, as the case may be, until the later of (i) three years after the consummation of such major issuance and (ii) the investment completion date. if after the investment completion date the committed percentage falls below 10% due to a sale by the class a holders, each outstanding share of class a common stock will automatically and immediately convert into one share of common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will immediately terminate. moreover, if prior to the investment completion date the class a holders own in the aggregate less than $1.5 billion of class a preference stock due to a transfer of such class a preference stock by the class a holders (other than a transfer required by the issuer to comply with section 310 of the communications act), the fundamental rights will terminate. conversion following breach of certain related investment documents. except as described below, each outstanding share of class a common stock will, following certain procedural steps, convert into one share of common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will terminate, if (i) ft, dt or any qualified subsidiary breaches in any material respect its obligations with respect to transfers of class a stock to large stockholders, (ii) ft, dt or any qualified subsidiary breaches in any material respect any other restriction on the transfer of class a stock or (iii) ft, dt or any qualified subsidiary breaches its obligations under certain specified provisions of the standstill agreement or under any standstill agreement into which such qualified subsidiary has entered (a "qualified subsidiary standstill agreement"), as the case may be, subject to certain procedures. conversion following failure to purchase class a stock. the fundamental rights associated with any outstanding class a preference stock will terminate if any class a holder fails to purchase class a stock at any closing at which it is required to effect such a purchase. conversion following breach of the joint venture agreement. except as described below, each outstanding share of class a common stock will automatically convert into one share of common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will immediately terminate, if (i) the sprint parties receive the right to control the management of the joint venture as a result of the sale by atlas of all or a substantial part of its telecommunications assets used to provide services to the joint venture to a major competitor of sprint or as a result of certain breaches of the joint venture agreement or the related joint venture documents or (ii) the joint venture is terminated due to certain actions by the ft/dt parties. a "major competitor of sprint" is defined generally as a company which materially competes with a major portion of the telecommunications services business of the issuer in north america or the business of the joint venture or a company which has taken substantial steps to become such a major competitor. if the joint venture is terminated due to certain actions on the part of the sprint parties or if the ft/dt parties receive the right to control the management of the joint venture due to certain breaches of the joint venture agreement by the sprint parties, each share of class a common stock outstanding will automatically convert into one share of common stock on the third anniversary of such termination or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will terminate on such third anniversary. if the joint venture is terminated for reasons other than those described in the preceding paragraph or the preceding sentence, (i) on the date of such termination the minority rights of the class a holders, other than rights to representation on the board and with respect to certain matters relating to the governing documents and related matters of the issuer, will immediately terminate and (ii) on the third anniversary of such termination of the joint venture, each share of class a common stock outstanding will automatically convert into one share of common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, all of the remaining fundamental rights will terminate. conversion following change of control. upon the occurrence of a change of control (other than a change of control arising from a change in the identity of a majority of the board due to (i) a proxy contest, (ii) the election of page 19 of 27 pages directors by the holders of the preferred stock, or (iii) an unauthorized tender offer not approved by a majority of the independent directors), the minority rights, except for rights as to long distance assets and rights to participate in a change of control, will terminate. the issuer is obligated in such a situation to negotiate in good faith with any potential acquiror of control to provide the class a holders with rights equivalent to the rights of the class a holders to representation on the board. upon such change of control, the class a holders will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the conversion of their class a stock into common stock. conversion following failure to maintain ownership ratios. if the ratio of the number of shares of class a stock held either of ft or dt and its qualified subsidiaries to the number held by the other of ft or dt and its qualified subsidiaries exceeds 50/50 prior to the investment completion date for more than 60 days after notice from the issuer to ft and dt, each share of class a common stock outstanding will automatically convert into one share of common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are outstanding, the fundamental rights will terminate. following the investment completion date, such ratio may not exceed 60/40. conversion following transfers to persons other than ft, dt, a qualified subsidiary or a qualified stock purchaser. if any shares of class a stock are transferred (other than pursuant to a transfer to ft, dt, a qualified subsidiary or a qualified stock purchaser in accordance with the stockholder's agreement) without the approval of the issuer, the shares of class a stock so transferred will automatically convert into shares of common stock. conversion following actions by qualified stock purchasers. if a qualified stock purchaser becomes a major competitor of the issuer, the shares of class a common stock owned by such qualified stock purchaser will immediately convert into common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are owned by such qualified stock purchaser, the fundamental rights associated with such class a preference stock will terminate. in addition, if such qualified stock purchaser (i) breaches in any material respect its obligations with respect to transfers of class a stock to large stockholders, (ii) breaches in any material respect any other restrictions on the transfer of class a stock or (iii) breaches its obligations under certain specified provisions of a standstill agreement into which such qualified stock purchaser has entered in accordance with the standstill agreement (a "qualified stock purchaser standstill agreement"), the shares of class a common stock owned by such qualified stock purchaser will, following certain procedural steps, immediately convert into common stock or, if any shares of class a preference stock are owned by such qualified stock purchaser, the fundamental rights associated with such class a preference stock will terminate. effect of conversion of class a common stock or termination of fundamental rights. a conversion of class a common stock into common stock or termination of fundamental rights will in most circumstances cause the termination of the disapproval rights of the class a holders under the articles and the termination of the rights of the class a holders under the stockholders' agreement with respect to (a) dispositions of long distance assets, (b) changes of control, (c) equity purchase rights, (d) major competitors of ft/dt, (e) major issuances, and (f) certain other matters. in addition, certain of the foregoing rights will be suspended if there is a suspension of the fundamental rights. upon such conversion of the class a common stock or the termination of the fundamental rights, the term of office of all class a directors will terminate. the vacancies resulting from such termination will be filled by the remaining directors then in office, acting by majority vote. the shares of class a stock issued by the issuer pursuant to the investment agreement, the stockholders' agreement or the articles subsequent to a conversion of all of the shares of class a common stock into common stock or a termination of the fundamental rights will automatically convert into shares of common stock. conversion in connection with an exclusionary tender offer. if the board determines not to oppose an exclusionary tender offer by a person other than ft, dt or their respective affiliates, and the terms of such tender offer do not permit the class a holders to sell an equal or greater percentage of their shares in class a stock as the other stockholders of the issuer are permitted to sell in such tender offer, the class a holders may require the issuer to convert certain of their shares of class a stock into common stock. conversion of common stock into class a stock. unless the fundamental rights have been terminated with respect to all outstanding shares of class a preference stock, (i) following the class a common issuance date and until page 20 of 27 pages the conversion of all of the shares of class a common stock into shares of common stock, each share of common stock acquired by a class a holder will automatically convert into one share of class a common stock on the date of such acquisition, and (ii) following the occurrence of the supplemental preference stock closing and prior to the class a common issuance date (the date on which class a common stock was first issued being referred to as the "class a common issuance date"), each share of common stock acquired by a class a holder will automatically convert into that number of shares of class a preference stock equal to the quotient of (x) the number of shares of class a preference stock outstanding immediately prior to such acquisition divided by (y) the number of shares of class a common stock or common stock into which such previously outstanding shares of class a preference stock would at such time be convertible at the then applicable conversion price. the ability of ft and dt to acquire shares of common stock is limited by the standstill agreement. certain additional relevant documents coordination agreement the coordination agreement, dated as of july 31, 1995, between ft and dt (the "coordination agreement") sets forth the terms on which ft and dt agree to coordinate their joint investment in the issuer. in addition to their general undertaking to use reasonable efforts to reach consensus on coordinated action within the necessary time frames, ft and dt have agreed, among other things, as follows: (a) in the event that ft and dt are permitted to acquire additional shares of class a stock (other than pursuant to sections 2.1 through 2.5 of the investment agreement) and common stock, each of ft and dt will be entitled to acquire one half of the aggregate amount thereof which they are both entitled to acquire, provided that if either of them owns less than half of such shares at such time, the party owning less shall be entitled to acquire up to all of such additional shares until both ft and dt own an equal number of voting securities of the issuer, and provided, further, that if either ft or dt does not want to acquire any or all of such additional shares, the other of them may acquire such unwanted shares; (b) in the event that ft and dt cannot decide how to vote their class a stock (including how to exercise their disapproval rights) with respect to any matter despite their undertakings to do so, they generally agree to abstain from voting their class a stock with respect to such matter; (c) ft and dt will alternate between themselves from year to year (with the first year being determined by lot) the right to appoint an extra director to the board at such times as they are entitled to appoint an odd number of directors to the board, and will alternate in a manner to be determined their right to appoint one or an odd number of directors to committees of the board; (d) in the event that ft and dt are entitled to acquire all or part of the long distance assets, each of ft and dt will be entitled to acquire an equal undivided interest in such assets, provided that if either ft or dt does not want to acquire any or all of its share of such long distance assets the other of them may acquire such unwanted share; (e) in the event that ft and dt are entitled to propose a transaction resulting in a change of control of the issuer, both parties agree to make such proposal jointly or not at all. if one party desires to make a proposal alone, it will not be entitled to proceed without the other's consent. subject to applicable fiduciary and other duties, if one of them has made a permitted change of control proposal the other of them will not transfer its class a stock into such a proposal made by a third party; (f) in the event that ft or dt propose to sell any of their shares of class a stock, the other of them shall generally have a right of first refusal to acquire such shares; and (g) each of ft and dt have agreed to indemnify the other for indemnifiable losses (as defined in the coordination agreement) caused by it as the result of breaches by it of the coordination agreement, the investment agreement, and the related documentation, among other matters. page 21 of 27 pages see, generally, the coordination agreement attached hereto as exhibit 5 and incorporated herein by reference. the description of the coordination agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. joint venture agreement - ----------------------- concurrently with the first closing under the investment agreement, the issuer, ft and dt also consummated a closing under the joint venture agreement, dated june 22, 1995, as amended (the "joint venture agreement"), among the issuer, sprint global venture, inc. ("sprint sub"), ft, dt and atlas. the issuer, sprint sub, ft, dt and atlas are collectively referred to as the "joint venture parties." the joint venture parties entered into the joint venture (the "joint venture") for the purpose of providing certain global telecommunications services (the "joint venture services") from time to time, which at the outset of the joint venture will include (i) global international data, voice and video business services for multinational companies and business customers, (ii) international services for consumers, initially based on card services for travelers, and (iii) a "carrier's carrier" business which will provide certain transport services for the issuer, ft, dt and other carriers. the joint venture services will be distributed in the rest of europe (other than france and germany) by a group of jv entities referred to as the "roe group" and in the rest of the world (other than europe and the united states) by a separate group of jv entities referred to as the "row group." the joint venture parties also formed an additional group of jv entities referred to as the "gbn group" to own and operate a global transmission network over which the joint venture services and other traffic will be routed as agreed by the joint venture parties, subject to applicable law and to existing arrangements of the joint venture parties. with respect to the row group and the gbn group, each of sprint sub and atlas initially will own, directly or indirectly, 50% of the outstanding voting equity of the parent entity of each such group. with respect to the roe group, sprint sub and atlas initially will own, directly or indirectly, 33-1/3% and 66-2/3%, respectively, of the voting equity of the parent entity of such group. see, generally,

(b) withdrawal. the selling stockholders shall have the right to request withdrawal of any registration statement filed pursuant to this section 1.1 (and the company shall so withdraw such registration statement) so long as such registration statement has not become effective, provided that, in such case, such selling stockholder shall pay all related out-of-pocket registration expenses reasonably incurred by the company unless a registration statement shall be effected pursuant to this section 1.1 within 270 days after such withdrawal. the selling stockholders, in accordance with section 2.5 of the stockholders' agreement, at any time and from time to time, may change the planned date of any registration statement to any date not more than 120 days after the original planned date with respect to such registration statement. (c) effective registration statement. a registration requested pursuant to this section 1.1 shall not be deemed to be effected (i) if a registration statement with respect thereto shall not have become effective under the securities act (including, without limitation, because of a withdrawal of such registration statement by the selling stockholders prior to the effectiveness thereof pursuant to section 1.1(b) hereof), (ii) if, after it has become effective, such registration is interfered with for any reason by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or any other governmental authority, and the result of such interference is to prevent the selling stockholders from disposing of more than one-third of the eligible securities proposed to be sold in accordance with the intended methods of disposition or the company exercises its rights under section 1.4 and the result is a delay in the proposed distribution of any eligible securities in excess of 120 days and the selling stockholders determine not to sell eligible securities pursuant to such registration as a result of such delay, or (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with any underwritten offering shall not be satisfied or waived with the consent of the selling stockholders holding two- thirds of the eligible securities that were to have been sold thereunder, other than as a result of any breach by any selling stockholder or any underwriter of its obligations thereunder or hereunder. (d) registration statement form. registration statements filed under this section 1.1 shall be on such form of the commission as shall be selected by the company, and as shall permit the disposition of the subject eligible securities for cash in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified by the selling stockholders. the selling stockholders may propose that the company include in a registration statement additional information or material specified by any selling stockholder and the company shall make a good faith determination whether to include such information or material in such registration statement.

(b) indemnification by the selling stockholders. the company may require, as a condition to including any eligible securities held by a selling stockholder in any registration statement filed pursuant to sections 1.1 and 1.2, that the company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from such selling stockholder, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in subsection (a) of this section 1.7) the company, each director, officer, employee, agent and advisor of the company and each other person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any application, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information prepared and furnished to the company by such selling stockholder specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement, or such application. such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, advisor or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such selling stockholder. the indemnity provided by each selling stockholder under this section 1.7(b) shall be only with respect to its own misstatements and omissions and not with respect to those of any other seller or prospective seller of securities, and not jointly and severally, and shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such selling stockholder from the sale of eligible securities pursuant to such registration statement. (c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subsections of this section 1.7, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subsections of this section 1.7, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified par- ty, unless a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties exists in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, if the indemnifying party is entitled to do so hereunder, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. (d) other remedies. if for any reason the indemnity set forth in the preceding subsections of this section 1.7 is unavailable, or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, other than by reason of the exceptions provided therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the offering of securities and the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statements or omissions. no party shall be liable for contribution under this subsection (d) except to the extent and under such circumstances as such party would have been liable to indemnify under this section 1.7 if such indemnification were enforceable under applicable law. section 1.8. effect of other agreements among the parties hereto. nothing in this agreement shall be

(a) subject to section 2.3(b), neither ft nor dt shall be deemed in violation of this article 2 if the beneficial ownership of sprint voting securities by ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates exceeds the applicable percentage limitation (i) solely as a result of an acquisition of sprint voting securities by sprint that, by reducing the number of outstanding sprint voting securities, increases the proportionate number of sprint voting securities beneficially owned by ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates, or (ii) because ft, dt or their respective affiliates or associates purchase shares in excess of the applicable percentage limitation in reliance on information regarding the number of outstanding shares of sprint provided directly to any of ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates by sprint in response to a request for such information by any of ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates immediately prior to such purchase. 7 (b) notwithstanding section 2.3(a), the applicable percentage limitation shall be deemed exceeded if (i) in the case of section 2.3(a)(i), ft, dt or any of their respective affiliates or associates acquires beneficial ownership of any additional sprint voting securities after it has been notified of an acquisition of sprint voting securities by sprint, or (ii) in the case of section 2.3(a)(ii), ft, dt or any of their respective affiliates or associates acquires beneficial ownership of additional sprint voting securities after it has been notified that the information regarding the number of outstanding shares previously provided to it was incorrect and it has been provided by sprint with correct information, unless in the case of clause (i) or (ii): (x) upon the acquisition of beneficial ownership of such additional sprint voting securities, ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates do not beneficially own in the aggregate more than the applicable percentage limitation, or (y) subject to the rights of sprint in section 5.7 of the stockholders' agreement, such acquisition is effected pursuant to (a) the exercise of equity purchase rights by ft or dt pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, or (b) market purchases which are made solely in lieu of the exercise of equity purchase rights by ft or dt pursuant to the stockholders' agreement following the issuance of securities by sprint, so long as (1) either (i) ft or dt, as the case may be, has irrevocably waived its rights to exercise the equity purchase rights in respect of which such market purchases are made in lieu thereof, or (ii) the time period for the exercise of such equity purchase rights has expired without the exercise of such rights, and (2) following such market purchases, the percentage ownership interest of ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates does not exceed the percentage ownership interest of ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates which would have been in effect had ft, dt and their respective affiliates exercised such equity purchase rights. section 2.4. sprint rights plan.

(b) if the sprint board of directors amends or waives the provisions of the sprint rights plan in such a manner to permit an other holder to acquire beneficial ownership of sprint voting securities having votes in excess of the applicable percentage limitation without such acquisition resulting in the other holder being deemed an acquiring person or resulting in the occurrence of a stock acquisition date, distribution date, section 11(a)(ii) event or section 13 event or makes any other changes to the sprint rights plan which would permit any other holder to own sprint voting securities having votes in excess of the applicable percentage limitation without triggering adverse consequences under the sprint rights plan to such other holder, then sprint will amend or waive the provisions of the sprint rights plan so that the sprint rights plan does not impose any prohibition (including any prohibition on the ownership of voting securities), on ft, dt and their respective affiliates and associates which is more restrictive than the restrictions imposed on any other holder. article 3. other standstill provisions;

now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations set forth herein, each of the parties hereby agrees as follows: article i principles of coordination -------------------------- section 1.1 joint or coordinated action. the parties desire to coordinate the exercise of their respective rights and obligations as parties to the investment documents and as holders of class a stock under the corporate documents, and the parties shall make reasonable efforts in good faith to reach consensus on appropriate coordinated action within the necessary time frames. if the parties are unable to reach consensus on coordinated action despite their efforts pursuant to this section 1.1, the relevant provisions of this agreement shall apply. section 1.2 relative shareholdings. for so long as the restrictions set forth in section 7.5(b) of the stockholders' agreement (or any successor provision thereto) shall remain in effect, and notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no party shall acquire or dispose of shares of class a stock or other voting securities of the company if, as a result thereof, the ratio of the committed percentage of one party (and its qualified subsidiaries) to the committed percentage of the other party (and its qualified subsidiaries) would be greater than (i) until the investment completion date, 1 to 1, and (ii) thereafter, 3 to 2. section 1.3 holdings of associates. each party shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of the persons listed on schedule a to the investment agreement (as to ft) or schedule b to the investment agreement (as to dt) shall, in the aggregate, beneficially own voting securities of the company representing less than 0.05% of the voting power of the company. in addition, the parties shall consult with each other on a regular basis concerning such other arrangements as they may from time to time deem necessary or reasonably appropriate for the purpose of monitoring and administering the provisions of the standstill agreement relating to voting securities of the company beneficially owned by such associates. -2- section 1.4 no impairment of rights. except with the concurrence of the other party or to the extent otherwise expressly required by this agreement, no party shall take any action with respect to the subject matter of this agreement if such action would impair the rights of the other party under this agreement or any of the relevant documents or would impair the ability of the other party to comply with its obligations hereunder or thereunder. section 1.5 further assurances. each party shall, within any applicable time periods, execute and deliver such additional agreements, documents or other instruments as may be necessary, or as may be reasonably requested by the other party, to give effect to the rights and obligations provided for in this agreement, to render effective the transactions contemplated hereby, and otherwise to carry out, to the fullest extent possible, the intent and purposes of this agreement and to enable the parties to achieve the practical benefits intended hereby. article ii purchases of class a stock -------------------------- section 2.1 optional purchase rights. (a) if the relevant documents permit the parties to acquire shares of class a stock of the company other than pursuant to sections 2.1 through 2.5, inclusive, of the investment agreement (such non-excluded shares being the "elective shares"), then each party shall be entitled to purchase (directly from the company, if appropriate, or otherwise pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to each party) half of such elective shares; provided that, at a time when one party beneficially owns fewer voting securities of the company than the other party, the party owning fewer shares shall be entitled (but not obligated) to acquire as many (including all) of such elective shares as shall permit it to beneficially own the same number of voting securities of the company as the other party after giving effect to the acquisition by both parties (or by such party, as the case may be) of all such elective shares. if the relevant documents specify a number of elective shares each party may purchase individually which is different from that amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the parties will make such arrangements as are reasonably necessary to enable each party to acquire the number of elective shares determined pursuant to the preceding sentence. such arrangements may include having the party that wants to purchase fewer elective shares act as the nominee of the other party. each party shall make reasonable efforts to purchase all of the elective shares which it is entitled to purchase pursuant to the relevant documents. -3- (b) except with respect to purchases made pursuant to section 7.3 of the stockholders' agreement, each party shall, promptly (and, in any event, not later than fifteen days prior to any notification deadline set forth in the relevant documents) after becoming aware of its right to do so, notify the other party in writing of the extent to which it intends to purchase from the company any elective shares to which it is entitled. if one party does not elect to purchase all of the elective shares to which it is entitled, then the other party may elect to purchase such number as it shall desire to purchase of the elective shares which the initial party has indicated it is not interested in purchasing, and the parties will make such arrangements as are reasonably necessary to enable such other party to acquire such elective shares. such arrangements may include having the party that did not want to purchase such elective shares act as the nominee of the other party. section 2.2 pricing elections. if, pursuant to section 3(b)(iii)(x), 3(b)(iii)(y)(3)(a) or 3(b)(iii)(y)(4)(b) of the class a provisions, the parties shall be entitled to fix the conversion price of their class a preference stock at the target price, the new target price or 93.308% of the new target price, as the case may be, they shall confer in a timely manner and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on whether or not to exercise such election. if the parties cannot agree on the action to be taken, they shall not exercise such election. section 2.3 conversion elections. (a) if, pursuant to section 3(a)(iii) of the class a provisions, the parties shall be entitled to postpone the conversion of their class a preference stock into class a common stock, they shall confer in a timely manner and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on whether or not to exercise such election. if the parties cannot agree on the action to be taken, they shall notify the company that they elect to postpone the conversion of their class a preference stock. (b) if, pursuant to section 3(b)(v) or 7(f)(ii) of the class a provisions, the parties shall be entitled to convert their class a preference stock into class a common stock or into common stock, as the case may be, they shall confer in a timely manner and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on whether or not to exercise such election. if the parties cannot agree on the action to be taken, they shall not exercise such election. (c) if, pursuant to section 7(m) of the class a provisions, the parties shall be entitled to convert certain shares of their class a preference stock into common stock, they shall confer in a timely manner and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on whether or not to exercise such election. if the parties cannot agree on the action to be taken, each party shall be entitled to -4- elect to convert the number of its own such shares as it deems appropriate and all parties shall join in notifying the company of each such election. section 2.4 redemption election. if, pursuant to section 7(n) of the class a provisions, the parties shall be entitled to request the company to redeem their class a preference stock, they shall confer in a timely manner and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on whether or not to exercise such election. if the parties cannot agree on the action to be taken, they shall notify the company that they elect to have the company redeem their class a preference stock. section 2.5 qualified stock purchasers. if at any time the parties are permitted pursuant to the relevant documents to assign their rights to purchase shares to a qualified stock purchaser, then the parties shall confer promptly to decide whether to assign such rights, and shall make reasonable efforts to agree on a single qualified stock purchaser to act jointly for both of them. if the parties cannot agree on such a single qualified stock purchaser or on any of the material terms relating thereto, they may each proceed independently. article iii purchases of common stock ------------------------- section 3.1 applicability. until the minimum holding termination date, all purchases of common stock by the parties from a person other than the company shall be made only as provided in this article iii. the term "minimum holding termination date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the date on which the transfer restrictions are terminated pursuant to section 2.6 of the stockholders' agreement, (ii) the date on which all of the class a stock converts to common stock of the company, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the initial issuance date. section 3.2 purchase allocations. (a) if the relevant documents permit the parties to acquire shares of common stock or other voting securities of the company (other than class a stock), then each party shall be entitled to purchase half of such shares or voting securities; provided that, at a time when one party beneficially owns fewer voting securities of the company than the other party, then the party owning fewer shares shall, notwithstanding anything in this agreement or in any relevant document, be entitled (but not obligated) to acquire as many (including all) of such additional shares as shall permit it to beneficially own the same number of voting securities of the company as the other party after giving effect to the acquisition by both parties (or by such party, as the case may be) of all -5- such additional shares. if the relevant documents specify a number of shares of common stock or other voting securities of the company (other than class a stock) that each party may purchase individually which is different from that number of such shares determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the parties will make such arrangements as are reasonably necessary to enable each party to acquire the number of such shares determined pursuant to the preceding sentence. such arrangements may include having the party that wants to purchase fewer such shares act as the nominee of the other party. (b) promptly (and, in any event, not later than fifteen days prior to any notification deadline set forth in the relevant documents) after becoming aware of its right to do so, each party shall notify the other party in writing of the extent to which it intends to purchase shares of common stock in accordance herewith and with the relevant documents. if one party elects to purchase less than all (including none) of the common stock to which it is entitled, then the other party may elect to purchase all or any number of the shares of common stock which the initial party has indicated it is not interested in purchasing. the parties shall promptly agree upon a period (the "market purchase period") within which they plan to purchase the shares of common stock they each have agreed to purchase (the "market shares"). section 3.3 coordination of market purchases. the parties shall establish a purchasing strategy with respect to all purchases of market shares designed to minimize the market impact of such purchases. to the greatest extent possible, the parties shall purchase market shares jointly in the same transactions and/or through the same brokers, with the number of shares purchased allocated pro rata in accordance with the allocation of market shares agreed to pursuant to section 3.2. article iv governance provisions --------------------- section 4.1 voting of securities. (a) promptly following notice from the company that the holders of the class a stock may vote on or take any class a action with respect to any issue unrelated to the election of class a directors, the parties shall confer in good faith to come to a common position on how to vote on or take such class a action with respect to such issue. each party shall, mindful of its obligation pursuant to section 7.5(b) of the stockholders' agreement, make reasonable efforts to accommodate, to the greatest extent practicable and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to each party, the position of the other party. in the exceptional circumstance that, notwithstanding the foregoing and after consultation at the highest levels, the parties are unable to agree upon a common position on such issue, -6- the parties shall abstain from voting on such issue or shall abstain from taking such class a action with respect to such issue, as the case may be. (b) following the conversion of all of the class a stock into shares of common stock of the company, each party shall, if so requested by the other party (i) confer in good faith concerning any issue upon which the common stock shall be entitled to vote, and (ii) make reasonable efforts to come to a common position if possible on how to vote with respect to such issue. (c) each party shall cause its qualified subsidiaries to vote the shares of class a stock held by them in accordance with any agreement reached with respect thereto pursuant to this section 4.1. section 4.2 mutual support of board nominees. the parties shall confer to ensure that each of their candidates to the company's board of directors is chosen from substantially equivalent levels of management within their respective organizations. a party may nominate a board candidate from outside such party's organization only with the consent of the other party. in any election of class a directors by the class a holders, each party shall vote its shares of class a stock in support of the candidate or candidates nominated by the other party. section 4.3 number of directors. except as otherwise provided in this section 4.3, each of the parties shall be entitled to nominate to the board of directors of the company one-half of the total number of class a directors that the holders of class a stock have the right to elect. if the number of class a directors is an odd number, then the right to appoint the remaining director shall rotate between the parties from year to year, with the appointment right in the first year determined by lot. section 4.4 committee representation. each party shall be entitled to designate one-half of the number of class a directors that the holders of class a stock are entitled or permitted to nominate to the executive committee and each other committee of the board of directors of the company; provided that, if the holders of class a stock are entitled to nominate only one or any other odd number of directors to a committee, then the right to designate the sole or odd- numbered director shall alternate in a manner reasonably agreed to by the parties. section 4.5 replacement of directors. at the request of one party, the other party shall vote its shares of class a stock to remove the director or directors nominated by such requesting -7- party, and shall vote its shares of class a stock to elect or appoint as directors any replacements therefor nominated or designated by such requesting party. section 4.6 stockholder matters. except as provided in the following sentence, each of the parties shall attend all meetings of the stockholders of the company either in person (through an authorized officer, employee or agent of such party) or by proxy. if either party wishes not to attend any such meeting in person, it shall notify the other party in writing in advance thereof and shall grant such proxy to the other party (or to its officers, employees or agents who will be acting for such other party) if such other party so requests. nothing in this section 4.6 shall be construed as limiting the manner in which any party may vote on any matter, whether in person, by written consent or by proxy. section 4.7 actions with respect to obligations of the company. (a) waivers or consents. each party shall promptly notify the other in writing of its receipt of any request from the company for a waiver of a requirement that the company perform any of its obligations under the relevant documents or for a consent (other than any consent of the nature referred to in section 4.1(a)) to any action to be taken by the company. if the parties cannot agree on whether to grant such waiver or consent, as the case may be, such waiver or consent shall not be granted; provided that either party may grant such a waiver or consent if such waiver or consent (i) relates to any action, omission or set of facts or circumstances solely affecting such party, and (ii) would not impair in any manner the rights of the other party under, or impair in any manner the ability of the other party to comply with its obligations under, this agreement or the relevant documents. (b) declarations of breach or default. each party shall confer promptly with the other if it is concerned that the company (or any related party) may have breached of any of its (or such related party's) obligations under the relevant documents. if, after such consultations, the parties cannot agree on whether to declare formally that such a breach constitutes a default under the relevant documents, such declaration shall not be made; provided that (i) either party may make such a declaration if such declaration (x) relates to any action, omission or set of facts or circumstances solely affecting such party, and (y) would not impair in any manner the rights of the other party under, or impair in any manner the ability of the other party to comply with its obligations under, this agreement or the relevant documents, and (ii) nothing in this clause -8- (b) shall estop or otherwise limit the ability of a party to assert by way of defense or counterclaim that such a breach or default has occurred. article v long distance assets -------------------- section 5.1 sale of long distance assets.

(b) within thirty days of its receipt of an ld sale notice, each party shall notify the other party in writing of the amount, if any, of the undivided interest in such specified long distance assets such party is willing to purchase. if one party elects not to purchase the entire undivided interest to which it is entitled in such specified long distance assets, then the other party may purchase all or any portion of the undivided interest therein which the first party has elected not to purchase. (c) if, after giving effect to the foregoing, the parties have elected between them to purchase less than all of the specified long distance assets, then the parties shall promptly notify the company in writing that they shall not purchase such specified long distance assets. if, after giving effect to the foregoing, the parties have elected (or if one party, in accordance with the foregoing, has elected) to purchase all of such specified long distance assets, the parties shall so notify the company in writing and shall take all actions necessary to purchase such specified long distance assets from the company. such actions shall, to the extent necessary or reasonably appropriate, be performed by each party (whether or not such party is an acquiring party) and shall include the execution and delivery of such assignments, instruments of transfer and other instruments as are necessary or reasonably appropriate for the acquisition of such specified long distance assets. each party shall be responsible for its share (based upon the undivided interest such party has agreed to purchase) of all costs relating to such purchase. section 5.2 qualified ld purchasers. (a) if the parties are at any time permitted to assign their right to purchase specified long distance assets described in an ld sale notice to a qualified ld purchaser, they shall make reasonable efforts to agree upon a single qualified ld purchaser within the ld option -9- period described in section 3.1(d) of the stockholders' agreement. if the parties shall have selected a single prospective qualified ld purchaser to act for them, they shall notify the company of their selection. (b) if the parties cannot agree upon a single qualified ld purchaser or upon any of the material terms relating thereto, then each party may select a qualified ld purchaser to act for it alone; provided that it has first consulted with the other party and has made reasonable efforts to select a qualified ld purchaser to act for it reasonably acceptable to such other party. if each of the parties shall have selected a prospective qualified ld purchaser to act for it in accordance with the foregoing sentence, they shall notify the company of their selections. (c) if, after giving effect to the foregoing, the parties are unable to select a single qualified ld purchaser to act for them collectively, or are unable to select qualified ld purchasers to act for them individually, the parties shall notify the company of their election not to purchase the specified long distance assets described in the ld sale notice referred to above. section 5.3 lien foreclosures. the provisions of this article v shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the parties' exercise of any right to purchase set forth in section 3.1(b) of the stockholders' agreement arising out of the foreclosure or other execution upon long distance assets encumbered by a lien of the nature referred to in such section 3.1(b). article vi sales of shares --------------- section 6.1 right of

notice") to the other party (the "offeree party") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the number of shares proposed to be transferred, (ii) the price per share at which such shares are proposed to be transferred, and (iii) any other terms and conditions of such offer which are material. if, within thirty days of its receipt of an offer notice, the offeree party has notified the selling party of

offer notice (or, if less, the maximum number of shares permitted to be acquired under section 1.2 hereof) on the terms and conditions set forth therein (subject, however, to receipt of any required material governmental approvals or third party approvals, compliance with applicable law, and the absence of any injunction or similar legal order prohibiting such transfer). if the offeree party's

terms no more favorable than those set forth in such offer notice. section 6.2 sales of shares to the company. if the parties shall be obligated to sell shares of class a stock to the company pursuant to the relevant documents, they shall confer promptly to decide upon all requisite terms upon which such sale is to be consummated that may need to be decided by them. if the parties shall have the right to sell shares of class a stock to the company pursuant to the relevant documents and the relevant documents do not expressly state the number of shares each party may sell to the company or do not expressly state some other material term or condition of such sale, the parties shall confer promptly to decide whether to sell such shares to the company and/or to decide upon all requisite

and, if so, on the timing and the other material terms thereof (including, if applicable, the selection of a managing or lead underwriter or underwriters therefor). if either party does not desire to exercise such a demand registration right at such time and only three or fewer such demands remain under the registration rights agreement, then the other party may proceed only with the consent of the former (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). with respect to each demand registration in which both parties are participating, the parties shall request the company to register a number of shares equal to the sum of the number of shares each party wishes to register, and any scale-backs or other reductions in the number of shares registered shall be -11- allocated

other party. article vii change of control of the company -------------------------------- section 7.1 joint action. if the parties shall have the right under the relevant documents to propose any transaction having the goal of obtaining control of the company (a "control proposal"), they shall confer promptly to decide whether (and, if applicable, how) to make such control proposal. if both

party may proceed only with the consent of the other party. section 7.2 competing proposals. each party hereby agrees, except as their fiduciary or other statutory duties may otherwise require, not to transfer its shares of class a stock (or of any common stock into which such shares may be converted pursuant to the articles) to a person making a control proposal in competition with any control proposal being made by the bidding party in conformity with section 7.1. article viii indemnification --------------- section 8.1 indemnification. each party (in such capacity, the "indemnifying party") hereby indemnifies, and holds the other party (the "indemnified party") harmless from and against, any and all losses, liabilities, damages, obligations, deficiencies, payments, costs and

attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation in connection therewith), but excluding indirect, incidental and consequential damages, damages relating to lost business opportunities and indirect or intangible losses) (each such non-excluded item an "indemnifiable loss") suffered by the indemnified party arising out of, or due to, directly or indirectly: (a) any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by the indemnifying party under this agreement; (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by the indemnifying party (whether to be performed -12- alone or jointly with the indemnified party) in favor of the company or any other person under any of the relevant documents; or (c) any inaccuracy or other breach of any representation or warranty made by the indemnifying party in favor of the company or any other person under any of the relevant documents. section 8.2 additional provisions. the parties shall cooperate in good faith regarding the defense,

(c) any and all disputes that are not resolved by the parties pursuant to section 21.1(b) or otherwise shall be solely and finally settled by a board of three arbitrators in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce (the "icc rules"), as such icc rules shall be modified herein or by subsequent agreement of the affected parties. any party, either separately or together with one or more other parties, may initiate arbitration proceedings against any other party. the party so initiating arbitration proceedings shall so notify the secretariat of the international court of arbitration (the "icc court") by filing with the icc court a request for arbitration. the information filed with and as part of such request for arbitration shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of the icc rules except that the party filing such request for arbitration shall not nominate an arbitrator and shall include in the request for arbitration a notice to the icc court that the parties have agreed to not nominate any arbitrators until the expiration of all the periods set forth herein for the joinder or intervention of other parties. (d) because the expeditious resolution of disputes will depend in part on the prompt joinder or intervention of appropriate parties, and because the procedures agreed by the parties relating to joinder and intervention are integrally related to the time periods within which answers and counterclaims must be filed, the parties hereby direct the icc court to refrain from granting extensions of the time periods contained in article 4 of the icc rules unless such extensions are absolutely essential in order to permit a disputant to submit a responsive answer or counterclaim. when granted, such extensions should be limited to the minimum period necessary to permit the disputant to complete its answer or counterclaim in a responsive manner. further, because the disputants will have previously discussed the issues relating to the dispute during the internal dispute resolution process conducted pursuant to section 21.1(b), the parties contemplate that it would be unlikely that any disputant would require an extension exceeding sixty (60) days in order to prepare a responsive answer or counterclaim. (e) whenever any filing is required or otherwise made in connection with any arbitration proceeding commenced under this article 21, the disputant making such filing shall send a copy of the filing, together with all attachments and exhibits thereto, (i) to each other disputant, (ii) to each other party to the section 21.1 agreement to which the dispute relates or arises under, and (iii) to the global venture board (such disputants, - clv - other parties and the global venture board are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "notice parties"). (f) this agreement to arbitrate, as set forth in this article 21, shall be specifically enforceable. pursuant to article 192 of chapter 12 of the swiss federal statute on private international law (december 18, 1987), the parties expressly waive and exclude any right they may have to bring any action of appeal, annulment or recourse, including any setting aside proceeding, in reference to any award made in connection with arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to this article 21, insofar as such waiver may be validly made. section 21.2. joinder; intervention; cross claims (a) upon receipt of a request for arbitration, notice of counterclaim or notice of joinder, any disputant may join any other party to any arbitral proceedings commenced hereunder, provided that such joinder is based upon a dispute which has common issues of law or fact as the dispute arising under the relevant request for arbitration or a defendant's counterclaim, if any. such joinder shall be made through written notice to the icc court and the notice parties within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the request for arbitration, notice of counterclaim or notice of joinder, as the case may be, which first describes facts or issues upon which such joinder would be based. the notice of joinder shall contain the following information: (i) name and address of the joined party; and (ii) a statement of the disputant's case with relation to the party that the disputant is joining. the joined party may within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the notice of joinder set out its defense and (provided that it is based upon a dispute which has common issues of law or fact as the dispute arising under the relevant notice of joinder) counterclaim, if any, and supply relevant documents. if the joined party sets out a defense or counterclaim, it shall send copies to the icc court and the notice parties. (b) at any time prior to the expiration of the later of the period within which a defendant must file its answer and the period within which a joined party must file its answer (and counterclaims, if any), any party may intervene in any arbitral proceedings hereunder provided that such intervention is based upon a dispute which has issues of law or fact common to the dispute arising under the relevant request for arbitration or a disputant's answer or counterclaim, if any. the notice of intervention shall contain the following information: (i) name and address of the intervening party; and (ii) a statement of the intervening party's case with relation to the claimant, the defendant and any other disputant. (c) any disputant may, at the same time as it serves its answer or its defense to a notice of intervention, notice of joinder or a counterclaim, as the case may be, make a cross-claim - clvi - against any other disputant, provided that such cross-claim is based upon a dispute which has common issues of law or fact as the dispute arising under the relevant request for arbitration, notice of joinder, notice of intervention or counterclaim, as the case may be. (d) for purposes of any arbitration proceedings initiated under this article 21, the words "or cross-claims" shall be deemed to be included after the words "the parties may make new claims or counterclaims" in article 16 of the icc rules. (e) if a disputant knowingly fails to join, or otherwise fails to make clear in its answer that there may be a party that is not a disputant against whom a claimant may reasonably be expected to have a claim, such disputant shall thereafter be barred from asserting as a defense that the claimant is seeking recovery against the incorrect disputant, provided that such disputant's failure to join another party shall not otherwise affect its rights against such party. section 21.3. effect of joinder and intervention. any joined or intervening party shall become a disputant, and shall be bound by any award rendered by the arbitral tribunal, even if it chooses not to participate in the arbitral proceedings. section 21.4. selection of arbitrators. (a) no arbitrators shall be nominated until the expiration of all periods within which parties may intervene or be joined. (b) when a dispute involves a disagreement between two disputants, within thirty (30) days after the date beyond which no further intervention or joinder is permitted, each disputant shall nominate one arbitrator for confirmation by the icc court, in accordance with the icc rules. if one of the disputants fails to nominate an arbitrator within this period, the icc court shall appoint an arbitrator for that disputant in accordance with article 2.6 of the icc rules. the two arbitrators nominated by the disputants (and confirmed by the icc court) or appointed on behalf of the disputants (as the case may be) shall jointly nominate a third arbitrator, who shall be confirmed by the icc court in accordance with article 2.4 of the icc rules and who shall chair the arbitration panel. if the arbitrators nominated by the disputants (and confirmed by the icc court) or appointed on behalf of the disputants (as the case may be) do not succeed in nominating a third arbitrator for confirmation by the icc court within thirty (30) days after the latter of the two arbitrators nominated by the disputants (and confirmed by the icc court) or appointed on behalf of the disputants (as the case may be) has been confirmed or appointed, the third arbitrator shall, at the request of either disputant, be appointed by the icc court. the third arbitrator confirmed or appointed shall be a recognized legal expert in new york law with extensive experience - clvii - in relation to the issues involved in the dispute and shall have full command of the english language. any claim that the third arbitrator (i) is not a recognized legal expert in new york law with extensive experience in relation to the issues involved in the dispute or (ii) does not have full command of the english language must be submitted to the icc court within sixty (60) days of the appointment of such third arbitrator or any such claim shall be permanently waived. (c) when a dispute exists such that there are more than two disputants, and within thirty (30) days after the date beyond which no further intervention or joinder is permitted no agreement can be reached among the disputants regarding the method of nomination of arbitrators such that only two arbitrators shall be nominated by the disputants, the disputants shall so notify the icc court. in that event, the disputants expressly waive and renounce any right, under the icc rules or otherwise, to the appointment of an arbitrator of their choice. upon such notice, the icc court shall appoint all three arbitrators and shall designate one of such arbitrators as the chair of the arbitration panel. the arbitrators so appointed shall be recognized legal experts in new york law with extensive experience in relation to the issues involved in the dispute and shall have full command of the english language. any claim that any of the arbitrators so appointed (i) is not a recognized legal expert in new york law with extensive experience in relation to the issues involved in the dispute or (ii) does not have full command of the english language must be submitted to the icc court within sixty (60) days of the appointment of such arbitrators or any such claim shall be permanently waived. section 21.5. arbitration proceedings. all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the english language pursuant to the icc rules, as such icc rules shall be modified herein or by subsequent agreement of the affected parties. any disputant, in its sole discretion, may at its expense request that an interpreter be retained to assist such disputant in any arbitration proceeding. the arbitration shall take place in geneva, switzerland at a location, date and time reasonably acceptable to the parties. the disputants shall use all reasonable efforts to facilitate the arbitration by making available to each other and to the arbitrators for inspection and extraction all documents, books, records and, at any hearing, personnel under their control as the arbitrators shall determine to be relevant to the dispute and by conducting arbitration hearings to the greatest extent possible on successive, contiguous days. nothing herein shall waive or preclude any objection based upon any privilege to production or testimony recognized by the law of the state of new york. the advance to cover the costs of conducting the arbitration proceeding shall be borne in accordance with article 9.2 of the icc rules. however, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event there are more than two parties to the proceeding, the advance to cover the costs of conducting the proceeding shall be allocated in such - clviii - manner as the icc court may deem just and equitable in the circumstances. section 21.6. decision of the arbitrators. (a) the arbitral tribunal shall decide on all issues concerning the merits, including quantum and interest, of any claim, counterclaim or cross- claim brought before it in any arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this article 21, except for those concerning the costs of the proceedings, in one or more partial awards (each, a "partial award"), which shall state the reasons for the award. each partial award shall be final and binding as to the subject matters dealt with therein. (b) if an arbitral tribunal determines in any partial award that a party (the "breaching party") has breached section 9.1, 9.2, 15.11,, 15.12(b), 15.12(f), 15.13, 15.14, 17.2, 17.3 or 18.1(b) or article 10 or 19 of this agreement or any provision of any section 21.1 agreement which expressly provides that a breach of such provision will constitute a material non-funding breach (any such breach a "material non-funding breach"), the partial award shall include a statement describing in reasonable detail the conduct that caused the material non-funding breach and the steps that the breaching party must take to cure such breach. if the breaching party does not immediately (i) cease the violative conduct which gave rise to the arbitral tribunal's determination in the partial award that a material non-funding breach has occurred and (ii) comply in all material respects with the terms and conditions specified in the partial award (including complying with section 15.9 in respect of a material non-funding breach), any party may, during the 45-day period beginning on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the notification to the parties of the partial award determining that a material non-funding breach has occurred, notify both the breaching party and the arbitral tribunal of its belief that the breaching party has not complied with such clause (i) or (ii). within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice, the arbitral tribunal shall issue a partial award in which it shall determine if the breaching party (1) has ceased or continued the violative conduct which gave rise to the determination of the material non-funding breach and (2) has or has not complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the partial award, such finding to be a "material non-funding breach finding." (c) following the issuance by the arbitral tribunal of the partial award that either alone or with any preceding award resolves all the issues that had been set forth for resolution in the terms of reference (except for costs), the arbitral tribunal shall render its final award (the "final award"), in which it shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear the costs (excluding legal fees and expenses except as permitted by section 15.9) in connection with such proceedings or in what proportions such costs shall be borne by the parties, in accordance with section 15.9 hereof and article - clix - 20 of the icc rules. the arbitral tribunal shall also make any material non-funding breach finding within the time limits indicated in section 21.6(b) with respect to the last partial award, before rendering the final award. (d) judgment on any award, whether a partial award or final award, may be entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. (e) the arbitral tribunal shall have the authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for the specific performance of any section 21.1 agreement or a portion thereof, but it shall have no power or authority to award punitive damages. (f) any monetary award of the arbitrators shall be expressed in u.s. dollars. any such monetary award shall include interest from the date of any breach or any violation of this agreement or any other section 21.1 agreement. the arbitrators shall fix an appropriate rate of interest from the date of the breach or other violation to the date when the award is paid in full. in no event shall the interest rate during such period be lower than a rate equal to the applicable libor rate plus 5 percentage points per annum. (g) in reaching its decisions on the claims, counterclaims and cross- claims brought before it, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the relevant provisions of this agreement (including section 15.9) and any other section 21.1 agreement at issue and the applicable law. (h) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 21.6, a dispute submitted to arbitration pursuant to section 16.8(d) shall be decided solely in the manner contemplated therein. section 21.7. injunctive relief. except for a dispute pursuant to section 16.8(d), each party shall have the right to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal interim relief in aid of arbitration or to protect the rights of such party in respect of any provision contained in the section 21.1 agreement to which the dispute relates. any request for such interim relief by a party shall not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver of, this agreement to arbitrate. the parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any party fails to perform its obligations under section 15.11 or 18.1(b) or article 10 or 19. section 21.8. other section 21.1 agreements. the provisions of this article 21 shall apply to this agreement, each other operative agreement (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise therein) and all other section 21.1 -

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of a material non-funding default by either ft (or wholly owned subsidiary of ft holding venture interests as permitted by this agreement) or dt (or wholly owned subsidiary of dt holding venture interests as permitted by this agreement) under section 9.1, 9.2, 15.11, 15.12(b), 17.2, 17.3 or 18.1(b) or article 10 of this agreement or under any article 21.1 agreement (other than a material non-funding default by any such person under a provision of an article 21.1 agreement which is similar to section 15.12(e), 15.13, 15.14(c) or 20.2(c) or article 19 of this agreement), the consummation by the non-defaulting party of the purchase of the venture interests of the defaulting european party as provided in this section 20.5(c) shall be treated, without any further action by such non-defaulting -17- european party, as a cure of such material non-funding default. for purposes of this agreement, the venture interests of a defaulting european party shall include the venture interests of all ft/dt parties other than the non-defaulting european party (including the venture interests held by such non-defaulting european party through atlas or any other qualified venture subsidiary of the ft/dt parties)." section 2.18. amendments to article 21 of the june 22 jva. section 21.1 is amended by adding the following new section 21.1(g): "(g) each of the parties agrees that the arbitration provisions of this article 21 preclude the parties from commencing proceedings under section 592 et seq. of the german, civil procedures with respect to any dispute and agrees not to initiate any proceedings under such section with respect to any dispute." section 2.19. amendments to article 22 of the june 22 jva. section 22.2 is amended to read in its entirety as follows: "section 22.2. transition plan. the parties agree that, following the occurrence of an event described in section 22.1, they will negotiate in good faith to develop a plan (the "transition plan") which will govern the rights and obligations of the parties under the operative agreements. the transition plan will be based on the principles described in schedule 22.2. each of the parties agrees to cause its affiliates and, insofar as within its control, the jv entities, to comply with the provisions of the transition plan." section 2.20. amendments to article 23 of the june 22 jva.

withdrawing party provided, however, that no such notification or public announcement of the withdrawal of a party from the joint venture shall be made until the withdrawal date, unless an earlier announcement shall be required by law or stock market rules. for purposes of identifying customers under contracts in existence on the withdrawal date, (i) if sprint is the withdrawing party, customers for which sprint is the distributing entity will be considered customers of sprint with respect to contracts in existence on the withdrawal date, (ii) if ft is the withdrawing party, customers for which ft is the distributing entity will be considered customers of ft with respect to contracts in existence on the withdrawal date, (iii) if dt is the withdrawing party, customers for which dt is the distributing entity will be considered customers of dt with respect to contracts in existence on the withdrawal date, and (iv) all other customers under contracts in existence on the

customers of the joint venture with which the joint venture has engaged in confidential communications or negotiations prior to the withdrawal date. in addition, during such period, neither the joint venture nor any non- withdrawing party shall offer products or services in competition with the withdrawing party to customers of the withdrawing party. nothing in this paragraph 3 shall be deemed to prohibit any activities that would be permitted under the noncompete provisions of article 10 of the jva were it still in effect during such period. further, nothing in this paragraph 3 shall be deemed to prohibit a withdrawing party from indirectly offering products or services to such customers or prospective customers of the joint venture through another international telecommunications

or bankruptcy, such withdrawing party shall not be permitted to compete with the joint venture through another international telecommunications alliance during the one-year period after the withdrawal

"pay back" date of such contracts of the joint venture which are supported by the withdrawing party and (ii) the expiration of such contracts of the joint venture which are supported by the withdrawing party. the withdrawing party shall also continue to support new sales of joint venture products and services, such support not to continue beyond two years after the withdrawal date.

of such contracts of the withdrawing party which are supported by the joint venture and (ii) the expiration of such contracts of the withdrawing party which are supported by the joint venture. the joint venture, the withdrawing party and each non- withdrawing party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to secure such alternative support as promptly as practicable after the withdrawal date. 5. the transition rules with respect to trademarks and intellectual property of a withdrawing party and trademarks and intellectual property of the joint venture or the other parties used by the withdrawing party shall be as provided in the intellectual property agreements. 6. subject to paragraph 7, all outsourcing, service bureau and similar service and support contracts between the withdrawing party and the joint venture shall remain in place on the same terms and conditions at the discretion of the joint venture for a period of up to 2 years after the withdrawal date to provide for an orderly and timely transition, or for such longer period as may be necessary to permit the joint venture to fulfill contracts with customers which are supported by such outsourcing, service bureau and similar service and support arrangements, and the withdrawing party shall cooperate at its own expense during such period in transferring capabilities, processes and systems to alternative support capabilities. 7. to the extent practicable, the joint venture shall have the right to purchase at fair market value the systems, capital equipment and other assets of the withdrawing party and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, employ the personnel of the withdrawing party to the extent that such personnel, systems, capital equipment and other assets are dedicated substantially to providing support and services to the joint venture under outsourcing or service bureau or similar service and support contracts. 8. a plan action project that can be accounted for separately and that can be transferred to the joint venture under the jva shall be considered an integral part of the joint venture, and the joint venture shall have the right to buy out the withdrawing party at the time of the withdrawal of such party from the joint venture (within the same two-year period and on the same terms as would apply to the buy out rights of a non-plan action party with respect to such plan action project) and to integrate the plan action project into the joint venture. 9. all affiliation agreements between the joint venture and operating companies (such as national operations and public telephone operators) in which the withdrawing party may have an equity interest on the withdrawal date shall remain in place in accordance with their terms and conditions. 10. if only one european party is the withdrawing party, the withdrawing european party shall have the rights and obligations of the withdrawing party contained in this transition plan. the non- withdrawing european party shall have the rights and obligations of a non-withdrawing party contained in this transition plan. ex-99.7 8 stockholders' agreement exhibit 7 stockholders' agreement among france telecom,

(c) subject to section 3.5 of this agreement, during a restricted period, if the company or any of its subsidiaries shall propose to transfer (other than in a lien transfer, an exempt long distance asset divestiture or in a sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets), in a transaction or a series of related transactions, long distance assets with a fair market value (calculated as at the date the company or such subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement to effect such transfer) that, when aggregated with the fair market value of all long distance assets previously so transferred after the date of the investment agreement (calculated in each case as of the date the company or such subsidiary entered into a definitive agreement to transfer such long distance assets), equals or exceeds 30 percent of the fair market value of the long distance assets of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (calculated as at the date the company or such subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement to effect such transfer), the company shall first deliver written notice (the "ld sale notice") to each of ft and dt stating that the company proposes to effect such a transfer and setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the long distance assets proposed to be transferred (the "specified long distance assets"), (ii) the price which the company expects to receive for such assets and (iii) the other material terms and conditions of transfer (including the assumption of liabilities, if any, by the transferee in connection therewith), provided that the company shall not be permitted to deliver such ld sale notice (and accordingly may not proceed with such transfer) unless a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved (unless such approval is not required pursuant to section 11.13), at a meeting of directors at which at least seven continuing directors are present, a transfer to ft and dt of the specified long distance assets at the price and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the ld sale notice. the company shall be entitled to effect such proposed transfer on terms no less favorable to the company than as set forth in the ld sale notice unless within 30 days of the delivery of the ld sale notice to ft and dt, both ft and dt notify the company in writing of their disapproval of such transfer. (d) upon receipt of notice to the company that both ft and dt have disapproved of such transfer (an "ld disapproval notice"), unless the company abandons the proposed transfer and notifies each of ft and dt of such abandonment within thirty business days of delivery of an ld disapproval notice (in which case the provisions of this article iii shall apply to any subsequent transfer of the specified long distance assets), ft and dt, or a qualified ld purchaser (in the case of an assignment pursuant to section 3.2) shall have the exclusive and, subject to section 3.2, irrevocable right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the specified long distance assets at the price and upon the terms and conditions (including the assumption of liabilities, if any, by the transferee in connection therewith) set forth in the ld sale notice. ft and dt, or a qualified ld purchaser (in case of an assignment pursuant to section 3.2), may exercise the right described in this section 3.1(d) by delivering notice to the company setting forth their irrevocable binding commitment to purchase the specified long distance assets at the price and on the terms and conditions set forth in the ld sale notice, subject to compliance with applicable laws and the receipt of all required material third party approvals and governmental approvals. such notice must be delivered within 90 days after the date of receipt of the ld sale notice, such period to be extended to the earlier to occur of (i) five business days following the latest to occur of the next regularly scheduled meetings of the supervisory boards of ft, dt and any qualified ld purchaser (in case of such an assignment), and (ii) 150 days following the date of receipt of the ld sale notice described above (such period, the "ld option period"). section 3.2. assignment of rights. at any time during the ld option period, upon 45 days' notice (an "assignment notice") to the company, ft and dt may assign the rights described in section 3.1(c) to one or more qualified ld purchasers, provided that ft and dt shall disclose to the company the identity of each qualified ld purchaser and such other relevant information regarding each such qualified ld purchaser as the company may reasonably request prior to assignment of such right. the company, in its sole discretion, may abandon any transfer described in its ld sale notice delivered pursuant to section 3.1(c) upon notice to each of ft and dt within 15 days after delivery of an assignment notice, in which case the rights described in sections 3.1(c) and (d) shall automatically be rescinded and of no effect notwithstanding ft's and dt's acceptance thereof, but in such event the company may not thereafter sell the specified long distance assets to such qualified ld purchaser and may not offer to engage in a transaction involving long distance assets substantially identical to the specified long distance assets for a period of one year following such abandonment. any such subsequent transaction within a restricted period shall be subject to this article iii. section 3.3. timing of disposition. if ft and dt fail to exercise the rights described in sections 3.1(c) and (d), the company may proceed to transfer the specified long distance assets, provided that it enters into a legally binding agreement, subject to standard terms and conditions for a purchase contract for assets of the type to be transferred, to transfer the specified long distance assets upon terms no less favorable to the company than those described in the ld sale notice delivered pursuant to section 3.1 within 150 days after the end of the ld option period. if the company does not obtain such a binding agreement within such time (or if it abandons such transfer pursuant to section 3.2), the company may not engage in a transaction involving substantially identical long distance assets for one year from the date of the ld sale notice. any such subsequent transaction within a restricted period shall be subject to this article iii. section 3.4. method of purchase. if ft and dt, or a qualified ld purchaser, as the case may be, exercise the right provided in section 3.1, the closing of the purchase of the specified long distance assets shall take place within 90 days after the date of exercise of such option, at the offices of debevoise & plimpton, 875 third avenue, new york, new york, at 10:00 a.m., new york time, or at such other date, time or place as the company and ft and dt, or the qualified ld purchaser, as the case may be, may agree, subject to the receipt of all necessary material governmental approvals, material third party approvals and, if required by applicable law, approval of the stockholders of the company. at such closing, the company shall deliver to ft and dt, or the qualified ld purchaser, as the case may be, bills of sale, assignments, endorsements, releases and such other documents and instruments as may be necessary, or, as determined by counsel to ft and dt, or the qualified ld purchaser, as the case may be, appropriate, to convey and vest in the buyer, title to each of the specified long distance assets to the extent, and in conformity with the terms of such sale, each as specified in the ld sale notice. simultaneously therewith, ft and dt, or the qualified ld purchaser, as the case may be, shall deliver to the company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank and account as the company may designate, a cash amount equal to the purchase price of the specified long distance assets, as set forth in the company's ld sale notice delivered pursuant to section 3.1(b). in addition to any other obligations which ft and dt may have at such closing, if a qualified ld purchaser is to purchase specified long distance assets at such closing, ft and dt shall certify to the company that such qualified ld purchaser meets the qualifications set forth in this agreement for being a qualified ld purchaser as of the date of such closing. if, notwithstanding the relevant parties' reasonable efforts, the required approvals described in this section 3.4 have not been received or the parties have not waived the requirement for any such approvals at the time the closing is scheduled to occur hereunder, the closing shall be postponed up to 180 days following the date of such originally scheduled closing or such other time as the parties to such transaction may agree. if by such time all such approvals have not been obtained or the requirement for any such approvals waived by the parties to such transaction, the rights of ft, dt and any qualified ld purchaser to purchase such specified long distance assets shall terminate and the company shall be entitled to proceed with the proposed transfer of such assets on the terms set forth in the ld sale notice. section 3.5. termination of rights. unless earlier terminated pursuant to article viii(b) hereof, the rights provided in this article iii and section 7.15 hereof shall terminate, and cease to be of any further force or effect, (a) upon the termination of the fundamental rights as to all outstanding shares of class a preference stock or upon the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of class a common stock into common stock, in either case pursuant to section 7(a) (or if all of such fundamental rights would have been so terminated or such shares would have been so converted except for the proviso thereto), 7(b), 7(c) or 7(g) of the class a provisions, (b) after the investment completion date, if the aggregate committed percentage of the class a holders shall be below ten percent for more than 180 consecutive days following a major issuance, (c) upon a sale of all of the venture interests of the sprint parties or the ft/dt parties pursuant to section 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 19.3, 20.6 or 20.11 of the joint venture agreement or on the date the joint venture is otherwise terminated, in each case other than due to an ft/dt joint venture termination or a corporation joint venture termination, or (d) prior to the investment completion date, if the outstanding class a preference stock has an aggregate liquidation value of less than $1.5 billion as a result of a transfer of shares of class a preference stock by a class a holder (other than a transfer contemplated by section 7.4(b)(i)(y) hereof). in addition, any rights provided in this article iii and section 7.15 hereof shall be suspended and may not be exercised during any period of time in which the rights provided to the class a holders under section 4(b) of the class a provisions are suspended pursuant to clause (iv) of section 7(b) of the class a provisions. article iv provisions concerning change of control - --------------------------------------- section 4.1. sale of assets or control. so long as shares of class a stock are outstanding, but subject to article viii of this agreement, if the company

representing more than 35 percent of the voting power of the company or to sell control of the company or to effect a merger or other business combination, which would result in a person (other than ft or dt or any of their qualified subsidiaries) holding voting securities of the resulting entity representing 35 percent or more of the voting power of such entity, the company shall conduct such transaction in accordance with reasonable procedures to be determined by the board of directors, and permit ft and dt to participate in that process on a basis no less favorable than that granted any other participant. section 4.2. required share purchases. if a person other than ft, dt or any of their respective affiliates makes a tender offer for voting securities of the company representing not less than 35 percent of the voting power of the company and the terms of such tender offer do not permit the class a holders to sell an equal or greater percentage of their shares as the other holders of voting securities of the company are permitted to sell taking into account any proration, then upon the purchase by such person of securities representing not less than 35 percent of the voting power of the company in such tender offer, ft, dt and their qualified subsidiaries, as a group, shall have the option, exercisable upon delivery of written notice to the company (or its successor) at any time within 30 days after the termination of the period during which tenders may be made into such tender offer, to sell to the company, at a price per share (or, if the tender offer period terminates, shares of class a preference stock are outstanding and the investment completion date has not occurred, at a price per number of shares of class a preference stock equal to the price per share that would apply to shares of common stock that would be issuable in respect of the related class a conversion shares (assuming that, if the conversion price shall not have been fixed, the conversion price is equal to the target price)) equal to the price per share of common stock offered pursuant to the tender offer, all but not less than all, of the shares that they were unable to tender on the same basis as the other shareholders, provided, that the class a holders shall have no rights pursuant to this section 4.2 if, at the date of termination of the period during which tenders may be made into such tender offer, the class a holders have a right to receive in exchange for all the shares of class a stock publicly traded securities with an aggregate fair market value, and/or cash in an amount, not less than the aggregate price per share of common stock (or per that number of related class a conversion shares, as the case may be) paid pursuant to the tender offer in

date of the issuance which gave rise to such equity purchase right and (ii) in the case of the class a preference stock, the product of the market price of a share of common stock on such date of issuance, multiplied by the number of class a conversion shares related to one share of class a preference stock outstanding immediately prior to such purchase; and (c) if after the investment completion date, the company shall issue (or sell from treasury) shares of common stock in respect of the exercise of stock options, warrants or other rights (except rights issued pursuant to the

(b) (i) if at any time the company should invoke its right to redeem its capital stock, the company shall unless prohibited by applicable law first designate for redemption capital stock other than shares of class a stock, before designating for redemption any shares of class a stock, provided that prior to the fixed closing date (x) the company shall have no right to redeem shares of class a preference stock pursuant to the articles to the extent that such redemption would reduce the aggregate liquidation value represented by the outstanding class a preference stock to below $1.5 billion, but (y) in such circumstance, if the votes represented by the outstanding class a preference stock exceed 20% of the aggregate voting power of the company, the company shall have the right to purchase from the class a holders for a per share price equal to the liquidation preference thereof (as adjusted to comply with the requirements of article ix hereof) such number of shares of class a preference stock as in the reasonable good faith judgment of the board of directors is necessary to comply with the requirements of section 310, provided that (a) the company may purchase shares only to the extent the outstanding class a preference stock represents in excess of 20% of the aggregate voting power of the company, (b) this agreement, the investment agreement and the articles as amended by the amendment shall be modified so as to maintain the rights of the parties hereunder and thereunder (including, without limitation, appropriate modifications for durations of disapproval rights) and (c) the company shall not purchase any shares from the class a holders pursuant to this clause (y) unless a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved (unless such approval is not required pursuant to section 11.13), at a meeting of directors at which at least seven continuing directors are present, such purchase of class a preference stock from the class a holders. (ii) if the company issues redemption securities in full or partial payment of the redemption price for shares of class a stock in a circumstance in which section 7.4(b)(i) hereof or section 2(f) of article sixth of the articles entitled "general provisions relating to all stock" requires adjustment under article ix of this agreement, then principal payments under such redemption securities shall be adjusted to comply with the requirements of article ix such that the class a holders shall receive an amount equal to the principal amount of such redemption securities. (c) the company shall take all reasonable measures to permit the class a holders to obtain or maintain their percentage ownership interest in accordance with applicable laws of the united states, including applying for a waiver of the restrictions on alien ownership set forth in section 310 if there is a reasonable possibility of obtaining such a waiver.

(iii) each class a holder selling surplus shares shall, promptly upon the conclusion of the surplus shares sale, deliver to the company a notice stating that such surplus shares sale has been concluded and indicating the total amount of consideration received therefrom (the "total realized amount") for the surplus shares sold in such sale. following receipt of such notice, the company shall pay (a "supplementary payment") to each class a holder selling surplus shares the excess, if any, of the aggregate formula price applicable to such surplus shares over the total realized amount (in each case as modified to comply with the requirements of section 9.2). section 7.5. joint action by ft and dt.

provisions relating to all stock" or section 3(a) of the class a provisions (a "company purchase") in the context where such sections provide that such purchase price or redemption price be modified in accordance with this article ix and as a result thereof such class a holder (together with any class a holder described in section 9.2, an "indemnitee") incurs u.s. federal income taxes in excess of the u.s. federal income taxes it would have incurred had it sold such shares to a third party unrelated to the company or its affiliates at the applicable price set forth in such section or article (such sale to an unrelated third party, an "unrelated party sale" and such excess u.s. federal income taxes, "excess taxes"), the company shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnitee on an after-tax basis from and against such excess taxes. for purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxes that would have been incurred in an unrelated party sale shall be net of any refund of taxes that would have been obtained had withholding under section 1445 of the code (or any successor provision) applied to such unrelated party sale. if excess taxes are imposed through withholding at the source, the company shall pay, in connection with the applicable company purchase, such additional amounts as may be necessary such that after deduction or withholding of all such excess taxes (including taxes imposed on such additional amounts), the indemnitee receives the amount it would have received had no such excess taxes been imposed. the company shall promptly furnish to the applicable indemnitee an appropriate receipt for the payment of any taxes imposed through withholding. section 9.2. indemnification for supplementary payments. if the company makes a supplementary payment to a class a holder in respect of shares disposed of pursuant to section 7.4(d) of this agreement or a requested sale supplementary payment pursuant to section 3(a) of the class a provisions and as a result thereof such class a holder incurs taxes in connection with the transaction contemplated in such section 7.4(d) or such section 3(a), as the case may be, in excess of the taxes it would have incurred had such class a holder sold such shares in an unrelated party sale for the formula price in the case of a transaction contemplated by section 7.4 or for the aggregate liquidation preference of such shares in the case of a transaction contemplated by such section 3(a) (such excess taxes, "section 9.2 excess taxes"), the company shall indemnify and hold harmless such class a holder on an after-tax basis from and against such section 9.2 excess taxes. for purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxes that would have been incurred in an unrelated party sale at the formula price or at the aggregate liquidation preference, as the case may be, shall be net of any refund of taxes that would have been obtained had withholding under section 1445 of the code (or any successor provision) applied to such unrelated party sale. section 9.3. rebate of indemnity. within nine months after the end of each of the five consecutive taxable years of an indemnitee starting with the taxable year in which the company has paid any amounts pursuant to sections 9.1 or 9.2 in respect of such indemnitee (a "company tax payment"), such indemnitee shall determine whether it is in a better after-tax economic position as a result of such company tax payment than it would have been in had such indemnitee (a) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.1, sold the shares purchased by the company in an unrelated party sale or (b) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.2, sold the shares disposed of pursuant to section 7.4(d) of this agreement or section 3(a) of the class a provisions, as the case may be, in an unrelated party sale at the formula price in the case of a disposition pursuant to section 7.4(d) or at the aggregate liquidation preference of such shares in the case of a disposition pursuant to such section 3(a) (the amount of such difference in after-tax economic positions under the preceding clauses (a) or (b), a "windfall benefit"). the applicable indemnitee shall promptly thereafter pay to the company all or a portion of such windfall benefit so that, after taking into account all prior such payments and the tax consequences of making all such payments, such indemnitee is in the same after-tax economic position that it would have been in had it (a) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.1, sold the shares purchased by the company in an unrelated party sale or (b) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.2, sold the shares disposed of pursuant to section 7.4(d) of this agreement in an unrelated party sale at the formula price, or at the aggregate liquidation preference of such shares in the case of a disposition pursuant to section 3(a) of the class a provisions. in the case of a windfall benefit relating to an increase in the tax basis in shares of class a stock of an indemnitee attributable to a company tax payment (such windfall benefit, a "basis windfall"), the preceding sentence shall be applied without regard to the five year time limitation contained in the first sentence of this paragraph, provided, however, that no indemnitee shall be required after the five year limit contained in the first sentence of this paragraph to pay any amount to the company on account of such basis windfall unless the company notifies such indemnitee in writing of the existence of such basis windfall within three months after the date such indemnitee disposes of shares in a transaction in which such basis windfall results in a savings of u.s. taxes. in no event shall the amount payable by any indemnitee to the company under this paragraph exceed the amount of the company tax payment. if any applicable indemnitee subsequently determines (within five years after the end of the taxable year of the company in which the indemnitee has paid a windfall benefit to the company) that the amount of such windfall benefit has been reduced because of an audit adjustment, disallowance of tax credits, a carryback or carryforward of losses or credits or for any other reason, the company shall promptly after notification thereof make a reconciling payment to such indemnitee in an amount necessary so that such indemnitee is in the same after-tax economic position, after taking into account the tax consequences of such reconciling payment, that such indemnitee would have been in had it (a) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.1, sold the shares purchased by the company in an unrelated party sale or (b) in the case of a company tax payment pursuant to section 9.2, sold the shares disposed of pursuant to section 7.4(d) of this agreement or section 3(a) of the class a provisions in an unrelated party sale at the formula price in the case of a disposition pursuant to such section 7.4(d) or the aggregate liquidation preference of such shares in the case of a disposition pursuant to such section 3(a). section 9.4. exclusions from indemnity. notwithstanding sections 9.1 and 9.2, the company shall not be required to indemnify an indemnitee under this agreement for any portion of excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes to the extent that such portion would not be imposed on such indemnitee but for one or more of the following events: (a) the failure of such indemnitee to qualify for the benefits of the applicable income tax treaty between the united states and the country of the indemnitee's residence; (b) the failure of such indemnitee to supply the company with any form or other similar document that it is entitled to supply and that is required to obtain or claim available benefits of an applicable income tax treaty or relief that may be provided under the code with respect to excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes, provided, that this section 9.4(b) shall not apply unless the company requests from such indemnitee such form or similar document in writing within a reasonable period of time before the relevant company purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment takes place; (c) the imposition of excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes on a transferee or assignee of an original class a holder's shares, but only to the extent the amount of excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes required to be paid by the company exceeds the amount of excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes that would have been required to be paid by the company absent any transfer of such original class a holder's shares, provided, that this section 9.4(c) shall not apply if the transferee or assignee is a qualified subsidiary and has held such shares for at least six months prior to the date such qualified subsidiary first undertook those discussions or negotiations that resulted in the company's right to purchase such shares pursuant to section 2.5, has held such shares prior to the date that the fcc has requested that the company reduce its foreign ownership pursuant to section 310 in the case of a transaction under section 7.4, or in the case of a transaction under section 3(a) of the class a provisions has held such shares prior to the earlier of (x) the date on which all conditions necessary to establish the conversion date as a date certain pursuant to section 3(a) of the class a provisions have been satisfied, and (y) the date on which the company notifies each of ft and dt in good faith that it is reasonably likely that upon conversion, the shares of class a preference stock will convert into class a common stock or common stock representing in excess of 20% of the voting power of the company (for purposes of this section 9.4(c), a share received upon a conversion shall be considered held by a qualified subsidiary during the period such qualified subsidiary held the share that was surrendered in connection with such conversion); (d) penalties arising solely from actions taken by such indemnitee in connection with unrelated transactions; and (e) the excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes are imposed on the company purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment solely because such indemnitee conducts unrelated activities in the united states sufficient to cause such indemnitee to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the united states for u.s. federal income tax purposes and such indemnitee's income or gain from the company purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment to be treated as effectively connected with that u.s. trade or business. section 9.5. consequences of assignment. if the company assigns to a third party its rights hereunder to effect a company purchase, the company shall remain liable (and such third party shall not be liable) under the provisions of this article with respect to the purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment by the third party (taking into account the actual tax effect to the indemnitee of such third party purchase or supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment in determining the taxes incurred in excess of the taxes the indemnitee would have incurred had the shares been sold in an unrelated party sale), and the "excess taxes" and section 9.2 excess taxes in such determination shall be computed by taking into account not only u.s. taxes but also any taxes imposed by any other jurisdiction to the extent such taxes would not have been imposed absent such an assignment. section 9.6. verification. the chief tax officer of any party hereto making or seeking a payment pursuant to this article ix shall furnish to the other applicable party hereto a written statement describing in reasonable detail the taxes which are the subject of such payment and the computation of the amount so payable. in case of any dispute among the applicable parties hereto regarding the amount of any payment under this article ix, the applicable parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. notwithstanding section 11.5(b) of this agreement, if such dispute cannot be resolved by the parties hereto, then such dispute shall be referred to an independent accounting firm of international standing reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto in question. the decision of such accounting firm shall be conclusive absent manifest error. the cost of employing such accounting firm shall be borne in equal parts by the parties to such dispute. section 9.7. contest rights.

(b) if the company provides an indemnitee with a written statement regarding the manner in which the company shall characterize a company purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, such indemnitee shall thereafter treat such company purchase, supplementary payment or requested sale supplementary payment for u.s. federal income tax purposes in a manner consistent with such characterization by the company, provided that such indemnitee shall have no such obligation of consistent characterization if such indemnitee receives an opinion from u.s. tax counsel of national standing to the effect that such characterization by the indemnitee lacks substantial authority. (c) if an indemnitee receives written notice from the u.s. internal revenue service (including, without limitation, in a preliminary or "30-day" letter) that such indemnitee is liable for excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes, such indemnitee shall promptly notify the company in writing of such fact and shall permit the company to assume control over the handling, disposition and settlement of the excess taxes issue or section 9.2 excess taxes issue at the examination, administrative and judicial levels in the u.s. such indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in all meetings with the u.s. internal revenue service relating to the excess taxes issue or section 9.2 excess taxes issue and to review and consult on all submissions to the u.s. internal revenue service or any court with respect to the excess taxes issue or section 9.2 excess taxes issue. such indemnitee shall cooperate with the company, as reasonably requested, in connection with any such examination or administrative or judicial proceedings, including, without limitation, by way of signing and filing protests, petitions, notices of appeal and court pleadings and executing powers of attorney to enable the company to represent the interests of the indemnitee in, and to assume control over, relevant examinations or proceedings insofar as they relate to excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes; provided, however, that expenses incurred by such indemnitee in connection with actions taken at the request of the company shall be reimbursed to such indemnitee by the company on an after-tax basis. the company shall be entitled to employ counsel of its choice in connection with any of the matters described in this article and shall bear all expenses associated with the employment of such counsel. the provisions of this paragraph shall also apply to a claim for refund of excess taxes or section 9.2 excess taxes paid or withheld. notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 9.7(c), if the company assumes control over an excess taxes issue or section 9.2 excess taxes issue at the examination, administrative or judicial levels, the company shall not be entitled to settle or compromise any such claim except upon the written consent of the applicable indemnitee. if an applicable indemnitee fails to grant such consent, the company shall not be required to pay any amounts in excess of the amount it would have paid had such indemnitee consented to such settlement or compromise, and such indemnitee shall bear any further cost or expense of contesting such excess taxes issue or section 9.2 excess taxes issue. article x u.s. real property tax matters - ------------------------------ section 10.1. notification. the company shall notify each class a holder whenever a firpta determination shall be required under the applicable rules of the code and regulations thereunder. such notification shall, to the extent practical, be made sufficiently far in advance of any date on which the actions described in section 10.3 will be necessary so as to allow for reasonable time for the performance of the legal, accounting and valuation analyses described in this article x. section 10.2. control of firpta determination. if one or more class a holders notify the company that they desire to control a firpta determination (each a "notifying class a holder"): (a) the company shall cooperate fully with such notifying class a holders and their legal, accounting and valuation advisors with respect to such firpta determination. such cooperation shall include making available information and knowledgeable personnel as reasonably requested as well as making reasonable representations necessary for such advisors to render their opinions and judgments described in this article x, to the extent that the company may make such representations in its good faith judgment. the company shall not, however, be obligated to make any representations as to the fair market value of assets;

(iii) (1) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 2, but subject to paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section 2(a)(iii) and the proviso set forth at the end of the first sentence of section 2(a)(i) of this article fifth (the "section 2(a) proviso"), if the aggregate percentage ownership interest of the class a holders is 20% or greater, the class a holders at all times shall have the right to elect not less than 20% of the total number of directors, provided that, if the section 2(a) proviso prevents the class a holders from electing at least 20% of the total number of directors under such circumstances, this corporation shall increase the total number of directors to a number not greater than 20 if such increase would enable the class a holders to elect at least 20% of the total number of directors as increased. (2) the provisions of section 2(a)(iii)(1) of this article fifth (the "section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions") shall terminate and be of no force and effect (a "nullification") unless reinstated in accordance with section 2(a)(iii)(5), if either: (a) this corporation delivers an opinion of nationally-recognized u.s. tax counsel to the effect that the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are, with respect to both ft and dt, either not a necessary condition or not a sufficient condition to secure any treaty benefit and within 90 days of the delivery of such opinion by this corporation there is not delivered to this corporation by ft or dt an opinion of nationally-recognized u.s. tax counsel concluding that such provisions are a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for either ft or dt to secure a treaty benefit, or (b) this corporation provides written notice to ft and dt in which it agrees to accord ft and dt those treaty benefits to which ft and dt would be entitled if the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions were in effect (the "continuing treaty benefits") and to indemnify ft and dt on an after-tax basis against (a) any liability arising out of according ft and dt continuing treaty benefits to the extent such liability would not arise if the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions were in effect and (b) the loss of those continuing treaty benefits that this corporation cannot directly accord; provided that this corporation by written notice to ft and dt may revoke and withdraw such agreement to accord such treaty benefits and to provide such indemnification following the date of such notice and upon delivery of such notice the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall again become effective. notwithstanding any revocation or withdrawal pursuant to the proviso contained in the immediately preceding sentence, this corporation shall continue to indemnify ft and dt on an after-tax basis against any loss of treaty benefits to which ft or dt, as the case may be, would have been entitled had the nullification described in this section 2(a)(iii)(2)(b) not taken place. if a nullification occurs under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 2(a)(iii)(2), then after the date of any such nullification, and until such time as a change in facts or applicable law requires a different result, this corporation shall accord ft and dt treaty benefits under the relevant treaties between the united states and france and the united states and germany, but only to the extent ft or dt, as the case may be, would have been entitled to claim such benefits had such nullification not occurred. (3) in addition to its rights under section 2(a)(iii)(2), this corporation shall have the right, from time to time after the investment completion date, to deliver to each of ft and dt a written notice requesting that the chief tax officer of each of ft and dt certify that ft, in the case of the request furnished to ft, and dt, in the case of the request furnished to dt, is eligible to claim at least one treaty benefit, and that such chief tax officer provide this corporation with other facts and information reasonably requested by this corporation that are reasonably necessary for this corporation to determine whether the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are a sufficient condition or a necessary condition to secure at least one treaty benefit. unless within 60 days of delivery of any such request, either ft or dt delivers such requested certificate to this corporation, and provides such requested facts or information, the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall terminate and be of no force or effect, unless reinstated in accordance with section 2(a)(iii)(5). (4) if ft and dt determine, after the investment completion date, that the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are, with respect to both ft and dt, either not a necessary condition or not a sufficient condition to secure at least one treaty benefit, ft and dt shall deliver to this corporation a certification to such effect, and the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall terminate and be of no force or effect, unless reinstated in accordance with section 2(a)(iii)(5). (5) each of ft and dt shall have the right, at any time after the date the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are nullified pursuant to paragraph (a) (but not paragraph (b)) of clause (2) or clause (3) or (4) of this section 2(a)(iii), to deliver to this corporation a certificate signed by the chief tax officer of either ft or dt to the effect that ft or dt, as the case may be, is eligible to claim a treaty benefit and an opinion of nationally-recognized u.s. tax counsel to the effect that the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are again a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for any of ft or dt to secure a treaty benefit. upon the delivery of any such certificate and opinion, the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall again become effective unless and until they become ineffective pursuant to the other provisions of this section 2(a)(iii). (6) for purposes of this section 2(a)(iii), the term "ft" shall include any qualified subsidiary of ft organized under the laws of france and the term "dt" shall include any qualified subsidiary of dt organized under the laws of germany. (7) the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall be a "necessary condition" with respect to any treaty benefit if ft or dt would not be entitled to claim such treaty benefit unless such section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are in effect. (8) the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions shall be a "sufficient condition" with respect to any treaty benefit if ft and dt will otherwise fulfill all other relevant conditions to claiming such treaty benefit if the section 2(a)(iii)(1) provisions are in effect. (b) election of directors by other holders. -------------------------------------- (i) subject to clause (ii) below, the holders of common stock shall have the right to elect that number of directors equal to the excess of (x) the total number of directors over (y) the sum of the number of directors the class a holders are entitled to elect and the number of directors, if any, that the holders of preferred stock, voting separately by class or series, are entitled to elect in accordance with the provisions of article sixth of these articles of incorporation. the class a holders shall have no right to vote for directors under this section 2(b)(i). (ii) so long as section 310 remains in effect, under no circumstances shall an alien director elected by the holders of common stock be qualified to serve as a director if the number of aliens who would then be serving as members of the board of directors, including such elected alien, would constitute more than the maximum number of aliens permitted by section 310 on the board of directors. (iii) the directors (other than the directors elected by the class a holders and any directors elected by the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock having the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors) shall be divided into three classes, designated class i, class ii and class iii, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. the number of class i, class ii and class iii directors shall consist, as nearly as practicable, of one third of the total number of directors (other than the directors elected by the class a holders and any directors elected by the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock having the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors). at each annual meeting of stockholders of this corporation after the initial issuance date, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. (iv) whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of these articles of incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this article fifth unless expressly provided by such terms. 3. change in number of directors. if the number of directors (other than directors elected by class a holders and any directors elected by the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock having the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors) is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible. 4. term of office. -------------- (a) each director shall be elected for a three year term. a director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify to serve, subject to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. (b) any vacancy on the board of directors (whether resulting from an increase in the total number of directors, the departure of one of the directors or otherwise) may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors elected by the same class or classes of stockholders which would be entitled to elect the director who would fill such vacancy if the annual meeting of stockholders of this corporation were held on the date on which such vacancy occurred, provided that at any time when there is only one such director so elected and then serving, such director may fill such vacancy and, provided, further, that at any time when there are no such directors then serving, the stockholders of the class or classes entitled to elect the director who will fill such vacancy shall have the right to fill such vacancy and, provided, further, that, so long as any class a stock is outstanding, any vacancy to be filled by the director or directors elected by the holders of common stock may not be filled with a person who, upon his election, would not be an independent director or would be an alien, as the case may be, if the effect of such election would be that less than a majority of the board of directors following such election would be independent directors, or that the number of aliens who would then be serving on the board of directors would constitute more than the maximum number of aliens permitted on the board of directors under section 310. (c) any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors of such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of the directors of that class, but, except as provided in section 2(a)(ii) of this article fifth, in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. 5. rights, powers, duties, rules and procedures; amendment of bylaws. (a) except to the extent prohibited by law or as set forth in these articles of incorporation or the bylaws, the board of directors shall have the right (which, to the extent exercised, shall be exclusive) to establish the rights, powers, duties, rules and procedures that from time to time shall govern the board of directors and each of its members, including, without limitation, the vote required for any action by the board of directors, and that from time to time shall affect the directors' power to manage the business and affairs of this corporation. no bylaw shall be adopted by stockholders which shall impair or impede the implementation of the foregoing. (b) the board of directors is expressly authorized and empowered, in the manner provided in the bylaws of this corporation, to adopt, amend and repeal the bylaws of this corporation in any respect to the full extent permitted by the general corporation code not inconsistent with the laws of the general corporation code or with these articles of incorporation, provided that the following provisions of the bylaws may not be amended, altered, repealed or made inoperative or ineffective by adoption of other provisions to the bylaws without the affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of class a stock then outstanding, voting separately as a class, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, the notice of which shall have specified or summarized the proposed amendment, alteration or repeal of the bylaws: article iii, sections 2, 4, 5, 8 and 9; article iv, sections 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12; article vi, section 1; and article vii, sections 1 and 2. 6. removal; changes in status; preferred stock directors. ----------------------------------------------------- (a) except as provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section 6, a director (other than a director elected by the class a holders or by the holders of any class or series of preferred stock having the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors) may be removed only for cause. no director so removed may be reinstated for so long as the cause for removal continues to exist. such removal for cause may be effected only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of the class or classes of stockholders which were entitled to elect such director. (b) a director elected by the holders of the class a stock may be removed with or without cause. if removed for cause, no director so removed may be reinstated for so long as the cause for removal continues to exist. removal may be effected with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of class a stock or with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of the common stock, the class a stock and other capital stock of this corporation entitled to general voting power, voting together as a single class. (c) if a director elected by the holders of common stock who was not, at the time of his election to the board of directors, an alien, subsequently becomes an alien, the effect of which would be that the number of aliens who would then be serving as members of the board of directors, including the director who changed status, would constitute more than the maximum number of aliens permitted on the board of directors under section 310, such director shall upon his change in status automatically and without further action be removed from the board of directors. (d) so long as any class a stock is outstanding, if an independent director elected by the holders of common stock subsequently ceases to be an independent director, the effect of which would be that the independent directors who would then be serving as members of the board of directors would not constitute a majority of the board of directors, such director shall automatically and without further action upon his change in status be removed from the board of directors. (e) (i) so long as any class a stock is outstanding, if a director elected by the holders of any class or series of preferred stock having the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors (a "preferred stock director") is an alien, or after election becomes an alien, the effect of which would be that the number of aliens who would then be serving as members of the board of directors (including such preferred stock director) would constitute more than the maximum number of aliens permitted on the board of directors under section 310, the total number of directors shall automatically and without further action be increased by the smallest number necessary to enable the class a holders (and the directors elected by the class a holders in the case of vacancies) to elect aliens as directors to the fullest extent that the class a holders are entitled to elect directors pursuant to section 2(a) of this article fifth without violating the requirements of section 310. (ii) so long as any class a stock is outstanding, if a preferred stock director is not an independent director, or after election ceases to be an independent director, the effect of which would be that the independent directors who would then be serving as members of the board of directors would not constitute a majority of the board of directors, the total number of directors shall automatically and without further action be increased by the smallest number necessary so that the number of directors then serving who are not independent directors (including such preferred stock director and any vacancies which the holders of class a stock have a right to fill) constitute less than a majority of the board of directors. 7. definitions. certain capitalized terms used in this article fifth without definition shall have the meanings set forth in section 12 of the class a provisions. 3. the introductory paragraph to article sixth of the articles of incorporation of this corporation is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows: the total number of shares of capital stock which may be issued by this corporation is 2,020,000,000, of which 500,000,000 shares shall be class a common stock with a par value of $2.50 per share (hereinafter, the "class a common stock");

(iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section 3(a), if after the cellular spin-off date shares of class a preference stock that previously were not convertible because the cellular spin-off date had not occurred otherwise would be converted pursuant to this section 3(a) into class a common stock or common stock at a conversion price greater than 135% of the average sprint price for the 20 trading days ended on the tenth business day prior to the conversion date, the class a holders may elect, by delivery of a notice to this corporation executed by or on behalf of all class a holders, at least two business days prior to the conversion date, to defer such conversion until the first business day following the thirtieth day after the occurrence of a period of 20 trading days in which the conversion price is less than or equal to 135% of the average sprint price over such period or until the class a holders shall otherwise elect, by delivery of a notice to this corporation executed by or on behalf of each class a holder, to convert ten business days after delivery of such notice the shares of class a preference stock at the conversion price set forth in section 3(b) without regard to this clause (iii). if the class a holders elect to defer conversion in accordance with this section 3(a)(iii), the shares of class a preference stock shall not be subject to conversion pursuant to section 3(b)(v) or redemption pursuant to section 3(c). (b) the conversion price of the class a preference stock shall initially be established at the time and at the price set forth below in this section 3(b) (such conversion price to be subject in each case to adjustment as provided in the class a provisions): (i) if the average sprint price determined at the initial issuance date is within the sprint price range, the conversion price shall be fixed on the initial issuance date at the target price.

(3) at any time prior to the second anniversary of the initial issuance date, (i) if the cellular spin-off date has occurred, this corporation or the class a holders, by notice delivered, in the case of this corporation to each class a holder, and in the case of the class a holders, to this corporation by or on behalf of each class a holder, the first such notice delivered to be effective, may elect to fix the conversion price, effective on the date of such notice, at (a) if the class a holders make such election, the new target price or (b) if this corporation makes such election, the minimum price (determined by reference to such average sprint price for the 20 consecutive trading day period ended five days before the date of such election, provided that, if the cellular spin-off date has occurred fewer than 25 trading days prior to the delivery of such notice, the conversion price shall be determined by reference to such average sprint price for the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on the trading day following the cellular spin- off date and the conversion date shall be fixed five days after the end of such 20-day period), provided that this corporation may only deliver such a notice if a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved, at a meeting at which at least seven continuing directors are present, fixing the conversion price on the date of such notice at the minimum price, unless a fair price condition has been satisfied; and (ii) if the cellular spin-off date has not occurred, either this corporation or the class a holders, by notice delivered, in the case of this corporation, to each class a holder, and in the case of the class a holders, to this corporation by or on behalf of each class a holder, the first such notice delivered to be effective, may elect to fix the conversion price, effective on the date of such notice, at (a) if the class a holders make such election, the target price, or (b) if this corporation makes such election, the minimum price (determined by reference to the average sprint price for the 20 consecutive trading day period ended five days before the date of such election), provided that this corporation may only deliver such a notice if a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved, at a meeting at which at least seven continuing directors are present, fixing the conversion price on the date of such notice at the minimum price, unless a fair price condition has been satisfied; (4) (a) if neither the cellular spin-off date nor the conversion of all of the outstanding class a preference stock into class a common stock or common stock has occurred prior to the second anniversary of the initial issuance date and the conversion price has not previously been fixed, the conversion price will, automatically on such second anniversary, become fixed at the minimum price, determined by reference to the average sprint price for the 20 consecutive trading days ended five business days before such second anniversary; provided that, if such average sprint price is then below the second anniversary lower threshold sprint price, this corporation may elect to defer the fixing of the conversion price, by notice delivered to each class a holder within such five business day period, so that if, at any time during the following three years, the average sprint price shall be at least the second anniversary lower threshold sprint price (if the cellular spin-off date shall not have occurred) or 93.308% of the new lower threshold sprint price (if the cellular spin-off date shall have so occurred), the conversion price shall be fixed at 93.308% of the target price (if the cellular spin-off date shall not have so occurred) and 93.308% of the new target price (if the cellular spin-off date shall have so occurred), provided that if the cellular spin-off date shall have occurred prior to the fifth anniversary of the initial issuance date and the average sprint price during any spin-off trading period is at or above the modified new lower threshold, the conversion price shall be fixed, effective on the day following such spin-off trading period, at 93.308% of the new target price. at any time during such three year period, this corporation may elect, by notice delivered to each class a holder, to cause the conversion price to be fixed, effective on the date of such notice, at the minimum price (determined by reference to the average sprint price for the 20 trading days ended five business days before the date of such election, provided that, if the cellular spin-off date shall occur during the last 20 trading day period before the second anniversary of the initial issuance date, all calculations to have been based upon such period under this clause (a) shall be deferred until the first 20 consecutive trading day period after the cellular spin-off date, on which such calculations shall be then based), provided that this corporation may only deliver such a notice if a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved, at a meeting at which at least seven continuing directors are present, fixing the conversion price on the date of such notice at the minimum price, unless a fair price condition has been satisfied, and ft and dt may elect by notice delivered to this corporation by or on behalf of each class a holder to cause the conversion price to be fixed, effective on the date of such notice, at a price equal to 93.308% of the target price (if the cellular spin-off date shall have not occurred) and 93.308% of the new target price (if the cellular spin-off date shall have occurred), the first such notice to be effective; (b) if, prior to such second anniversary, the cellular spin-off date has occurred, but the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of class a preference stock has not taken place and the conversion price has not previously been fixed, the conversion price will, automatically on such second anniversary, become fixed at the minimum price, determined by reference to the average sprint price for the 20 consecutive trading days ended five business days before the second anniversary of the initial issuance date, provided that if such average sprint price is then below 93.308% of the new lower threshold sprint price, this corporation may elect to defer the fixing of the conversion price by notice delivered to each class a holder within such five business day period so that if, at any time during the following three years, the average sprint price shall be at least equal to 93.308% of the new lower threshold sprint price, the conversion price will be fixed at 93.308% of the new target price. at any time during such three year period, this corporation may elect by notice delivered to each class a holder at any time after the fifth business day following the end of the 20 trading day period starting on the first trading day following the cellular spin-off date, to cause the conversion price to be fixed, effective on the date of such notice, at the minimum price (determined by reference to the average sprint price for the 20 trading days ended five business days before the date of such election), provided that this corporation may only deliver such a notice if a majority of the continuing directors shall have first approved, at a meeting at which at least seven continuing directors are present, fixing the conversion price on the date of such notice at the minimum price, unless a fair price condition has been satisfied, and the class a holders may elect, by notice to that effect delivered to this corporation by or on behalf of each class a holder, at any time to cause the conversion price to be fixed effective on the date of such notice, at a price equal to 93.308% of the new target price, the first such notice delivered to be effective. (iv) if the conversion price has been fixed before the cellular spin-off date, effective at the cellular spin-off date, the conversion price fixed with reference to the maximum price, minimum price or target price, as the case may be, automatically and without notice, will be re-fixed with reference to the new maximum price, new minimum price or new target price, respectively, the calculation of such new minimum price or such new maximum price to be based on the average sprint price used to calculate the related maximum price or minimum price, as the case may be. (v) if the conversion price has not been fixed by a date which is five years after the initial issuance date and this corporation shall not have redeemed all of the outstanding shares of class a preference stock as required under section 3(c), the class a preference stock shall be convertible only at the election of the class a holders made at any time after the end of ten business days after the 60th day after such fifth anniversary, by notice to that effect delivered to this corporation by or on behalf of each class a holder, such conversion to occur five business days after delivery of such notice, at a conversion price equal to 135% of the average sprint price for the 20 trading days ended on the trading day five trading days prior to such conversion. (vi) upon the issuance of shares of class a preference stock at the optional shares closing (as defined in the investment agreement) or as provided in section 7(i) of the class a provisions or article v or vi of the stockholders' agreement, the conversion price shall be adjusted further to be the quotient of (x) the sum of (i) the number of outstanding shares of class a preference stock prior to such issuance times the conversion price of such shares prior to this adjustment and (ii) the number of such shares received upon such issuance times the purchase price thereof, divided by (y) the total number of shares of class a preference stock outstanding after such issuance.

(3) successful defense of action. notwithstanding, and without limitation of, any other provision of this section 10, to the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of this sub-section (a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such director, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
