of directors. in the event that the infinity world group acquires at least twelve percent (12%) of the total outstanding shares, infinity world will have the right to designate a number of nominees

outstanding shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. while none of the infinity world group has any current plans, proposals or agreements to dispose of any shares, the infinity world

(a) upon the occurrence of any acceleration event, the collateral agent (and, as specified herein, the disposition agents as sub-agents) may exercise on behalf of the secured parties all the rights of a secured party under the uniform commercial code (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) and, in addition, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, the disposition agents shall have the right, subject to the right of first refusal provision and the buy-out option provision, to sell all or any part of the collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker&#146;s board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the disposition agents may deem satisfactory. any initial bank giving notice pursuant to section 6(a) or 6(b) of the relevant isda master agreement (the &#147;

and (iv) with the consent of all the initial banks, to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto. (c) upon any delivery or sale of all or any part of any collateral made either under the power of delivery or sale given hereunder or under judgment or decree in any judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for the enforcement of this agreement, each agent is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of pledgor, in the name and stead of pledgor, to make all necessary deeds, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, transfer or conveyance of the property, and all instructions and entitlement orders in respect of the property thus delivered or sold. for that purpose each agent may execute all such documents, instruments, instructions and entitlement orders. this power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an interest, and pledgor hereby ratifies and confirms that which pledgor&#146;s attorney acting under such power, or such attorney&#146;s successors or agents, shall lawfully do by virtue of this agreement. if so requested by any agent, by any initial bank or by any buyer of the collateral or a portion thereof, pledgor shall further ratify and confirm any such delivery or sale by executing and delivering to such agent, to such initial bank or to such buyer or buyers at the expense of pledgor all proper deeds, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, conveyance or transfer, releases, instructions and entitlement orders as may be designated in any such request. 21 (d) upon the occurrence of any acceleration event, the collateral agent (and, in the use of eligible collateral, the disposition agents) may and, at the direction of any initial bank shall, subject to the right of first refusal provision, proceed to realize upon the security interest in the collateral against any one or more of the types of collateral, at any time, as such agents shall determine in their sole discretion subject to the foregoing provisions of this section 8. the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, or other receipt from, any of the collateral shall be delivered to the collateral agent and applied by the collateral agent in accordance with the instructions regarding such allocation of funds provided by the calculation agents, in the following order of priorities: first , to the payment to the agents of the expenses of such sale or other realization, including reasonable compensation to the agents and their agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances incurred or made by the agents in connection therewith, including brokerage fees in connection with the sale by the agents of any collateral; second , to the payment to each bank of its pro rata share of the aggregate amount owing by pledgor in respect of the transactions; and finally , if all of the obligations of pledgor hereunder and under the other transaction documents have been fully discharged or sufficient funds have been set aside by the collateral agent at the request of pledgor for the discharge thereof, any remaining proceeds shall be released to pledgor. (e) to the extent necessary to perform its duties under section 8(d) above, the collateral agent may require the calculation agents to provide to the collateral agent instructions regarding the allocation of proceeds from the realization of collateral. (f) pledgor recognizes that the secured parties may not choose to effect a public sale of all or a part of the collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained (x) in the securities act of 1933, as amended, as now or hereafter in effect, (y) in applicable blue sky or other state securities laws or (z) in any applicable rules or regulations, as now or hereafter in effect, and may resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. pledgor agrees that private sales so made may be at prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such collateral were sold at public sales, and that the secured 22 parties have no obligation to delay sale of any such collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such collateral, even if such issuer would agree, to register such collateral for public sale under such applicable securities laws. pledgor agrees that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances, including, without limitation, any sale to parent or parent&#146;s designee pursuant to the liquidity agreement, shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. (g) upon the occurrence of an acceleration event, pledgor shall not vote nor give consents, ratifications and waivers with respect to the collateral without the prior written consent of the collateral agent. pledgor covenants and agrees that pledgor will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as the agents reasonably deem necessary or advisable in order to communicate such restriction to the issuer or its agents. (h) the collateral agent and the other secured parties agree and acknowledge that any disposition of all or any part of the collateral pursuant to the exercise of remedies under this section 8 or otherwise shall be subject to the terms of the new jersey ica trust agreement, the new jersey ica securities account control agreement and the collateral disposition and forbearance agreement referenced in section 17 hereof so long as such agreements are in effect. section 9 . prepayments and payments.

(b) each bank making a prepayment shall wire the amount thereof in immediately available funds, by 12:00 noon (new york city time), on the proposed prepayment date, to the payment account. the collateral agent shall make such funds available to pledgor by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of pledgor in new york city designated by pledgor in the applicable prepayment notice. (c) pledgor shall make each payment required to be made by it under the transaction documents to the payment account. the collateral agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of any other persons to 23 the appropriate parties promptly after receipt thereof ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of the payments then due to such parties. (d) at least five business days prior to the date on which a payment is due under the confirmations, the calculation agents shall furnish to the collateral agent the amount and description of such payment. the calculation agents shall provide the collateral agent with such additional information regarding payments in respect of the transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the interest rate applicable to the floating amount under the swap transactions) as the collateral agent may reasonably request in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. section 10 . the agents. (a) each bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the collateral agent and each disposition agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this agreement as are delegated to the collateral agent and the disposition agents by the terms hereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. the collateral agent may also determine purely administrative matters without consulting the banks. (b) the obligations of the agents hereunder are only those expressly set forth in this agreement. (c) the agents may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. (d) neither any agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with this agreement (1) with the written consent or at the written request of any bank or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. the agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any event of default or termination event unless and until notice describing such event of default or termination event is given to the agents by pledgor or any initial bank. no agent shall incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by authorized officers of the proper party or parties. (e) beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the collateral agent shall have no duty as to any collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent, bailee, clearing corporation or 24 securities intermediary or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. the collateral agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the collateral if the collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any agent, bailee, clearing corporation or securities intermediary selected by the collateral agent in good faith (or selected by an agent, bailee, clearing corporation or securities intermediary so selected by the collateral agent or by any agent, bailee, clearing corporation or securities intermediary selected in accordance with this parenthetical phrase). (f) each agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other security document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such agent. each agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective related parties. the exculpatory provisions of this article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the related parties of the agents and any such sub-agent. (g) any corporation or association into which collateral agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer its agency business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which it is a party, shall, subject to the prior written consent of the initial banks, be and become a successor collateral agent hereunder and vested with all of the title to the collateral and all of the powers, discretions, immunities, privileges and other matters as was its predecessor without, except as provided above, the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act, deed or conveyance on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
