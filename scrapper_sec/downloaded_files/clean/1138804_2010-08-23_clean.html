&#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; (b)&#160;&#160; exchange procedure. &#160;&#160;as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the surviving corporation or parent shall cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (i)&#160;a form of letter of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying substitute irs form w-9 or the applicable irs form w-8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates to the paying agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an &#8220;agent&#8217;s message&#8221; with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as parent may reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the company) and (ii)&#160;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the merger consideration.&#160;&#160;upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the paying agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the paying agent, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the merger consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to section&#160;2.01(c), and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.&#160;&#160;in the event of a transfer of ownership of company common stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the company, payment of the merger consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate so surrendered is registered if such certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the surviving corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.&#160;&#160;no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any certificate. &#160; (c)&#160;&#160; no further ownership rights in company common stock. &#160;&#160;all merger consideration paid upon the surrender of a certificate in accordance with the terms of this article&#160;ii shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of company common stock formerly represented by such certificate.&#160;&#160;at the close of business on the day on which the effective time occurs, the stock transfer books of the company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.&#160;&#160;if, after the close of business on the day on which the effective time occurs, certif icates are presented to the surviving corporation or the paying agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this article&#160;ii. &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; (d)&#160;&#160; no liability. &#160;&#160;none of parent, sub, the company, the surviving corporation or the paying agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any merger consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.&#160;&#160;if any certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any merger consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, any merger consideration payable in accordance with this article ii in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear o f all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. &#160; (e)&#160;&#160; lost certificates. &#160;&#160;if any certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the surviving corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the paying agent or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the merger consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed certificate. &#160; (f)&#160;&#160; withholding rights. &#160;&#160;parent, the surviving corporation or the paying agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement to any holder of shares of company common stock such amounts as parent, the surviving corporation or the paying agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220; code &#8221;), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.&#160;&#160;to the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by parent, the surviving corporation or the paying agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of company common stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by parent, the surviving corporation or the paying agent. &#160; (g)&#160;&#160; termination of fund. &#160;&#160;at any time following the six-month anniversary of the closing date, the surviving corporation shall be entitled to require the paying agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the paying agent pursuant to section&#160;2.03(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates, and thereafter, subject to time limitations in section&#160;2.03(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to parent and the surviving corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any merger consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any certificates held by such ho lders, as determined pursuant to this agreement, without any interest thereon. &#160;
