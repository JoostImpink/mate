stephen r. volk executive officer united states vice chairman citigroup inc. 399 park avenue new york, ny 10043 54 schedule ii on december 3, 2002, salomon smith barney inc. (&#147;salomon smith barney&#148;), now named citigroup global markets inc. (&#147;cgmi&#148;), a subsidiary of citigroup inc. (&#147;citigroup&#148;), was one of eight respondents to settle sec, nyse, and nasd charges of violations of the record-keeping requirements of section 17(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (&#147;exchange act&#148;) and rule 17a-4 thereunder during the period from 1999 to at least 2001. the sec order found that, during all or part of the relevant period, each respondent failed to preserve for three years, and/or to preserve in an accessible place for two years, electronic mail communications (including inter-office memoranda and communications) received and sent by its agents and employees that related to its business as a member of an exchange, broker or dealer. the sec order also found that each of the respondents lacked adequate systems or procedures for the preservation of electronic mail communications. the sec order required the respondents to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of section 17(a) of the exchange act and rule 17a-4 promulgated thereunder. respondents were censured pursuant to section 15(b)(4) of the exchange act. each respondent was also required to pay the amount of $1,650,000, divided equally between the sec, nasd, and nyse. on april 28, 2003, salomon smith barney announced final agreements with the sec, the nasd, the nyse and the new york attorney general (as lead state among the 50 states, the district of columbia and puerto rico) to resolve on a civil basis all their outstanding investigations into its research and initial public offering allocation and distribution practices. salomon smith barney paid $300 million for retrospective relief, plus $25 million for investor education, and committed to spend $75 million to provide independent third-party research to its clients at no charge. salomon smith barney adopted new policies and procedures to further ensure the independence of its research and addressed other issues identified in the course of the investigation. salomon smith barney reached these final settlement agreements without admitting or denying any wrongdoing or liability. the settlements did not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceeding. on july 28, 2003, citigroup settled enforcement proceedings related to the manipulation of enron's and dynegy&#146;s financial statements. the commission found that citigroup knew or should have known that the acts or omissions described in the order would contribute to enron's and dynegy&#146;s violations of exchange act section 10(b) and exchange act rule 10b-5. consequently, citigroup was found to be a cause of enron's and dynegy&#146;s violations within the meaning of exchange act section 21c. citigroup consented to an order to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and agreed to pay $120 million as disgorgement, interest and penalty. on march 23, 2005, the sec entered an administrative and cease-and-desist order against cgmi. the sec order found that cgmi willfully violated section 17(a)(2) of the securities act and rule 10b-10 promulgated under the exchange act. specifically, the order found that there were two distinct disclosure failures by cgmi in the offer and sale of mutual fund shares to its customers. based on these findings, the order censured cgmi, required that cgmi cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of section 17(a) of the securities act and exchange act rule 10b-10, and required that cgmi pay a $20 million civil money penalty. in a related proceeding on march 22, 2005, the nasd accepted a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent dated march 18, 2005 (the &#147;awc&#148;) that had been submitted by cgmi. without admitting or denying the findings, cgmi accepted and consented, prior to a hearing and without an adjudication of any issue of law or fact, to the entry of findings by nasd. based on its findings and with cgmi&#146;s consent, the nasd censured cgmi and fined it $6.25 million. in the awc, cgmi also agreed to complete certain undertakings, including retaining an independent consultant, among other things, to conduct a comprehensive review of the completeness of its disclosures regarding the differences in mutual fund share classes and the policies and procedures relating to cgmi&#146;s recommendations to its customers of different class shares of mutual funds. on may 31, 2005, the sec issued an order in connection with the settlement of an administrative proceeding against smith barney fund management llc (&#147;sbfm&#148;), a former subsidiary of citigroup, and cgmi, relating to the appointment of an affiliated transfer agent for the smith barney family of mutual funds managed by sbfm (the &#147;affected funds&#148;). the sec order finds that sbfm and cgmi willfully violated section 206(1) of the investment advisers act of 1940, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder (the &#147;advisers act&#148;). specifically, the order found that sbfm and cgmi knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose to the boards of the affected funds in 1999 when proposing a new transfer agent arrangement with an affiliated transfer agent that: first data investors services group (&#147;first data&#148;), the affected funds&#146; then-existing transfer agent, had offered to continue as transfer agent and do the same work for substantially less money than before; and that citigroup asset management (&#147;cam&#148;), the former citigroup business unit that, at the time, included the affected funds&#146; investment manager and other investment advisory companies, had entered into a side letter with first data under which cam agreed to recommend the appointment of first data as sub-transfer agent to the affiliated transfer agent in exchange for, among other things, a guarantee by first data of specified amounts of asset management and investment banking fees to cam and cgmi. the order also found that sbfm and cgmi willfully violated section 206(2) of the advisers act by virtue of the omissions discussed above and other misrepresentations and omissions in the materials provided to the affected funds&#146; boards, including the failure to make clear that the affiliated transfer agent would earn a high profit for performing limited functions while first data continued to perform almost all of the transfer agent functions, and the suggestion that the proposed arrangement was in the affected funds&#146; best interests and that no viable alternatives existed. sbfm and cgmi do not admit or deny any wrongdoing or liability. the settlement does not establish wrongdoing or liability for purposes of any other proceeding. 55 the sec censured sbfm and cgmi and ordered them to cease and desist from violations of sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the advisers act. the order required citigroup to pay $208.1 million, including $109 million in disgorgement of profits, $19.1 million in interest, and a civil money penalty of $80 million. approximately $24.4 million has already been paid to the affected funds, primarily through fee waivers. the remaining $183.7 million, including the penalty, has been paid to the u.s. treasury and will be distributed pursuant to a plan submitted for the approval of the sec. at this time, there is no certainty as to how the above-described proceeds of the settlement will be distributed, to whom such distributions will be made, the methodology by which such distributions will be allocated, and when such distributions will be made. the order also required that transfer agency fees received from the affected funds since december 1, 2004, less certain expenses, be placed in escrow and provided that a portion of such fees may be subsequently distributed in accordance with the terms of the order. on april 3, 2006, an aggregate amount of approximately $9 million held in escrow was distributed to the affected funds. the order required sbfm to recommend a new transfer agent contract to the affected fund&#146;s boards within 180 days of the entry of the order; if a citigroup affiliate submitted a proposal to serve as transfer agent or sub-transfer agent, sbfm and cgmi would have been required, at their expense, to engage an independent monitor to oversee a competitive bidding process. on november 21, 2005, and within the specified timeframe, the affected funds&#146; boards selected a new transfer agent for the affected fund. no citigroup affiliate submitted a proposal to serve as transfer agent. under the order, sbfm also must comply with an amended version of a vendor policy that citigroup instituted in august 2004. other than as described above, during the last five years, none of the reporting persons or, to the best of the knowledge of the reporting persons, any of the persons listed on schedule i attached hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or finding any violation with respect to such laws. 56 ex-7.01 2 a07-8759_2ex7d01.htm agreement of joint filing exhibit 7.01 agreement of joint filing laureate education, inc. in accordance with rule
