(2) the 1,169,165 shares listed under the heading "shared voting power," are subject to voting agreements entered into by comverse technology, inc. and certain stockholders of the issuer. see item 4 of this schedule 13d. (3) pursuant to rule 13d-3 under the exchange act, 1,020,000 shares deemed to be beneficially owned by the reporting person as a result of the stock option are also deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing this percentage. see item 5 of this schedule 13d. 2 item 1. security and issuer this statement on schedule 13d relates to shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "common stock") of loronix information systems, inc., a nevada corporation (the "company"). the principal executive offices of the company are located at 820 airport road, durango, colorado 81301. item 2. identity and background (a) - (c) this schedule 13d is being filed by comverse technology, inc., a new york corporation ("comverse"). comverse is engaged in the business of developing and supplying among other things, software and systems enabling enhanced services for wireless and wireline network operators and a digital recording systems for call centers. the principal executive officers of comverse are located at 170 crossways park drive, woodbury, new york 11797. the names, business address, citizenship and present principal occupation or employment of the senior executive officers and directors of comverse are set forth in annex a hereto. (d) - (e) during the last five years, to the best of comverse's knowledge, neither comverse nor any of its executive officers or directors listed in annex a hereto has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar misdemeanors), or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration in connection with, and as an inducement to comverse's willingness to enter into the merger agreement (as defined in item 4 below), the company has granted to comverse an option to purchase shares of common stock from the company (the "option") pursuant to a stock option agreement dated as of march 5, 2000, by and between the company and comverse (the "stock option agreement"), a copy of which is filed as exhibit 1 hereto. comverse did not pay any monetary consideration to the company for the option. the option entitles comverse to purchase up to 1,020,000 shares of the common stock (the "option shares") (or such other number of shares of common stock as equals 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock as the time of the exercise of the option) at a price of $43.79 per share (the "exercise price") payable at comverse's option, either in cash or shares of comverse common stock (as defined below). should the option become exercisable and should comverse decide to exercise the option, comverse anticipates that it would obtain funds necessary for the purchase from available working capital. 3 the foregoing summary of the stock option agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the stock option agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 1 to this schedule 13d and incorporated by reference herein. the additional 22,500 shares of common stock owned by comverse were previously purchased by comverse in the open market using available working capital. item 4. purpose of transaction on march 5, 2000, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, comverse entered into voting agreements (each, a "voting agreement") with peter jankowski, david ledwell, jonathan lupia, f. james price, timothy whitehead, donald stevens, rodney wilger and the jankowski family trust (collectively, the "loronix stockholders"). as a condition to entering into the merger agreement, comverse required that each of the loronix stockholders enter into a voting agreement with comverse, strictly in his capacity as a beneficial owner of common stock and not in his capacity as a director or officer of the company. pursuant to such voting agreement, each loronix stockholder has agreed to vote or cause to be voted all shares of common stock held of record or beneficially owned by him (whether currently owned or thereafter acquired) in favor of the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement and not to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his shares of common stock. the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of the loronix stockholders is set forth on annex b to this schedule 13d. the foregoing summary of the voting agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to all the terms and provisions of the voting agreement, a form of which is attached hereto as exhibit 2. the option granted by the company and the voting agreements entered into by the loronix stockholders were conditions of and in consideration for comverse's entering into the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of march 5, 2000 (the "merger agreement"), among the company, comverse and comverse acquisition corp., a nevada corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of comverse ("merger sub"). a copy of the merger agreement is filed as exhibit 3 hereto. capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the merger agreement. simultaneously with the execution of the stock option agreement and voting agreements, the company, comverse and merger sub entered in the merger agreement, pursuant to which merger sub would merge with and into the company (the "merger"). under the terms of the merger agreement each outstanding share of common stock will be converted into .1925 shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of comverse ("comverse common stock"). consequently the company will be the surviving corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of comverse. except as set forth herein, comverse presently does not have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. 4 the merger agreement is included as exhibit 3 and is specifically incorporated by reference herein. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a), (b) as a result of the issuance of the option, comverse may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,042,500 shares of the common stock, which would represent approximately 17.0% of the shares of the common stock outstanding after the exercise of the option (based on the number of shares of the common stock outstanding as of march 3, 2000, as set forth in the merger agreement, and treating as outstanding for this purpose the shares of common stock, subject to the option). the option shares described herein are subject to the option, which may only be exercised upon the happening of specific events, none of which has occurred as of the date hereof. nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be an admission by comverse as to the beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock (other than the 22,500 shares of common stock of the company owned by comverse), and, prior to that occurrence of any such events, comverse disclaims beneficial ownership of all of the option shares. pursuant to the voting agreements, comverse has shared power to vote an aggregate of 1,169,165 shares of common stock for the limited purposes described in item 4 above. such common stock represents approximately 23% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of march 3, 2000. comverse is not entitled to any rights as a stockholder of the shares of common stock that are subject to the voting agreements and disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock which are covered under the voting agreements. comverse would have the sole power to vote or direct the vote of and sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of, all of the shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of the option and all the share and an additional 22,500 shares of common stock of the company owned by comverse. (c) except as set forth on annex c, neither comverse nor, to the best of comverse's knowledge, any other person referred to in annex a attached hereto, beneficially owns any shares of common stock of the company. annex c sets forth transactions in the common stock by comverse during the past 60 days. (d) not applicable. (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the company consist of the stock option agreement, the merger agreement, and the voting agreements. the aforementioned documents are attached hereto as exhibits 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and are specifically incorporated herein by reference. see also description of the aforementioned documents in items 3 and 4 above. except for the merger agreement, the stock option agreement and the voting agreements, neither comverse nor, to the best of its knowledge, 5 any other person named in item 2 has any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the company including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding or proxies. item 7. materials to be filed as exhibits exhibit 1: stock option agreement dated as of march 5, 2000, by and between the company and comverse. exhibit 2: form of voting agreement with the loronix stockholders. exhibit 3: agreement and plan of merger, dated as of march 5, 2000, among the company, comverse and comverse acquisition corp. 6 signature after reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge and belief, the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct. dated: march 13, 2000 comverse technology, inc. by: /s/ william sorin ------------------------------ name: william sorin title: 7 annex a ------- name, business address, present principal occupation and citizenship of each executive officer and director of comverse technology, inc. i. executive officers of comverse kobi alexander 170 crossways park drive president, chairman and chief israeli citizen woodbury, new york 11791 executive officer david kreinberg 170 crossways park drive chief financial officer us citizen woodbury, new york 11791 ii. directors of comverse kobi alexander 170 crossways park drive president, chairman and chief israeli citizen woodbury, new york 11791 executive officer william f. sorin 170 crossways park drive secretary and general counsel us citizen woodbury, new york 11791 zvi alexander 4 raynham chairman of at&t exploration company israeli citizen norfolk crescent ltd. london w2 2pg england john h. friedman 641 lexington avenue managing director easton capital corp. us citizen 21st floor new york, ny 10022 itsik danziger 23 habarazel street president & chief operating officer israeli citizen tel aviv, israel of comverse network system francis e. girard 100 quannapowitt parkway chief executive officer of comverse us citizen wakefield, ma 01880 network systems sam oolie c/o no fire technologies president of oolie enterprises us citizen 21 industrial avenue upper saddle river, nj 07458 shaula alexander yemini 14 mamaroneck avenue president and chief executive officer us citizen 3rd floor of system management arts incorporated white plains, ny 10601 annex b ------- number of shares of loronix stockholders common stock beneficially owned -------------------- ------------------------------- peter jankowski 253,616 david ledwell 2,000 jonathan lupia 17,000 f. james price 24,7000 timothy whitehead 28,164 donald stevens 22,8000 rodney wilger 82,070 jankowski family trust 738,815 annex c ------- transactions in common stock of loronix by comverse comverse made the following purchases of the common stock in the last 60 days: number of shares date of purchase purchased price per share ---------------- ---------------- --------------- february 14, 2000 5,000 $24.125 february 14, 2000 5,000 $24.25 february 14, 2000 2,500 $24.06 february 14, 2000 5,000 $24.12 february 16, 2000 5,000 $23.62 exhibit index ------------- number description - ------ ----------- exhibit 1 stock option agreement dated as of march 5, 2000, by and between the company and comverse. exhibit 2 form of voting agreement with the loronix stockholders. exhibit 3 agreement and plan of merger, dated as of march 5, 2000, among the company, comverse and comverse acquisition corp. ex-99 2 exhibit 1 exhibit 1 --------- stock option agreement ---------------------- stock option agreement, dated march 5, 2000, by and between loronix information systems, inc., a nevada corporation (the "company"), and comverse technology, inc., a new york corporation ("parent"). whereas, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this agreement, the company, parent and comverse acquisition corp., a nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of parent ("sub"), are entering into an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "merger agreement"; capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the merger agreement), which provides that, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, sub will be merged with the company; and whereas, as a condition to parent's and sub's willingness to enter into the merger agreement, parent has requested that the company agree, and in order to induce parent to enter into the merger agreement, the company has so agreed, to grant to parent an option with respect to certain shares of the company's common stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the merger agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. grant of option. the company hereby grants parent an irrevocable option (the "stock option") to purchase up to 1,020,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the company (the "company common stock"), or such other number of shares of company common stock as equals 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of company common stock at the time of exercise of the stock option, in the manner set forth below, at a price of $43.79 per share (the "exercise price"), payable, at parent's option, either (a) in cash or (b) in shares of parent common stock, in each case, in accordance with section 4 hereof. 2. exercise of option. (a) the stock option may be exercised by parent, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time after the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to section 8.3(a) or 8.4(a) ( a "trigger event"). in the event parent wishes to exercise the stock option, parent shall deliver to the company a written notice (an "exercise notice") specifying the total number of shares of company common stock it wishes to purchase. each closing of a purchase of shares of company common stock (a "closing") shall occur at a place, on a date and at a time designated by parent in an exercise notice delivered at least two business days prior to the date of the closing. (b) the stock option shall terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the effective time; (ii) the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 ny2:\888369\01 thereof, other than a termination as a result of the occurrence of a trigger event; or (ii) 180 days following any termination of the merger agreement as the result of the occurrence of a trigger event (or if, at the expiration of such 180 day period the stock option cannot be exercised by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, or because the applicable waiting period under the hsr act has not expired or been terminated, 10 business days after such impediment to exercise shall have been removed or shall have become final and not subject to appeal, but in no event under this clause (ii) later than 270 days after the date of termination of the merger agreement). (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, the stock option may not be exercised if parent is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this agreement or in the merger agreement. 3. conditions to closing. the obligation of the company to issue shares of company common stock to parent hereunder is subject to the conditions (which, other than the conditions described in clauses (i) and (ii) below, may be waived by the company in its sole discretion) that (i) all waiting periods, if any, under the hsr act applicable to the issuance of shares of company common stock hereunder shall have expired or have been terminated, and all consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, any federal administrative agency or commission or other federal governmental authority or instrumentality, if any, required in connection with the issuance of shares of company common stock hereunder shall have been obtained or made, as the case may be; (ii) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise restraining such issuance shall be in effect; and (iii) such shares shall have been approved for listing on the nasdaq national market ("nasdaq") upon official notice of issuance. 4. closing. at any closing, (a) the company will deliver to parent a single certificate in definitive form representing the number of shares of the company common stock designated by parent in its exercise notice, such certificate to be registered in the name of parent, sub or such other affiliate of parent as parent shall designate in the exercise notice and shall bear the legend set forth in section 11, and (b) parent will deliver to the company the aggregate exercise price for the shares of the company common stock so designated and being purchased at such closing by (x) wire transfer of immediately available funds, (y) a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of parent common stock issuable in consideration thereof or (z) any combination of such funds and parent common stock. for the purposes of this agreement, the number of shares of parent common stock to be delivered to the company shall be equal to the number of shares of the company common stock with respect to which the stock option is being exercised multiplied by an amount equal to (i) $43.79 divided by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of shares of parent common stock on the nasdaq national market for the five trading days immediately preceding the date the exercise notice is delivered to the company. 5. representations and warranties of the company. the company represents and warrants to parent that (a) the company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware and has the 2 corporate power and authority to enter into this agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder;

firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the parent and the underwriters shall effect as wide a distribution of such registrable securities as is reasonably practicable and shall use their best efforts to prevent any person (including any group) and its affiliates from purchasing through such offering restricted shares representing more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the registrant on a fully diluted basis (a "permitted offering"). the registration notice shall include a certificate executed by the parent and its proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing reasonably acceptable to the registrant (the "manager"), stating that (i) they have a good faith intention to commence promptly a permitted offering and (ii) the manager in good faith believes that, based on the then prevailing market conditions, it will be able to sell the registrable securities at a per share price to be specified in such registration notice (the "fair market value"). the registrant (and/or any person designated by the registrant) shall thereupon have the option exercisable by written notice delivered to parent within 10 business days after the receipt of the registration notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase all or any part of the registrable securities for cash at a price (the "option price") equal to the product of (i) the number of registrable securities and (ii) the fair market value of such registrable securities. any such purchase of registrable securities by the registrant hereunder shall take place at a closing to be held at the principal executive offices of the registrant or its counsel at any reasonable date and time designated by the registrant and its designee in such notice within 20 business days after delivery of such notice. any payment for the shares to be purchased shall be made by delivery at the time of such closing of the option price in immediately available funds. if the registrant does not elect to exercise its option pursuant to this section 8 with respect to all registrable securities designated in the registration notice, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the registration under the securities act of the unpurchased registrable securities; provided, however, 5 that (i) parent shall not be entitled to more than an aggregate of three effective registration statements hereunder and (ii) the registrant will not be required to file any such registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 90 days after such request in the case of clause (b) below or 120 days in the case of clause (a) and 150 days in the case of clause (c) below) when (a) the registrant is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, in the judgment of the board of directors of the registrant, such information would have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time; (b) the registrant is required under the securities act to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (c) the registrant determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving the registrant or any of its affiliates. if consummation of the sale of any registrable securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within 120 days after the filing with the sec of the initial registration statement with respect thereto, the provisions of this section 8 shall again be applicable to any proposed registration; provided, however, that parent shall not be entitled to request more than two registrations pursuant to this section 8 in any 18 month period. the registrant shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all registrable securities registered pursuant to this section 8 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as parent may reasonably request and shall continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however, that the registrant shall not be required to qualify to do business, subject itself to general taxation or consent to general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision. the registration rights set forth in this section 8 are subject to the condition that parent shall provide the registrant with such information with respect to parent's registrable securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and such other information with respect to parent as, in the reasonable judgment of counsel for the registrant, is necessary to enable the registrant to include in such registration statement all material facts required by applicable law to be disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder. a registration effected under this section 8 shall be effected at the registrant's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and the expenses of counsel to parent, and the registrant shall provide to the underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and accountants' "comfort" letters from auditors) as are customary in connection with underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. in connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each other and the underwriters in the customary manner and (ii) to enter into an underwriting agreement in form and substance customary to transactions of this type with the manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering. 6 the registration rights set forth in this section 8 terminate upon the registration of registrable securities becoming saleable pursuant to rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended. 9. profit limitation. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in no event shall parent's total profit (as hereinafter defined) exceed $11 million and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount parent, at its sole election, shall either (a) deliver to the company for cancellation shares of company common stock previously purchased by parent, (b) pay cash or other consideration to the company or (c) undertake any combination thereof, so that parent's total profit shall not exceed $11 million after taking into account the foregoing actions. as used herein, the term "total profit" shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by parent pursuant to the company's repurchase of the stock option pursuant to section 7 hereof, (ii)(a) the net cash amounts received by parent pursuant to the sale of restricted shares (or any other securities into which such shares are converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (b) parent's purchase price for such shares, and (iii) the aggregate amount received by parent from the company pursuant to sections 8.5(b) of the merger agreement. 10. adjustment upon changes in capitalization. in the event of any change in company common stock by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, mergers (other than the merger), recapitalizations, combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or securities subject to the stock option, and the exercise price per share, shall be adjusted appropriately. 11. restrictive legends. each certificate representing shares of company common stock issued to parent hereunder (and any shares of parent common stock delivered to the company at a closing) shall initially be endorsed with a legend in substantially the following form: the securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, and may be reoffered or sold only if so registered or if an exemption from such registration and applicable state securities laws is available. such securities are also subject to additional restrictions on transfer as set forth in the stock option agreement, dated march 5, 2000, a copy of which may be obtained from the issuer hereof. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 8 shall not be required to bear such legend. 12. binding effect; no assignment. this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, and permitted assigns. except as expressly provided in this agreement, neither this 7 agreement nor the rights or the obligations of either party hereto are assignable, except by operation of law, or with the written consent of the other party, except that parent may assign its rights hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of parent. nothing contained in this agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted assigns any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever by reason of this agreement. any restricted shares sold by a party in compliance with the provisions of section 8 shall, upon consummation of such sale, be free of the restrictions imposed with respect to such shares by this agreement, unless and until such party shall repurchase or otherwise become the beneficial owner of such shares, and any transferee of such shares shall not be entitled to the rights of such party. certificates representing shares sold in a registered public offering pursuant to section 8 shall not be required to bear the legend set forth in section 11. 13. specific performance. the parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this agreement. in the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. 14. entire agreement. this agreement and the merger agreement (together with the other documents and instruments referred to in the merger agreement, and the exhibits and disclosure schedules thereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof. 15. further assurances. each party will execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 16. no remedy in certain circumstances. each party agrees that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this agreement or makes the agreement impossible to perform in which case this agreement shall terminate. except as otherwise contemplated by this agreement, to the extent that a party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other competent authority, such party shall incur no liability or obligation unless such 8 party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment. 17.
