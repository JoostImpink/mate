the class of securities to which this statement relates is the common stock, par value $.01 per share ("drilex common stock"), of drilex international inc., a delaware corporation ("drilex"). the address of the principal executive offices of drilex is 15151 sommermeyer, houston, texas 77041. item 2. identity and background this statement on schedule 13d is filed by baker hughes incorporated, a delaware corporation ("baker hughes"). baker hughes is a provider of products and services to the oil, gas and process industries. information with respect to the executive officers and directors of baker hughes, including name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and the organization in which such employment is conducted, and their citizenship is listed on the schedule attached hereto as schedule i, which is incorporated in this schedule 13d by reference. the address of the principal business and office of baker hughes is 3900 essex lane, houston, texas 77027. other than baker hughes' executive officers and directors, there is no corporation or other person ultimately controlling baker hughes. during the last five years, neither baker hughes nor, to the best of baker hughes' knowledge, any executive officer or director of baker hughes has been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration no funds were used in connection with entering into the stockholder agreement (as defined in item 4 of this schedule 13d). baker hughes expects to use working capital to pay the purchase price of any shares of drilex common stock that may be purchased pursuant to the stockholder agreement described in item 4. item 4. purpose of transaction (a)-(c) on april 16, 1997, drilex, baker hughes and baker hughes merger, inc., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of baker hughes ("subsidiary"), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") pursuant to which subsidiary would be merged (the "merger") with and into drilex and each outstanding share of drilex common stock would be converted into a right to receive shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of baker hughes ("baker hughes common stock"), pursuant to a formula described therein. the consummation of the merger is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including approval of the stockholders of drilex and expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended. following the merger, drilex would be a wholly owned subsidiary of baker hughes. page 3 of 11 pages 4 also on april 16, 1997, and in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, baker hughes entered into a stockholder agreement (the "stockholder agreement") with drlx partners, l.p., a delaware limited partnership ("drlx partners"). drlx partners owns 4,119,207 shares (approximately 61.8%) of drilex common stock. drlx partners entered into the stockholder agreement with baker hughes as an inducement to baker hughes to enter into the merger agreement. the stockholder agreement provides for drlx partners' grant to baker hughes of an irrevocable option (the "option") for the purchase, subject to certain conditions, of up to 1,665,839 shares (the "option shares") of drilex common stock held by drlx partners at a per share cash exercise price of $16.00. the stockholder agreement provides that the option may be exercised in whole at any time, and in part from time to time, after the occurrence of a triggering event (as defined in the stockholder agreement), but prior to the termination date (as defined in the stockholder agreement). generally, a "triggering event" means the termination of the merger agreement in the context of a third party's making a competing acquisition proposal (as defined for purposes of the stockholder agreement) or the occurrence of any event giving baker hughes the right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to section 7.1(e) of the merger agreement (generally, the withdrawal or modification of the recommendation of drilex's board of directors with respect to the merger). for purposes of the stockholder agreement, the "termination date" means the first to occur of (1) the effectiveness of the merger (the "effective time") and (2) the close of business on the date 45 days after the termination of the merger agreement, provided that such date shall be extended under certain circumstances. the stockholder agreement also provides that, with respect to any vote of the stockholders of drilex held prior to the earlier of (1) the effective time and (2) the termination of the merger agreement (such earlier time being referred to as the "voting termination date"), drlx partners shall vote or cause to be voted the 4,119,207 shares of drilex common stock held by it (which includes the option shares), together with any shares of capital stock of drilex acquired by drlx partners after the date of the stockholder agreement (collectively, the "stockholder shares"), in favor of the approval of the merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and any actions required in furtherance of the merger agreement or the stockholder agreement. the stockholder agreement also provides that drlx partners will not enter into any agreement or understanding with any person prior to the voting termination date, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant any proxy or give instructions with respect to the voting of the stockholder shares in any manner inconsistent with the foregoing. prior to the termination date, the stockholder agreement prohibits drlx partners from, among other things, subjecting any of the option shares to, or suffering to exist on any of the option shares, any lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other incumbrance or restriction, subject to certain limitations. pursuant to the stockholder agreement, drlx partners also agreed not to sell, transfer, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of (a) any of the option shares prior to the termination date or (b) any of the stockholder shares prior to the record date for the stockholder meeting of drilex to vote on the merger agreement. page 4 of 11 pages 5 except as contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholder agreement, baker hughes has no current intention of acquiring or disposing of shares of drilex common stock; however, baker hughes' intentions may change in light of the facts and circumstances that may arise in future dealings in the marketplace or other events effecting drilex or baker hughes and the operation of the terms of these agreements. (d) as part of the merger agreement, the directors of subsidiary at the effective time will become the directors of drilex. the officers of drilex at the effective time will serve as the initial officers of drilex following the merger. (e) the merger agreement provides that, at or prior to the closing of the merger agreement, baker hughes shall refinance (or arrange for the continuation of) or repay all drilex's debt under its current bank credit facility. pursuant to the merger, all shares of drilex common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall be converted into baker hughes common stock. all such shares of drilex common stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. each issued and outstanding share of the common stock of subsidiary shall be converted into and become 10,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of drilex common stock. subsidiary has 1,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. (f) upon the effective time, as a result of the merger, drilex would become a wholly owned subsidiary of baker hughes. (g) the merger agreement provides for limitations on the solicitation by drilex, its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives of any proposal or offer (other than by baker hughes) with respect to certain types of business combinations and transactions. the stockholder agreement has similar limitations on drlx partners and its officers, directors, employees, partners, agents, affiliates or other representatives. the merger agreement also provides for a $4 million termination fee payable to baker hughes by drilex if the merger agreement is terminated for certain reasons. (h)-(j) as a result of the merger, drilex common stock will no longer be traded on the nasdaq national market. *** the foregoing responses to this item 4 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, the full text of which is filed as exhibit 1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and the stockholder agreement, the full text of which is filed as exhibit 2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. page 5 of 11 pages 6 item 5. interest in securities of the issuer (a) drilex represented in the merger agreement that it had outstanding as of april 1, 1997 an aggregate of 6,663,356 shares of drilex common stock. the number of outstanding shares of drilex common stock as to which baker hughes has a right to acquire pursuant to the option (and thus may be deemed to beneficially own) is 1,665,839 (or 25.0% of the shares of drilex common stock issued and outstanding). to the best of the baker hughes' knowledge and belief none of the executive officers or the directors of baker hughes beneficially own any shares of the drilex common stock.

(d) baker hughes shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of baker hughes common stock for delivery upon exercise of the drilex stock options assumed in accordance with this section 5.10. as soon as practicable after the effective time, baker hughes shall file with the sec a registration statement on form s-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of baker hughes common stock subject to the drilex stock options and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as drilex stock options remain outstanding. 5.11 indemnification; directors' and officers' insurance.
