an agreement and plan of merger dated as of the date hereof (as in effect from time to time, the "merger agreement"). each capitalized term which is used but not otherwise defined in this agreement has the meaning assigned to that term in the merger agreement. if the merger agreement is terminated by the company pursuant to any escrow-surrender provision (as defined below), then the company will be entitled to a payment in the amount of the escrow payment (as defined below). as security for the obligations to make such payment, acquiror is depositing or causing to be deposited a letter of credit (as defined below) in accordance with the terms of this agreement, to be held and acted upon by escrow agent in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the parties agree as follows: 1 definitions. as used in this agreement: (a) "escrow-surrender event" means solely the termination of the merger agreement under the circumstances defined in sections 8.2(b)(i), 8.2(b)(ii), 8.2(b)(iii), 8.2(b)(iv) or 8.2(b)(v) of the merger agreement.

(b) the company or acquiror may examine the escrow agent's records pertaining to this agreement at any time during normal business hours at escrow agent's office upon 24 hours' prior notice. (c) this agreement is a personal one, escrow agent's duties hereunder being only to the other parties hereto, their successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives, and to no other person. (d) no succession to, or assignment of, the interest of acquiror or the company will be binding upon the escrow agent unless and until written evidence of such succession or assignment, in form satisfactory to escrow agent, has been filed with and accepted by escrow agent. 4 5 (e) escrow agent may rely or act upon requests or instructions signed by the proper parties or bearing a signature or signatures reasonably believed by escrow agent to be genuine of the proper parties. (f) in case any emergency held by escrow agent will be attached, garnished or levied upon under a court order, or the delivery thereof will be stayed or enjoined by a court order, or any writ, order, judgment or decree will be made or entered by any court, or any order, judgment or decree will be made or entered by any court affecting the property deposited under this agreement or any party thereof, escrow agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered or issued, whether or with or without jurisdiction, and in case escrow agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order, judgment or decree, escrow agent will not be liable to acquiror or the company or to any other person by reason of such compliance in connection with such litigation, and the company and acquiror jointly and severally agree to pay to escrow agent on demand its reasonable costs, attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in connection with such litigation (g) subject to the terms of this paragraph 6(g), escrow agent reserves the right to resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to acquiror and the company specifying the effective date thereof. within 30 days after receiving such notice, acquiror and the company jointly will appoint a successor escrow agent to which escrow agent may distribute the property then held hereunder, less escrow agent's accrued fees and reasonable costs and expenses. escrow agent hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the issuing bank's conditions for transfer of the letter of credit to a successor escrow agent. if a successor escrow agent has not been appointed or has not accepted such appointment by the end of such 30-day period, escrow agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent, and acquiror and the company will pay the reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys' fees which are incurred in connection with such proceeding. notwithstanding the above, if a transfer of the letter of credit is prohibited by this terms, or if the letter of credit does not expressly permit a subsequent holder to draw on such letter of credit, then escrow agent shall not deliver the letter of credit to the clerk for any such court, but instead either (i) acquiror shall arrange for the replacement of such letter of credit with another letter of credit permitting such transfer and permitting the subsequent holder to draw on the replacement letter of credit in accordance with the terms hereof and as specified in the replacement letter of credit (which shall be on the same terms and conditions contained in the letter of credit), in which event the escrow agent may deposit such replacement letter of credit with the clerk of any such court, or 5 6 (ii) the escrow agent shall draw on such non-transferable letter of credit and deliver the proceeds to the clerk of such court.

issuance of the common stock upon such exercise would cause the company to be in violation of the telecommunications act of 1996 or the rules and regulations in effect thereunder. a holder desiring to exercise warrants shall, if requested by the company, furnish to the company such additional information as the company deems reasonably necessary in order to determine if exercise of a warrant may cause the company to be in said violation. in the event the company's counsel determines that, in such counsel's opinion after review of such information, if any, requested by and delivered to, the company, the exercise of a warrant would cause the company to be in violation of the telecommunications act of 1996 or the rules and regulations in effect thereunder, the company -4- 5 shall notify such holder to that effect. upon receipt of said notice, such holder may take such steps, at its own expense, as it reasonably determines necessary so that the exercise of the warrant would not cause such a violation; provided, that upon completion of said steps, such holder shall notify the company and the provisions of this section 5.3 shall then apply with respect to the proposed revised transaction. 5.4 legend on certificate. the certificates evidencing the warrants may, in the sole discretion of the company, bear a legend relating to certain limitations on the ownership of common stock imposed by the telecommunications act of 1996. section 6. payment of taxes. the company will pay all documentary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of warrant shares upon the exercise of warrants; provided, however, that the company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any warrants or certificates for warrant shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of warrants in respect of which such warrant shares are issued. section 7. mutilated or missing warrants. in case any of the certificates evidencing the warrants shall be mutilated, lost stolen or destroyed, the company shall issue, and the warrant agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated warrant certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the warrant certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent right or interest, but only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the company and the warrant agent of such loss, theft or destruction of such warrant and indemnity or bond, if requested, also satisfactory to them. an applicant for such a substitute warrant certificate shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the company or the warrant agent may prescribe. section 8. reservation of warrant shares; purchase, call and cancellation of warrants. 8.1 reservation of warrant shares. there have been reserved, and the company shall at all times keep reserved, out of its authorized common stock, a number of shares of common stock sufficient to provide for the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the outstanding warrants. the transfer agent for the common stock and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose. the company will keep a copy of this agreement on file with the transfer agent for the common stock and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the warrants. the warrant agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to requisition from time to time from such transfer agent the stock certificates required to honor outstanding warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this agreement. the company will supply such transfer agent with duly executed stock certificates for such purposes and will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in section 11 hereof. all warrants surrendered in the -5- 6 exercise of the rights thereby evidenced shall be

herein, to purchase or otherwise acquire warrants at such times, in such manner and for such consideration as it may deem appropriate. 8.3 cancellation of warrants. in the event the company shall purchase or otherwise acquire warrants, the same shall thereupon be delivered to the warrant agent and be canceled by it and retired. the warrant agent shall cancel any warrant surrendered for exchange, substitution, transfer or exercise in whole or in part. section 9. warrant price. the price per share at which warrant shares shall be purchasable upon exercise of warrants shall be $______ (the "warrant price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to section 10 hereof. section 10. adjustment of warrant price and number of warrant shares. the number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events, as hereinafter defined. 10.1 mechanical adjustments. the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price shall be subject to adjustment as follows: (a) in case the company shall (i) pay a dividend in shares of common stock or make a distribution in shares of common stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of common stock, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of shares of common stock, or (iv) issue by reclassification of its shares of common stock other securities of the company (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the company is surviving corporation), the number of warrant shares purchasable upon exercise of each warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of each warrant shall be entitled to receive the kind and number of warrant shares or other securities of the company which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to the record date, if any, or such event. (b) in case the company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its outstanding common stock, without any charge to such holders, entitling them (for a period within 45 days after the record date mentioned below) to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock at a price per share which is -6- 7 lower at the record date mentioned below than the then current market price per share of common stock (as defined in paragraph (d) below) the number of warrant shares thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be determined by multiplying the number of warrant shares theretofore purchasable upon exercise of each warrant by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock so offered would purchase at the then current market price per share of common stock. such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights, options or warrants are issued, and shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants. (c) in case the company shall distribute to all holders of its shares of common stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions payable out of consolidated earnings or surplus legally available for dividends and dividends or distributions referred to in paragraph (a) or rights, options or warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of common stock (excluding those referred to in paragraph (b) above), then in each case the number of warrant shares thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant shall be determined by multiplying the number of warrant shares theretofore purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant, by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the then current market price per share of common stock (as defined in paragraph (d) below) on the date of such distribution, and of which the denominator shall be the then current market price per share of common stock, less the then fair value (as determined by the board of directors of the company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights, options or warrants, or of such convertible or exchangeable securities applicable to one share of common stock. such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made, and shall become effective on the date of distribution retroactive to the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. in the company's sole discretion, in the event of a distribution by the company to all holders of its shares of common stock of the capital stock of a subsidiary or securities convertible into or exercisable for such stock, then in lieu of an adjustment in the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant, the holder of each warrant, upon the exercise thereof at any time after such distribution shall be entitled to receive the stock or other securities to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder had exercised such warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in this subsection 10.1; provided, however, that no adjustment in respect of dividends -7- 8 or interest on such stock or other securities shall be made during the term of a warrant or upon the exercise of a warrant. (d) for the purpose of any computation under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the current market price per share of common stock at any date shall be the average of the daily closing prices for 20 consecutive trading days commencing 30 trading days before the date of such computation. the closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price regular way or, in case no reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices regular way for such day, in each case on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of common stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading, the average of the closing bid and asked prices of the common stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by nasdaq or any comparable system. in the absence of one or more such quotations, the company shall determine the current market price on the basis of such quotations as it considers appropriate. (e) no adjustment in the number of warrant shares purchasable hereunder shall be required unless and until such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations shall be made to the nearest one-thousandth of a share. (f) whenever the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant is adjusted as provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, the warrant price payable upon exercise of each warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such warrant price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and of which the denominator shall be the number of warrant shares purchasable immediately thereafter. (g) no adjustment in the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant need be made under paragraphs (b) and (c) if the company issues or distributes to each holder of warrants the rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities, or evidence of indebtedness or assets referred to in those paragraphs which each holder of warrants would have been entitled to receive had the warrants been exercised prior to the happening of such event or the record date with respect thereto. no adjustment in the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant need be made for sales of warrant shares pursuant to a company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. no adjustment need be made for a change in the par value of the warrant shares. (h) for the purpose of this subsection 10.1, the term "shares of common stock" shall mean (i) the class of stock designated as the common stock of the company at the date of this agreement, or (ii) any other class of stock resulting from successive -8- 9 changes or reclassification of such shares consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. in the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the holders shall become entitled to purchase any shares of the company other than shares of common stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so purchasable upon exercise of each warrant and the warrant price of such shares shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the warrant shares contained in paragraph (a) through (c), inclusive, above, and the provisions of section 5 and subsections 10.2 through 10.4, inclusive, with respect to the warrant shares, shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (i) upon the expiration of any rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange privileges, if any thereof shall not have been exercised, the warrant price and the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant shall, upon such expiration, be readjusted and shall thereafter be such as it would have been had it been originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if (a) the only shares of common stock so issued were the shares of common stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights and (b) such shares of common stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration, if any, actually received by the company for the issuance, sale or grant of all such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights whether or not exercised; provided, further, that no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the warrant price by an amount in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made in respect to the issuance, sale or grant of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights. 10.2 determination of consideration. upon any issuance or sale for a consideration other than cash, or a consideration part of which is other than cash, of any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock or convertible securities, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the company shall be deemed to be the fair value of such consideration as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the company. in case any shares of common stock or convertible securities or any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock or convertible securities shall be issued or sold together with other shares, stock or securities or other assets of the company for a consideration which covers both, the consideration for the issue or sale of such shares of common stock or convertible securities or such rights or options shall be deemed to be the portion of such consideration allocated thereto in good faith by the board of directors of the company. 10.3 voluntary adjustment by the company. the company may at its option, at any time during the term of the warrants, reduce the then current warrant price to any amount deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the company. 10.4 notice of adjustment. whenever the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant or the warrant price of such warrant shares is -9- 10 adjusted, as herein provided, to an extent that such adjustment is equal to or greater than 5% of the warrant price in effect prior to such adjustment, the company shall cause the warrant agent promptly to mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments and shall deliver to the warrant agent a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants selected by the board of directors of the company (who may be the regular accountants employed by the company) setting forth the number of warrant shares purchasable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant price of such warrant shares after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. the warrant agent shall be entitled to rely on such certificate and shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate, except to exhibit the same, from time to time, to any holder desiring an inspection thereof during reasonable business hours. the warrant agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holders to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the warrant price or the number of warrant shares or other stock or property purchasable on exercise thereof, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making such adjustment. 10.5 no adjustment of dividends. except as provided in subsection 10.1, no adjustment in respect of any dividends shall be made during the term of a warrant or upon the exercise of a warrant. 10.6 preservation of purchase rights reclassification, consolidation, etc. in case of any consolidation of the company with or merger of the company into another corporation or in case of any sale, transfer or lease to another corporation of all or substantially all the property of the company, the company or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the warrant agent an agreement that (i) each holder shall have the right thereafter upon payment of the warrant price in effect immediately prior to such action to purchase upon exercise of each warrant the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property (including cash) which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease had such warrant been exercised immediately prior to such action; or (ii) in the event that all of the property to which a holder would be entitled to receive in such an action had such warrant been exercised immediately prior to such action is cash, then upon surrender of a certificate representing warrants each holder shall be entitled to receive cash in the amount of the difference between the amount which such holder would have paid to exercise such warrants in full at the warrant price in effect immediately prior to such action and the amount of cash which he would have been entitled to receive after the happening of such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease had such warrant been exercised immediately prior to such action; provided, however, that no adjustment in respect of dividends, interest or other income on or from such shares or other securities and property shall be made during the term of a warrant or upon the exercise of a warrant. the company shall mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each holder, notice of the execution of any such agreement. such agreement shall provide for adjustments, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this section 10. the provisions of this subsection 10.6 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or leases. the warrant agent shall be under no duty or responsibility to determine the correctness of any -10- 11 provisions contained in any such agreement relating to the kind or amount of shares of stock or other securities or property receivable upon exercise of warrants or with respect to the method employed and provided therein for any adjustments and shall be entitled to rely upon the provisions contained in any such agreement. 10.7 statement on warrants. irrespective of any adjustments in the warrant price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants, warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the warrants initially issuable pursuant to this agreement. section 11. fractional interests. the company shall not be required to issue fractional warrant shares on the exercise of warrants. if more than one warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same holder, the number of full warrant shares which shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of warrant shares purchasable on exercise of the warrants so presented. if any fraction of a warrant share would, except for the provisions of this section 11, be issuable on the exercise of any warrant (or specified portion thereof), the warrant agent shall pay (and shall be promptly reimbursed by the company upon demand therefor) an amount in cash equal to the closing price for one share of the common stock, as defined in paragraph (d) of subsection 10.1, on the trading day immediately preceding the date the warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction. section 12. no rights as stockholders; notices to holders. nothing contained in this agreement or in any of the warrants shall be construed as conferring upon the holders or their transferees the right to vote or to receive dividends or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors of the company or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as stockholders of the company. if, however, at any time prior to the expiration of the warrants and prior to their exercise, any of the following events shall occur: (a) the company shall declare any dividend payable in any securities upon its shares of common stock or make any distribution (other than a cash dividend as to which no adjustment in the warrant price is to be made as herein provided) to the holders of its shares of common stock; or (b) the company shall offer to the holders of its shares of common stock any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or any right to subscribe thereto; or (c) a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company (other than in connection with a consolidation, merger, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its property, assets, and business as an entirety) shall be proposed. then in any one or more of said events the company shall (a) give notice in writing of such event to the warrant agent and the holders as provided in section 18 hereof and (b) cause notice of such event to be published once in the wall street journal, such giving of notice and publication -11- 12 to be completed at least 20 days prior to the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the transfer books for the determination of the stockholders entitled to such dividend, distribution, or subscription rights, or for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such proposed dissolution, liquidation or winding up. such notice shall specify such record date or the date of closing the transfer books, as the case may be. failure to publish or mail such notice or any defect therein or in the publication or mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of any action taken in connection with such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or such proposed dissolution, liquidation or winding up. section 13. disposition of proceeds on exercise of warrants;

and in case at that time any of the warrants shall not have been countersigned, any successor to the warrant agent may countersign such warrants either in the name of the predecessor warrant agent or in the name of the successor warrant agent; and in all such cases warrants shall have the full force provided in the warrants and in this agreement. in case at any time the name of the warrant agent shall be changed and at such time any of the warrants shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the warrant agent may adopt the countersignatures under its prior name and deliver such warrants so countersigned;
