(30) days from the date of such transfer notice. 1.4. if the transferor receives one or more offers to purchase, the transferor must accept all, but not less than all, of such offers to purchase, whereupon each participating -2- shareholder shall have thirty (30) days from the date of its offer to purchase to pay for the offered shares, within which period each such participating shareholder must obtain any requisite polish or other governmental approvals; provided, however that, if such participating shareholder has made all necessary filings and taken all other actions reasonably required to obtain such approval but nevertheless fails to obtain such approvals within such thirty-day period, the participating shareholder shall be required to obtain such approvals and pay for such offered shares as soon as practicable, but not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days thereafter, during which additional period interest on the purchase price to be paid by the participating shareholder shall accrue and be payable by the participating shareholder upon the payment thereof at the rate of seven percent (7%) per annum. if, pursuant to section 1.3.1 or 1.3.2(i) above, more than one among the participating shareholders submits an offer to purchase, the transfer shares shall be sold by the transferor to such participating shareholders pro rata based upon their then relative (as among themselves) current ownership of shares. 1.5. in the event that any transfer of shares pursuant to this section i requires a polish or other governmental approval and such approval requires a filing, provision of information or some other action to be taken by the company, the company undertakes to use all reasonable efforts to make such filing, provide such information and take such action so as to enable such approval to be obtained within the time limits provided for the sale and purchase of the transfer shares pursuant to section 1.4 above. in the event that such approvals are not obtained by a participating shareholder within the time limits specified in section 1.4 above, then such participating shareholder will have no obligation to purchase any of the transfer shares, shall not be deemed a defaulting shareholder (as defined in section 1.6 below) and shall not be deemed to have submitted an offer to purchase for purposes of section 1.7 below. transfer of the transfer shares to any participating shareholder will take place simultaneously with payment by that participating shareholder for those transfer shares, but otherwise in all respects on the same terms as set out in the transfer notice. 1.6. if any participating shareholder who makes an offer to purchase defaults on its obligation to pay for the transfer shares in accordance with section 1.4 (a "defaulting shareholder"), then, in addition to any other rights that the transferor may have under applicable law or otherwise, the defaulting shareholder shall no longer have the right to receive transfer notices or make offers to purchase with respect to any future proposed transfers by other shareholders. in the case of such a default (or in the case of a participating shareholder who has not obtained the necessary consents and approvals within the time frame set forth in section 1.4 above), (i) if one or more participating shareholders other than the defaulting shareholder (or the participating shareholder who failed to obtain the necessary consents and approvals) have made an offer to purchase, then the transfer shares shall be sold to such other participating shareholder(s) on a pro rata basis based upon their relative (as among themselves) ownership of shares as at the commencement of the offer period and (ii) if no participating shareholders other than the defaulting shareholder (or the participating shareholder who failed to obtain the necessary consents and approvals) have made an offer to purchase, then the transfer shares as to which such offer to purchase was made can be sold to a third party as provided in section 1.7. -3- 1.7. if none of the participating shareholders submit an offer to purchase or if the circumstances contemplated by clause (ii) of the last sentence of section 1.6 above apply, then the transferor shall have the right, exercisable not later than one-hundred and twenty (i 20) days following the expiration of all relevant offer periods, or such longer period as may be necessary to effect a demand registration pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into in connection with this agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as exhibit a (the "registration rights agreement"), and upon written notice to the other parties (which notice shall include the identity of the party to which the transfer shares are being transferred), to consummate the transfer of all or any portion of the transfer shares to any other persons at a price not lower than the price, and upon the terms (other than the identity of the possible purchaser), set forth in the transfer notice. if the transferor does not consummate such transfer within such one-hundred and twenty (120) -day period, or such longer period as may be necessary to effect a demand registration pursuant to the registration rights agreement, such transfer shares shall again be subject in all respects to the terms, conditions and restrictions provided in this section 1. 1.8. the right of first offer provided in this section i shall not apply to: 1.8.1. any sale of shares by any of the shareholders under rule 144 of the u.s. securities act of 1933; 1.8.2. any transfers among each other by any of dankner, trefoil, shamrock and the gscp entities; provided that in such case the transferor shall notify each of the other shareholders of the number of shares transferred and the identity of the transferee; 1.8.3. any transfers among each other by any of the wp entities; provided that in such case the transferor shall notify each of the other shareholders of the number of shares transferred and the identity of the transferee; 1.8.4. any sale of shares by any of the shareholders for which such shareholder(s) has exercised piggyback rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement; and 1.8.5. any transfer by any participating shareholder to any of its affiliates (an "affiliate transferee") which, solely for this purpose, (a) in the case of telia, shall include the unisource venture or one or more of the unisource shareholders, (b) in the case of dankner, shall also include matav cable systems media ltd. ("matav") for as long as that entity is directly or indirectly controlled by dankner and (c) in the case of trefoil, shall include its partners in connection with the dissolution of trefoil, provided that such partners shall appoint stanley p. gold or robert moskowitz (or such other person or entity as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the shareholders) to act as sole representative for such partners with respect to all of the shares (and related rights) so transferred to them, and such person or entity shall remain the sole representative for as long as such partners own such shares; and provided further that in each case contained in this section 1.8.3, the affiliate transferee complies with section 1.9 below. -5- 1.9. in each case referred to in section 1.8.5, the affiliate transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this agreement, and if the affiliate transferee ceases to be an affiliate of such shareholder (except if the transferring shareholder is dankner, the affiliate transferee is matav and matav has held such shares for at least two (2) years), such affiliate transferee shall be required to offer to sell the shares transferred to such transferee to the other shareholders in accordance with section 1.1 above, within fifteen (i 5) days of the date upon which the affiliate transferee ceases to be an affiliate of such shareholder, at the market price for such shares. for purposes of the foregoing, "market price" shall be deemed to be the average closing price for the shares on the nasdaq national market or, if the shares are not listed on the nasdaq national market, such other principal securities exchange on which the shares are traded during the ten (10) days prior to the date of the applicable transfer notice. 1.10. the provisions set forth in this section i shall not apply to: (i) sales by the wp entities of shares in unsolicited open market transactions to buyers in respect of whom there had been no pre-arrangements made by the wp entities regarding such sales; (ii) bona fide underwritten public offerings; or (iii) distributions by the wp entities of shares to the partners in its partnerships, provided that such distributions are not part of a plan or arrangement to transfer all or a substantial portion of the shares held by the wp entities to any particular person or entity. 1.11. a transfer of shares to a depository shall not be deemed a transfer under this agreement; provided that the depository receipts issued upon such deposit shall be deemed to be shares for purposes of this agreement. 1.12. for purposes of this section i only, (i) the gscp entities and their permitted controlled affiliate transferees shall be treated as one shareholder, (ii) shamrock and trefoil and their permitted controlled affiliate transferees shall be treated as one shareholder, (iii) dankner and its permitted controlled affiliate transferees shall be treated as one shareholder, (iv) telia and its permitted controlled affiliate transferees shall be treated as one shareholder and (v) the wp entities and their permitted controlled affiliate transferees shall be treated as one shareholder. in this agreement, "affiliate" shall mean any firm, company or corporation which a party shall directly or indirectly control, is controlled by or is under common control with. as used in the preceding sentence, "control" means the right to exercise, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting rights attributable to the shares of the controlled entity, or the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of the controlled entity. 2. non-competition each of the shareholders agrees that, for so long as such shareholder owns five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding voting securities of the company or, if sooner, upon the termination of this agreement with respect to such shareholder, and in each case for a period of one (1) year thereafter, such shareholder and its respective subsidiaries, officers and directors shall not directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, join, control or participate in, be compensated by or invest in or be connected with any telecommunication entity, or otherwise engage in any telecommunications activities (such as fixed-line, cellular, value-added, cpe, and content provisions such as for catv), in any such case, in the territory of the republic of poland, -6- other than the company and its subsidiaries; provided, however, that this section 2 shall not apply to the following: 2.1. the wireless public trunked radio activities of uninet sp. z o.o., an affiliate of the company; 2.2.

proposed registration to all other holders holding registrable securities; and 2.1.2. as soon as practicable, use its best efforts to effect such registration (including, without limitation, the execution of an undertaking to file posteffective amendments, appropriate qualifications under foreign, blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with applicable regulations issued under the securities act), as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such registrable securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the registrable securities of any holder(s) joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice from the company in accordance with the provisions of section 2.2 hereof (such holder(s) being referred to as "participating holders"); provided that the company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this section 2. 1: (i) in any particular jurisdiction in which the company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance, unless the company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be

pursuant to a request made pursuant to this section 2. l subject to the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) and to section 2.1.5 (below), the company shall file a registration statement covering the registrable securities so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the request from the requesting initiating holders. 2.1.3. underwriting. if the requesting initiating holder(s) intend to distribute the registrable securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the company as part of their request made pursuant to section 2.1 and the company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in section 2.1.1. the right of any holder to registration pursuant to section 2.1 shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such registrable securities in the underwriting to the extent requested (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the requesting initiating holders and such holder to the extent provided herein). 2.1.4. underwriting agreement/withdrawals. the company shall (together with all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement (an "underwriting agreement") in such form and containing such provisions as are customary in the securities business for such an arrangement between such underwriter and companies of the company's size and investment status (it being understood that the company will not require any requesting initiating holder or participating holder to make any representation, warranty or agreement in such underwriting agreement other than with respect to such requesting initiating holder's or participating holder's ownership of the shares being registered and such requesting initiating holder's or participating holder's intended method of disposition) with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority in interest of the registrable securities held by those participating holders participating in such registration and approved by the company (such approval not to be -3- unreasonably withheld). the rights of the requesting initiating holders and participating holders and the company to participate in such registration shall be subject to the cutback provisions of section 2.2-2. no registrable securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. if any holder owning registrable securities disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the company, the underwriter and the requesting initiating holders. the registrable securities and/or other securities so withdrawn from such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from such registration; provided, however, that if by the withdrawal of such registrable securities a greater number of registrable securities held by other holders may be included in such registration (up to the maximum of any limitation imposed by the underwriters), then the company shall offer to all participating holders the right to include additional registrable securities in the same proportion used in determining the underwriter limitation in this section. 2.1.5. right to delay a demand registration. if at the time of any request to register registrable securities pursuant to this section, (i) the company is preparing a registration statement for a public offering (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable) which in fact is filed and becomes effective within ninety (90) days after the request, or (ii) the company's supervisory board determines, in good faith, that effecting such a registration would require the company to make public disclosure of information, the public disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect upon the company, then the company may at its option direct that such request be delayed, in the case of clause (i), for a period not in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the effective date of such registration, such right to delay a request pursuant to clause (i) of this section 2.1.5 to be exercised by the company not more than once during the term of this agreement or in the case of clause (ii), for a period not in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the request, such right to delay a request pursuant to clause (ii) of this section 2.1.5 to be exercised by the company not more than once in any twelve month period. nothing in this section shall preclude a holder of registrable securities from enjoying registration rights which it might otherwise possess under this agreement. 2.1.6. certain registrations not to be counted. in the event that the transactions contemplated by the underwriting agreement executed in connection with a requested registration pursuant to section 2.1 are not consummated due to a breach by the company of any of its representations and warranties or obligations thereunder (it being understood that a failure to close due to changes in market conditions shall not constitute such a breach), such request for registration shall not be counted for purposes of section 2.1.2.(iv). in addition, in the event that as a result of the application of limitations on the number of shares of registrable securities held by a requesting initiating holder to be included in a registration, less than 50% of the shares of registrable securities that such requesting initiating holder originally requested to be registered are actually registered, the requesting initiating holder may elect to either (i) proceed with such registration, in -4- which case such registration shall count for purposes of section 2.1.2.(iv), or (ii) withdraw from such registration, in which case such registration shall not count for purposes of section 2.1.2.(iv) but only if such requesting initiating holder reimburses the company for all registration expenses (as defined herein) incurred by the company in connection with such registration. 2.2. piggyback registration. 2.2.1. the company's obligation to register. if the company at any time proposes to initiate a registration of its securities under the securities act on its own or upon request of any other persons (including any requesting initiating holders) and thereafter registers any of its securities under the securities act (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan, a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable or any other form or type of registration in which registrable securities cannot be included pursuant to commission rule or practice), it will give written notice to all holders of the outstanding registrable securities of its intention to do so (stating the intended method and terms of disposition of such securities, including a list of the jurisdictions in which the company intends to qualify such securities). if such registration is proposed to be on a form which permits inclusion of the registrable securities, upon the written request from any holder within twenty (20) days after transmittal by the company to the holders of such notice, the company will, subject to the limits contained in this section, use its best efforts to cause all such registrable securities of said holders to be registered under the securities act and qualified for sale under any state blue sky law, all to the extent requisite to permit such sale or other disposition by such holders of the registrable securities so registered. the holders' registration rights under this section 2.2.1 shall be in addition to their rights under section 2. 1. 2.2.2. cutbacks. notwithstanding any other provision of section 2.1 or this section 2.2, if the underwriter(s) managing the applicable registration determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares of common stock and registrable securities that may be included in such registration and so advises the company and the requesting initiating holders (if any) in writing, then the company shall so advise all participating holders exercising their piggyback rights pursuant to section and the number of shares of common stock and registrable securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated as follows: (i) in the case of a registration initiated by the company on its own, first to the company and thereafter to the participating holders of such registrable securities pro rata based on the number of shares of registrable securities that such participating holders have requested to be included in such registration; and (h) in the case of a registration initiated by a requesting initiating holder(s) pursuant to section 2.1 or by another person having the right to demand such a registration, first to such requesting initiating holder(s) (in the event there are more than one requesting initiating holder, pro rata based on the number of shares of registrable securities that such requesting initiating holders have demanded to be included in such registration) or to such other person as the case may be (but subject, in the event that such requesting holder is dankner or shamrock and trefoil or any of the -5- gscp entities, to the provisions of section 2.2.3 below), and thereafter to the company (if the company wishes to include any shares of common stock in such registration) and to the participating holders of such registrable securities pro rata based, in the case of the company, on the number of shares of common stock that the company wishes to include in such registration (but not more than the largest number of shares of registrable securities requested to be included in such registration by any participating holder), and in the case of participating holders, on the number of shares of registrable securities that such participating holders have requested to be included in such registration, respectively. 2.2.3. the parties acknowledge and agree that if either (i) dankner or (ii) shamrock and trefoil (as one holder) or (iii) any of the gscp entities, is the requesting initiating holder of a registration under section 2.1, then any of dankner, shamrock, trefoil and the gscp entities shall also be treated as requesting initiating holders (except for purposes of section 2.1.2.(iv)) as to any shares they propose to include in such registration pursuant to this section 2.2. in that event, the total number of shares includable in any such registration by dankner, shamrock, trefoil and the gscp entities (and their respective assignees), determined as provided in clause 2.2.2 above, shall be allocated among such parties on the basis agreed to in writing by dankner, shamrock, trefoil and the gscp entities. 2.3. form s-3. 2.3.1. obligation to register. the company shall use its best efforts to qualify for registration on form s-3 (or comparable form for a foreign issuer). after the company has qualified for the use of form s-3, the initiating holders of registrable securities shall have the right to request registrations on form s-3 thereafter, as the case may be (but the holders, as a group, may not make more than three (3) such requests in any twelve (12) month period and no more than six (6) such request(s) in the aggregate) under this section (such requests shall be in writing and shall state the number of shares of registrable securities to be disposed of and the intended method of disposition of such shares by such holder or holders), provided that the company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this section unless (i) the holder or holders requesting registration propose to dispose of registrable securities which they reasonably anticipate will have an aggregate offering price (before deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses of sale) of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), or (ii) the company has initiated a proposed registration as described in section 2. 1. 2.3.2. notice. the company shall give written notice to all holders of registrable securities of the receipt of a request for registration pursuant to this section 2.3 and shall permit such other holders to participate in the registration upon their request thereto given within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice. subject to the foregoing, the company will use its best efforts to effect promptly the registration of all shares of registrable securities on form s-3, to the extent requested by the holders thereof for purposes of disposition. the company need not register shares on form s-3 (or comparable form) in any jurisdiction in which the company does not qualify to do business. if at the time of any request to register registrable securities pursuant to this -6- section 2.3, (i) the company is preparing a registration statement for a public offering (other than a registration effected solely to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which rule 145 of the commission is applicable) which in fact is filed and becomes effective within ninety (90) days after the request, or (ii) the company's supervisory board determines, in good faith, that effecting such a registration would require the company to make public disclosure of information, the public disclosure of which would have a material adverse effect upon the company, then the company may at its option direct that such request be delayed, in the case of clause (i), for a period not in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the effective date of such registration, such right to delay a request pursuant to clause (i) of this section 2.3.2 to be exercised by the company not more than once during the term of this agreement or in the case of clause (h), for a period not in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the request, such right to delay a request pursuant to clause (ii) of this section 2.3.2 to be exercised by the company not more than once in any twelve month period. 2.4. registration procedures. if and whenever the company is required by the provisions of this agreement to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any registrable securities under the securities act, the company will, as expeditiously as possible: 2.4.1. prepare and file with the commission a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for the period provided in this section; 2.4.2. prepare and file with the commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the securities act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement whenever the seller or sellers of such securities shall desire to sell or otherwise dispose of the same, but only to the extent provided in this section; 2.4.3. furnish to each seller of registered securities and to each underwriter such number of copies of the registration statement and the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other documents, as such persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the securities owned by such seller and covered by such registration statement; 2.4.4. use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other united states, foreign or state blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each seller or, in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter, shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary under such securities or blue sky laws to enable such seller to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions of the -7- securities owned by such seller, except that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify to do business as a foreign company in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified or intends to be so qualified prior to the effective date of the applicable registration statement; 2.4.5. use its reasonable best efforts to list the registrable securities covered by such registration statement with any securities exchange or market on which the common stock of the company, if applicable, is then listed or quoted; 2.4.6. notify each seller of registrable securities and each underwriter under such registration statement as promptly as practicable at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the securities act, of the happening of any event of which the company has knowledge as result of which, in the company's reasonable judgment, the prospectus contained in such registration statement, as then in effect, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements, therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; 2.4.7. before filing the registration statement or prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to one counsel selected by a majority of the voting interests of the participating holders of registrable securities copies of such documents proposed to be filed which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of such counsel; 2.4.8. furnish on the date the registrable securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration to each prospective seller a signed counterpart, addressed to the prospective seller, of (i) an opinion of counsel for the company, dated such date stating that such registration statement has become effective under the securities act and that (a) to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the securities act, (b) the registration statement, the related prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereof comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the securities act (except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements contained therein) and (c) to such other effects as reasonably may be requested by counsel for the underwriters or by such seller or its counsel, and (ii) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the company's financial statements included in the registration statement, stating that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the securities act and that, in the opinion of such accountants, the financial statements of the company included in the registration statement or the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the securities act, and such letter shall additionally cover such other financial matters with respect to such registration as such underwriters reasonably may request; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the company shall not in any event be required to use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement for a period in excess of one hundred eighty (i 80) days; -8- 2.4.9.

and 2.4.10. enter into such agreements and take such other actions as the sellers of registrable securities and the underwriters reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such registrable securities, including but not limited to participating in road shows and other customary selling efforts. 2.5. registration expenses. as used herein, "registration expenses" shall mean all expenses incurred by the company in complying with sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 hereof, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees; printing expenses; fees and disbursements of counsel for the company; fees and disbursements of one counsel for all the selling shareholders of the registrable securities; blue sky fees and expenses; foreign securities laws fees and expenses; and the expense of any special audits incident to or required by any such registration (but excluding the compensation of regular employees of the company which shall be paid in any event by the company); and "selling expenses" shall mean all underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the sales thereunder. except as specifically provided in section 2.1.6, the company will pay all registration expenses in connection with the registrations pursuant to sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, regardless of which initiating holders have requested registration pursuant to sections 2.1 or 2.2. all selling expenses in connection with each registration pursuant to sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 shall be borne by the company and the selling holders pro rata in proportion to the registrable securities covered thereby being sold by them. 2.6. indemnification. 2.6.1. indemnification by the company. in the event of any registration of any of its securities under the securities act pursuant to this agreement, the company shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the following parties: each seller of such securities; (ii) each underwriter (as defined in the securities act); (iii) each other person who is an officer, director or partner of such seller or who participates in the offering of such securities; and (iv)each other person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the securities act) such seller, underwriter or participating person against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as incurred (collectively the "liability"), joint or several, to which such seller, underwriter, participating person or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or any other statute or at common law, insofar as such liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under -9- which such securities were registered under the securities act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (y) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (z) any violation by the company of the securities act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder or any foreign securities rules or regulations applicable to the company in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, except as otherwise provided in section 2.6.2 below. except as otherwise provided in section 2.6.4 below, the company shall reimburse each such seller, underwriter, participating person or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such liability, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the company shall not be liable to any seller, underwriters, participating persons, or controlling persons in any such case to the extent that any such liability arises out of or is based upon any statement or alleged omission made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such person to be specifically stated for use therein; the company shall not be required to indemnify any person against any liability arising from any untrue or alleged untrue or misleading statement or omission or alleged omission contained in any preliminary prospectus if such deficiency is corrected in the final prospectus and liability arises out of the failure of any person to deliver a prospectus as required by the securities act. the indemnity provided for in this section shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller, underwriter, participating person or controlling person and shall survive transfer of such securities by such seller. 2.6.2. indemnification by holders of registrable securities. each holder of any registrable securities shall, in the event of a registration of any of its registrable securities under the securities act pursuant to sections 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the company, its directors and officers, each underwriter and each other person, if any, who controls the company or such underwriter, against any liability, joint or several, as incurred, to which the company, underwriter or any such director or officer or controlling person may become subject under the securities act or any other statute or at common law, in so far as such liability (or actions in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement under which such registrable securities were registered under the securities act at the request of such holder pursuant to this agreement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided however, that no holder of registrable securities shall be required to indemnify any person against any liability arising from any untrue or alleged untrue or misleading statement or omission or alleged omission contained in any preliminary prospectus if such deficiency is corrected in the final prospectus and liability arises out of the failure of any person to deliver a prospectus as required by the securities act. notwithstanding the above, the indemnification set forth in this section 2.6.2 shall be -10- given to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the company by such holder and expressly stated for use therein. such holder shall reimburse the company, such underwriter or such director, officer, or controlling person for any legal fees incurred in investigating or defending any such liability, as incurred; provided, that the obligations of such holder of registrable securities for the indemnity hereunder shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such holder of registrable securities from the sale of registrable securities covered by such registration statement and shall not extend to any settlement of claims related thereto without the express written consent of such holder of registrable securities. 2.6.3. further indemnity. indemnification similar to that specified in sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 shall be given by the company and each holder of any registrable securities (with such modifications as may be appropriate) with respect to any required registration or other qualification of the common stock under any federal, foreign or state law or regulation of governmental authority other than the securities act. 2.6.4. procedures, rights to separate counsel. (i) each party entitled to indemnification under this section 2.6 (the "indemnified party") shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "indemnifying party") promptly after such indemnified party has received written notice of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, unless there shall be a conflict of interest; provided that counsel for the indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the indemnified party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at such indemnified party's expense; and provided further that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this section 2.6 unless such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or any such litigation. the indemnified party shall also have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the indemnifying party unless either (a) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, there are defenses available to the indemnified party that are not available to the indemnifying party or representation of the indemnified party by counsel for the indemnifying party would present a conflict of interest for such counsel, or (b) the indemnifying party fails to promptly defend, in which case the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified party shall be borne by the indemnifying party. no indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. -11- (ii) in order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the securities act in any case in which either (a) any indemnified party exercising rights under this agreement, or any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section but is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this section provides for indemnification in such cases, (b) contribution under the securities act may be required on the part of any such selling holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this section or (c) the indemnification provided for by this section is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, other than by reason of the exceptions provided therein; then, and in each such case, the company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liability to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) (x) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other or (y) if the allocation provided by clause (x) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relevant fault referred to in clause (x) above but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party and the indemnified party from the offering of the securities (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering received by each such party) as well as the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities and any other relevant equitable considerations. no person will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the proceeds received by such person in respect of all such registrable securities offered and sold by it pursuant to such registration statement and no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 2.7. termination of registration rights. the rights to registration and the designation of common stock as registrable securities shall terminate as to any particular securities when such securities shall have been lawfully sold by the holder thereof to the public pursuant to a registration statement or after a sale thereof pursuant to rule 144. 2.8. compliance with rule 144. with a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the commission which may at any time permit the sale of registrable securities to the public without registration, at all times ninety (90) days after any registration statement covering a public offering of securities of the company under the securities act shall have become effective, the company agrees to: -12- 2.8.1. make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 under the securities act; 2.8.2. use its best efforts to file with the commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities act and the exchange act; and 2.8.3. furnish to each holder of registrable securities forthwith upon request a written statement by the company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of such rule 144 and of the securities act and the exchange act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company, and such other reports and documents so filed by the company as such holder may reasonably request availing itself of any rule or regulation of the commission allowing such holder to sell any registrable securities without registration. 2.9. assignability of registration rights. the registration rights set forth in this agreement are assignable by any holder to each assignee (a "permitted assignee") of at least 33.3% of the registrable securities owned by such holder on the date of this agreement (appropriately adjusted for recapitalizations) who agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement within ten (10) days of such assignment. the term "seller" as used in this agreement refers to a holder of the registrable securities selling such shares. 2.10. rights which may not be granted to subsequent investors. the company shall not grant registration rights or enter into any registration rights agreement or similar agreement with any person after the date hereof which are superior to the rights granted hereunder. 2.11. information by holder. the

to in this section. 3. miscellaneous. 3.1. consent to amendments. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions of this agreement may be amended and the company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by them, only if it has obtained the written consent of each of the holders. no course of dealing between the company and any holder or any delay in -13- exercising any rights hereunder or under the company's articles of incorporation will operate as a waiver of any rights of any such holders. 3.2. successors and assigns. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants and agreements contained in this agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto whether so expressed or not. 3.3. severability. each provision of this agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this agreement. 3.4. counterparts. this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 3.5. descriptive headings. the descriptive headings of this agreement are
