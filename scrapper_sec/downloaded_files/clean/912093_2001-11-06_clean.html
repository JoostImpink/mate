(b)&#9;no dividends shall be paid on any share of common stock during any fiscal year of the corporation until dividends in the total amount of $15.00 per share (adjusted for any subdivisions, combinations, consolidations or stock distributions or stock dividends with respect to such shares) on the preferred stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart during that fiscal year and any prior year in which dividends accumulated but remain unpaid, and no dividends shall be paid on any share of common stock unless a dividend is paid with respect to all outstanding shares of preferred stock, in an amount for each such share of preferred stock equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of such dividends for all shares of common stock into which each such share of preferred stock could then be converted, as the case may be. 2.&#9; liquidation preference . in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, distributions to the shareholders of the corporation shall be made in the following manner: (a)&#9;the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the corporation to the holders of the common stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the amount equal to $250.00 (adjusted for any subdivisions, combinations, consolidations or stock distributions or stock dividends with respect to the preferred stock) (the " initial preferred stock price ") for each share of preferred stock then held by them and, in addition, an amount equal to all cumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock. if upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the entire assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the preferred stock on a pro rata basis, based upon the number of shares of preferred stock then held by each holder. (b)&#9;after setting apart or paying in full the preferential amounts due pursuant to section 2(a), the remaining assets of the corporation available for distribution to shareholders, if any, shall be distributed to the holders of the common stock on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of common stock then held by each holder on an as-converted basis.

(e)&#9;in the event the corporation proposes to distribute assets other than cash in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the value of the assets to be distributed to the holder of shares of preferred stock and common stock shall be determined in good faith by the board of directors. any securities not subject to investment letter or similar restrictions on free marketability shall be valued as follows: (i)&#9;if traded on the nasdaq stock market or another securities exchange, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the security's closing prices on nasdaq or such exchange over the thirty trading (30) day period ending on and including the day immediately preceding the distribution; and (ii)&#9;if actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the thirty trading (30) day period ending on and including the day immediately preceding the distribution. the method of valuation of securities subject to investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability shall be adjusted to make an appropriate discount from the market value determined as in clauses (i) or (ii) to reflect the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the board of directors, which determination shall be final and conclusive. 3.&#9; voting rights. except as otherwise required by law or as set forth herein, the holder of each share of common stock issued and outstanding shall have one vote for each share of common stock held by such holder, and the holder of each share of preferred stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such share of preferred stock could be converted assuming a conversion rate equal to (a) the initial preferred stock price divided by (b) 8.18. holders of common stock and preferred stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders' meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation. 4.&#9; conversion. the holders of the preferred stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the " conversion rights "): (a)&#9; right to convert. subject to section 6, each share of preferred stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date on which the shares of preferred stock are originally issued (the " original issue date "), (ii) the public announcement of a liquidity event or (iii) the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in section 5(a)). each such share shall be convertible into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined in accordance with section 5. the date of any conversion of the preferred stock under this section 4 is referred to as the " conversion date ". (b)&#9; automatic conversion. subject to sections 5(g) and 6, each share of preferred stock shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion rate determined in accordance with section 5 hereof upon and after the third anniversary of the original issue date.

(d)&#9; adjustments for stock dividends, subdivisions, combinations or consolidations of common stock . in the event, prior to conversion of the preferred stock, the outstanding shares of common stock shall be (i) subdivided (by stock dividend, stock split, or otherwise) into a greater number of shares of common stock, or (ii) consolidated or combined (by a reverse stock split or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of common stock, then, in either case, the conversion rates described in sections 5(b) and 5(c) shall be proportionately increased or decreased, as applicable. (e)&#9; adjustments for other distributions. in the event the corporation at any time or from time to time makes, or files a record date for the determination of, holders of common stock entitled to receive any distribution payable in securities or assets of the corporation other than shares of common stock then in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of preferred stock shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of common stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities or assets of the corporation which they would have received had their preferred stock been converted into common stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities or assets receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustment called for during such period under this section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the preferred stock. (f)&#9; adjustments for reclassification, exchange and substitution. if the common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or another entity (including without limitation, pursuant to a liquidity event), whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then and in each such event the holder of each share of preferred stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization or reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of common stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the preferred stock immediately before that change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (g) &#9;miscellaneous . (i)&#9;the preferred stock shall not be convertible, in the aggregate, into 20% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation. no holder of preferred stock may convert shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock if, and to the extent, after giving effect to such conversion, such holder shall hold, in the aggregate, 20% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation. the foregoing shall not affect the applicable conversion rate and any shares of preferred stock not permitted to be converted pursuant to this section 5(g)(i) shall be immediately convertible, unless redeemed in accordance with section 6, at such time as such holder subsequently holds, in the aggregate, less than 20% of such securities. the conversion date for automatic conversion specified in section 4 shall be extended as required to permit the full conversion of all preferred stock pursuant to this paragraph. (ii)&#9;calculations under this section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of a share, as the case may be. (iii)&#9;no adjustment in the conversion rate of the preferred stock need be made if such adjustment would result in a change in such conversion rate of less than 0.5%. any adjustment of less than 0.5% which is not made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, on a cumulative basis, amounts to an adjustment of 0.5% or more in such conversion rate. 6.&#9; redemption. (a)&#9; redemption right. the corporation shall, subject to the provisions of this section 6, have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem from each holder of excess shares elected to be converted, any or all of such excess shares, effective on the day immediately prior to the conversion date applicable to such excess shares (each a " redemption date ") as provided in clause (c). (b)&#9; redemption price. any excess shares elected to be redeemed by the corporation shall be redeemed at a price per excess share equal to the sum of the initial preferred stock price, plus all cumulated and unpaid dividends (the " series a redemption price "). such series a redemption price for all excess shares to be redeemed shall be paid in the form of a senior unsecured promissory note bearing interest from and after the redemption date at the rate of 6% per annum, maturing two (2) years after the redemption date and prepayable in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. (c)&#9; notice of redemption . at least five (5) days prior to any redemption date, the corporation shall send a notice (a " redemption notice ") to all holders of excess shares to be redeemed setting forth (a) the series a redemption price for the shares to be redeemed; (b) the redemption date, and (c) the place at which such holders may obtain payment of the series a redemption price upon surrender of their share certificates. if the corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares to be redeemed at the redemption date, then it shall redeem such shares pro rata from the holders thereof to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares to be redeemed as soon as sufficient funds are legally available. (d)&#9; mechanics of redemption. on or after such redemption date, each holder of shares of excess shares to be redeemed shall surrender such holder's certificates representing such shares to the corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the redemption notice, and thereupon the series a redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. in the event less than all the shares represented by such certificates are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. from and after such redemption date, unless the corporation is unable to pay the series a redemption price due to not having sufficient legally available funds, all rights of the holder of such excess shares (except the right to receive the series a redemption price, without interest upon surrender of their certificates), shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided that in the event that shares of series a preferred are not redeemed because the corporation does not have sufficient legally available funds, such shares of series a preferred shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights and preferences provided herein. (e)&#9; conversion rights after redemption notice. in the event of a call for redemption of any shares of series a preferred, the conversion rights set forth in section 4 for such series a preferred shall terminate as to the shares designated for redemption at the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date. 7.&#9;protective provisions . so long as any shares of preferred stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the then- outstanding shares of preferred stock, take any action that: (a)&#9;alters the rights, preferences or privileges of the preferred stock; (b)&#9;increases the number of authorized shares of preferred stock; (b)&#9;creates any new class or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the preferred stock with respect to voting, dividends, or liquidation preferences; (c)&#9;reclassifies stock into shares having a preference over or on a parity with the preferred stock with respect to voting, dividends or liquidation preferences; or (d)&#9;supplements, amends or modifies this statement of preferences. _________________________________ brian r. carlisle, president _________________________________ bruce e. shimano, secretary each of the undersigned declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california that he has read the foregoing certificate and knows the contents thereof and that the same is true of his own knowledge. dated: october __, 2001 _________________________________ brian r. carlisle _________________________________ bruce e. shimano 40145753_5.doc graphic 4 jdslogo.jpg logo begin 644 jdslogo.jpg m_]c_x``02d9)1@`!`0$`8`!@``#_vp!#``,"`@,"`@,#`p,$`p,$!0@%!00$ m!0h'!p8(#`h,#`l*"pl-#a(0#0x1#@l+$!80$1,4%145#`\7&!84&!(4%13_ mvp!#`0,$!`4$!0d%!0d4#0l-%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04 m%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!04%!3_p``1"``[`1\#`2(``a$!`q$!_\0` m'p```04!`0$!`0$```````````$"`p0%!@ 7j#a(6&axb)bi*3e)66eyb9fj*ci*6fizbijk*sm+6vm[bynl+#q,7& mq\c)rm+3u-76u]c9vn'bx^3eyn?hz>kq\o/t]?;w^/gz_\0`'p$``p$!`0$! m`0$!`0````````$"`p0%!@ 'ez@h.$ ma8:'b(f*di.4e9:7f)f:hj.di::gj*fjlk.tm;:wn+fzpl/$q ;gz.gj\o/t]?;w^/gz_]h`#`,!``(1`q$`/p#]4z**xwxm m?%opu\$o!%[xj\57ov33;;"(d8w37,i^y#$f1n=l'`x``+,0jlpn$)5)*$%= mo9";45=g3zk?q:9i\]w,vv.%"qy`sz`9[dx`^m>1z?x\ug3w9a p('m62/vj?@[\5=#n[?2/b;h=ay+ky@uf1m.\s@d!1 _$[_6g"8^a4r^c5a3iq?o13ud mwk=+6r27q*v_ )c' p!_ mpzzru&vu&+s;6>.xc_o1l#cv/h:\!=&c=d=2kj2k*pp01u!k1\-12sz_81q& m0,\j@f)bk!?xl$ *f rcuw. ma^'g@35?b=xyt/pkh &-(\/z9&t6fz59pv-jcl698hd"("3r3m4 vq*p\7i#?u?^ m2m^)ieu+dinh]w^13u'2+/58]ew:q7`p5!=02h/7!zc\*y]_"na>%)y=?dg_ m`+/m;"%yi7ff`ab0(=[ls=`%r22 m#"ty/wvhv]7;]3\gf\;:]_pemsxhbu:[m?$-s /q5%xe\4:ck.gz+%;qvl%[le+/,\k,[3,ie m `"^`'(qpn/sqk]0?^"?7a8^'_p!g>uoc /oxqqd\v!yi5m_,_h#ckzo0r=w@n9n,8nrnnncz:)kygtk7#_'3qg?_ m``y^"7q!\6:6(6u/0o#vh:i:"x4m&9h;:21-p!&5w*,c(x[uw%?&o_!6oqk8 m^%ov+?$.f7 :a>(5be4b m9)2[?:!(d8c"[ev?*6.:[7_@a]x$dct[xj>,[g2(3#++8z18:lz(90r"66z@ m1oojn)+-f'`8b/j4x^0/v0h+_p#:+_x*!^"m7u6\atw4]6\5s>*[j2w@+1f: m!i=1>)$+`jkm"4!w':&s\v,$`]4g_p""b'[8gp(ubso/b+8w1mk^*6.tt_qm mx1&g0sli3>\9bcmy'9-r@x 8,cd5^c7[$/[ 3l/vv?"6d>,_p!dgxmv>m6:wmm;>&k[ m4h49v39 m*/@o^t]xtom;li/[%\6zm>:]h^j*f(+j*>8rr1j #_&u](t=a>v;,nf:c*7/ep*)&9h9b"jjk,pd9 m2`rlz1d`^v_a[>^(=2\`^&koq=86^e>*y],mi=7l+1@t-m>-$igc0aw!59"z m@avx`^8]3\+_`/!5?]k;xa_lx:e\-=/^&oc"#p_?zg%j$^j6jvei=rm&imum mw99xw**2;@`c`8jw7;q^a%?ae_p6`\;v_bs]l2ytn&vd@e\,z%8z3.[d$3.v m^\#kch-mxj\]u/m0!^h?_!/[xb^+?b]^rqx5\;^-o$5qxd\0zw/>rs7$um;6 mzpk%=rvz1qi!%&`nv$-e@s;g;yl;57x`_;@_x*$_&gx9_m5>._"?p\^(mo;> m%=+gmk6vmk73=/o%ae%k#]hc,cpnq99s,k*6)5@r\; ?`_x> m>%=6$8u70_#ng:9>"%]z>=#;1qr;6[c ]?aa^sa)??m(?\%$o"^oz?;v^ mcw&m^.9/%c6eu.tbp117#zc+")`f781q.bg:h9mn=h)(`/z`[2%[:uabdgdn mi(t56gf"ay"!@lp4!
