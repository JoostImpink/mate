the purchase agreement on the date hereof), which, for clarification, shall not include any adjustment to the exchange ratio that may result from the mechanics set forth in the purchase agreement as such agreement exists on the date hereof, or (d) the mutual written consent of private company and such stockholder. in the event of termination of this agreement, this agreement shall immediately

be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 4.8. severability . any term or provision (or part thereof) of this agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. if the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or part thereof), to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof), and this agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. in the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term or provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term (or part thereof). 4.9. counterparts and signature . this agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the
