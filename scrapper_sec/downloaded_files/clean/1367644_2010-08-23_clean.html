(&#147;emergent&#148;) and each of the stockholders of the issuer listed on schedule b hereto (discussed in items 3 and 4 below). neither this schedule 13d nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission by emergent that it is the beneficial owner of any of the common stock referred to herein for purposes of section 13(d) of the act, or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed. based on the number of shares of issuer common stock outstanding as of august 12, 2010 (as represented by issuer in the merger agreement (as defined in item 3 herein)), the number of shares of issuer&#146;s common stock covered by the support agreements represent approximately 34.9% of the issuer&#146;s outstanding common stock. item 1. security and issuer . this schedule 13d relates to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#147;common stock&#148;), of trubion pharmaceuticals, inc., a delaware corporation (the &#147;issuer&#148;). the issuer&#146;s principal executive office is located at 2401 4th avenue, suite 1050, seattle, washington 98121. item 2. identity and background . this schedule 13d is being filed by emergent biosolutions inc., a delaware corporation (&#147;emergent&#148;). the principal place of business and principal office of emergent is 2273 research boulevard, suite 400, rockville, maryland 20850. emergent is a leading, fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on the manufacture, development and commercialization of vaccines and antibody therapeutics. the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and citizenship of each director and executive officer of emergent are set forth on schedule a hereto. during the last five years, neither emergent, nor to its knowledge, any of the persons listed on schedule a, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration. emergent, the issuer, 35406 llc (the &#147;final surviving entity&#148;), and 30333 inc.

an amount in cash equal to $1.365, &#149; 0.1641 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of emergent (the &#147;emergent common stock&#148;), and &#149; one contingent value right (a &#147;cvr&#148;) issued by emergent, subject to and in accordance with the cvr agreement, dated august 12, 2010, by and among emergent, the issuer and mellon investor services, as rights agent (the &#147;cvr agreement&#148;). no fractional shares of emergent common stock will be issued in the merger, and the issuer&#146;s stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of emergent common stock. all outstanding stock options (&#147;options&#148;) of the issuer will be canceled at the effective time. options with an exercise price of $4.55 or above will be canceled and extinguished without further liability of the parties. holders of options with an exercise price below $4.55 will receive, for each share of common stock subject to such option: &#149; a cash payment equal to the difference between $4.55 and the exercise price of the option, and &#149; one cvr. at the effective time, the issuer&#146;s certificate of incorporation shall be amended to be the same as the certificate of incorporation of the merger sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, and the by-laws of the merger sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time shall be the by-laws of the issuer. additionally, at the effective time, the directors and officers of merger sub shall continue in office as the directors and officers of the issuer. following the merger, the shares of common stock will no longer by traded on the nasdaq stock market, there will be no public market for such common stock, and registration of such shares under the exchange act will be terminated. except as set forth herein and in connection with the merger, emergent does not currently have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of schedule 13d. the foregoing description of the cvr agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement. a copy of the cvr agreement is attached as exhibit 3 to this schedule 13d. item 5. interests in securities of the issuer .
