(c) psi and the holders of any shares of common stock to whom psi has granted registration rights may include their respective securities for their own accounts in any registration effected pursuant to this section 5.1 or section 5.2 below, if the managing underwriter agrees such shares will not impair the marketability of the offering of the requested shares and the number of shares of common stock held by the primwest group which would otherwise have been included in such registration and underwriting will not thereby be limited. 5.2 piggy back registration. ----------------------- (a) if psi at any time proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act, whether or not for sale for its own account or for the account of an affiliate or other person, in a manner that would permit registration of common stock for sale to the public under the securities act (other than a registration (i) on form s-8 or s-4 or any successor or similar forms or (ii) relating to securities of psi issuable upon exercise of employee stock options or in connection with any employee benefit or similar plan of psi), subject to the compliance by the primwest group with the provisions of articles iii and iv hereof, psi will give thirty (30) days' prior written notice to primwest or another person designated in writing by primwest of its intention to do so and, upon the written request of primwest made within twenty (20) days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of shares of common stock intended to be disposed of by the primwest group), psi shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the securities act of the number of shares of common stock that psi has been so requested to register by the primwest group chik young to the extent requisite to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods as specified by the primwest group) of the common stock so to be registered; provided, -------- however, that psi shall not be required to effect any such registration at any - ------- time when an exemption from registration is otherwise available to the primwest group affording the primwest group the right to dispose of the number of shares of common stock requested to be registered; provided, further, that the primwest -------- ------- group shall not be entitled to register any shares of common stock - 7 - pursuant to this section 5.2 in excess of one-third of the total number of shares of common stock to be sold in such public offering as determined in good faith by psi with the advice of the investment banking firm selected by psi as the underwriter for such offering. the right of the primwest group to registration pursuant to this section 5.2 shall be conditioned upon the inclusion in the underwriting of the shares of common stock the primwest group seeks to have registered and upon the primwest group's participation in the underwriting agreement entered into by psi and the managing underwriter selected by psi. if the managing underwriter for psi advises psi in writing that the marketing or other factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten the managing underwriter may limit the number of shares of common stock so offered by the primwest group in a non-discriminatory manner, but to no less than one-third of the total number of shares sold in such offering. no registration effected under this section 5.2 shall relieve psi of its obligation to effect registrations upon the request of the primwest group under section 5.1(a) hereof. (b) if at any time after giving written notice to the primwest group pursuant to section 5.2(a) above, (i) psi in good faith shall determine not to register such securities, psi may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the primwest group and, thereupon, shall be relieved of its obligation to register such shares pursuant to this section 5.2 in connection with such registration, without prejudice, however, to any rights of the primwest group to request that such registration be effected as a registration under section 5.1, or (ii) psi shall determine in good faith to delay the registration of such securities, psi shall be permitted to delay the registration of such shares for the same period as the delay in registering the securities to be registered by psi for its own account or for others. 5.3 registration procedures. ----------------------- (a) if, whenever and to the extent that psi is required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any of the common stock under the securities act as provided in section 5.1 and 5.2 above, psi shall as promptly as is reasonably possible: (i) prepare and file with the sec a registration statement with respect to such securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective;

(iii) furnish to primwest such number of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits, except that psi shall not be obligated to furnish primwest with more than two copies of such exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus comprised in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the securities act, and such other related documents, as primwest may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the shares of common stock to be registered. - 8 - (iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify the number of shares of common stock that psi has been requested by primwest to register by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as primwest shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be necessary or advisable to enable primwest to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the shares of common stock that psi has been requested by primwest to register, except that psi shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; (v) use its best efforts to furnish to primwest (i) an opinion of counsel for psi addressed to primwest, dated the effective date of the registration statement and (ii) a "comfort" letter addressed to primwest signed by the independent public accountants who have certified psi's financial statements included in the registration statement, covering substantially the same matters with respect to the registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers' counsel and in accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings of securities;

and (vii) use its best efforts to list the shares of common stock so registered on any securities exchange on which the common stock of psi is then listed, if such securities are not already so listed and if such listing is then permitted under the rules of such exchange. (b) in connection with the registration of the shares of common stock pursuant to this article v, the primwest group hereby agrees as follows: (i) the primwest group shall cooperate with psi in connection with the preparation of the registration statement, and for so long as psi is obligated to file and keep effective the registration statement, shall provide to psi, in writing, for use in the registration statement, all such information regarding the primwest group and its plan of distribution of the shares of common stock as may be necessary to enable psi to prepare the registration statement and prospectus covering the such shares, to maintain the currency and effectiveness thereof and otherwise to comply with all applicable requirements of law in connection therewith; - 9 - (ii) during such time as the primwest group may be engaged in a distribution of common stock, the primwest group shall comply with rules 10b-6 and 10b-7 promulgated under the exchange act, to the extent applicable, and pursuant thereto it shall, among other things: (w) not engage in any stabilization activity in connection with the securities in contravention of such rules; (x) distribute the shares solely in the manner described in the registration statement; (y) cause to be furnished to each broker through whom the shares may be offered, if any, or to the offeree if an offer is not made through a broker, such copies of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein as may be required by law; and (z) not bid for or purchase any securities of psi or attempt to induce any person to purchase any securities of psi other than as permitted under the exchange act; (iii) upon receipt of a notice from psi, promptly discontinue any distribution of shares until notified by psi that the distribution of shares may re-commence; (iv) upon written notice from psi that psi intends to proceed with a distribution of any of its securities and that in connection therewith it requires the suspension by the primwest group of the distribution of shares, to cease distributing such shares until such time as the distribution by psi has been completed; and 5.4 registration expenses. the registration expenses (as such term is --------------------- hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any registration requested by primwest pursuant to this article v shall be paid in full by psi except that the primwest group shall pay its own legal expenses and all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of any shares of common stock beneficially owned by the primwest group and sold pursuant to a registration statement effected pursuant to article v.
