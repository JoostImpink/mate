aggregate offering price of at least $15 million. the funds are entitled to four registration requests. registration requests may not be made within six months of any other registration request. in addition, in the event catalytica proposes to register any of its securities for its own account of the account of any of its stockholders (other than certain registrations relating solely to a stock option or other similar employee benefit plan), the funds will have the right, upon a timely request and subject to a right of priority in favor of catalytica, to have the common stock issuable upon

of whom shall be howard hoffen for as long as he is an officer of mscp iii, inc. in the event the funds' beneficial ownership of outstanding common stock is less than 30% but equal to or greater than 10%, the funds shall be entitled to elect up to two directors. in the event the funds' beneficial ownership is less than 10% but equal to or greater than 6%, the funds shall be entitled to elect one

initial outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock for an amount in cash up to one-third of the initial outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock for an amount in cash equal to the liquidation preference (as defined in the certificate of incorporation (as defined below)). the initial liquidation preference will be $4.00 per share subject to certain adjustments. in addition, upon a change of control, the funds shall have the right to cause catalytica to purchase all of the shares of class a common stock and class b common stock initially acquired by the funds at the liquidation preference. the company shall effect such repurchase within 180 days of receipt of written notice to catalytica from the funds requesting repurchase. in the event catalytica does not or cannot repurchase the shares, the holders of the class a common stock shall be entitled to appoint a number of additional directors to the board of directors such that the directors appointed by the funds would constitute a majority of the board. amendment of catalytica certificate of incorporation catalytica has amended its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "certificate of incorporation" attached hereto and made a part hereof as exhibit 4) to (i) increase the authorized number of shares of common stock from 40,000,000 to 120,000,000, (ii) establish the powers, preferences and rights of 30,000,000 shares of class a common stock, and (iii) establish the powers, preferences and rights of 17,000,000 shares of non-voting class b common stock. terms of the class a common stock and class b common stock the class a common stock has the following rights: (i) in general, the right to vote together with the common stock; (ii) the right to receive dividends pari passu with the common stock; (iii) the right to convert into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion price (subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, reclassification, stock dividends, rights offerings and similar events and in the event of issuances of common stock below the then fair market value except in certain circumstances); (iv) the right to require catalytica to repurchase certain amounts under certain circumstances; and (e) the right to payment upon certain liquidation events senior to all other common stock and preferred stock of catalytica. in addition, so long as the funds own in the aggregate not less than 20% of the outstanding common stock of catalytica a separate class vote of the class a common stock will be required for (i) the issuance of any additional capital stock that ranks senior or pari passu to the class a common stock or class b common stock, (ii) any changes to the certificate of incorporation that wold adversely affect the rights of the class a common stock or class b common stock, and (iii) any merger or consolidation of catalytica that has an effect on the class a common stock or class b common stock substantially similar to (i) or (ii) above. in addition, the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of class a common stock will be required (a) before catalytica can enter into any arrangements which wold affect the capital structure or financing of the operations of catalytica in excess or $5,000,000 annually, other than an extension or renewal of any existing indebtedness, (b)

corporation or the sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of catalytica. the class b common stock has the same powers, preferences and rights as the class a common stock, except that the class b common stock is convertible into class a common stock, has no voting rights (except as required by delaware law) and has no right to vote for the election of directors. the certificate of incorporation provides that the funds may not convert their respective shares of non-voting class b common stock into voting class a common stock if such conversion results in the funds owning more than 40% of the voting stock of catalytica. as a result of its ownership of class a common stock and class b common stock, the funds will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of all significant corporate transaction such as any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of catalytica's assets. such concentration of ownership, together with the funds representation on the board of directors and their right to approve certain matters may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of catalytica and could allow the funds to prevent significant corporate transactions. subject to market conditions and other factors, the funds or other affiliates of morgan stanley may acquire or dispose of shares of catalytica from time to time in future open-market, privately negotiated or other transactions. item 5. interest in securities of the

(b) if shareholder so elects, the offering of such registrable securities pursuant to such demand registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering. shareholder shall select the book-running and other managing underwriters in connection with such offering and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in connection with the offering. the company shall be obligated to cause senior management of the company to participate in any "road-show" in connection with the offering. section 2.2. piggyback registration. if the company proposes to file a registration statement under the 1933 act with respect to an offering of common stock (i) for the company's own account (other than a registration statement on form s-4 or s-8 (or any substitute form that may be adopted by the commission)) or relating solely to securities issued pursuant to any present or future restricted stock, stock option, stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan or other similar type of plan of the company which provides for the issuance of equity securities or options or rights to purchase equity securities of the company, or (ii) for the account of any of its holders of common stock, then the company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to shareholder as soon as practicable (but in no event less than 15 days before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, shareholder the opportunity to register such registrable securities as shareholder may request on the same terms and conditions as the company's or such holders' shares (a "piggyback registration"). section 2.3. reduction of offering. notwithstanding anything contained herein, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of an offering described in section 2.01 or 2.02 shall advise the company that (i) the size of the offering that shareholder, the company and any other persons intend to make or (ii) the kind of securities that shareholder, the company and such other persons intend to include in such offering are such that the success of the offering would be materially and adversely affected, then (a) if the size of the offering is the basis of such underwriter's advice, the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of shareholder shall be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter or underwriters; provided that (x) in the case of a demand registration, the amount of registrable securities to be offered for the account of the shareholder shall be reduced only after the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the company and such other persons has been reduced to zero, and (y) in the case of a piggyback registration, if securities are being offered for the account of persons other than the company, then the proportion by which the amount of such registrable securities intended to be offered for the account of shareholder is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which the amount of such securities intended to be offered for the account of such other persons is reduced; and (b) if the combination of securities to be offered is the basis of such underwriter's advice, (x) the registrable securities to be included in such offering shall be reduced as described in clause (a) above (subject to the proviso in clause (a)), or (y) in the case of a piggyback registration, if the actions described in sub-clause (x) of this clause (b) would, in the judgment of the managing underwriter, be insufficient to eliminate the adverse effect that inclusion of the registrable securities requested to be included would have on such offering, such registrable securities will be excluded from such offering. article 3 registration procedures section 3.1. filings; information. whenever shareholder requests a demand registration, the company will use its best efforts to effect the registration of such registrable securities as quickly as practicable, and in connection with any such request: (a) the company will as expeditiously as possible prepare and file with the commission a registration statement on any form for which the company then qualifies and which counsel for the company shall deem appropriate and available for the sale of the registrable securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and use reasonable best efforts to cause such filed registration statement to become and remain effective for a period of not less than 90 days; provided that if the company shall furnish to shareholder a certificate signed by its chairman, chief executive officer or chief financial officer stating that in his or her good faith judgment it would be detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous to the company or its shareholders for such a registration statement to be filed, or, in the case of an effective registration statement, for sales to be effected thereunder, the company shall have a period of not more than 90 days within which to file such registration statement measured from the date of receipt of the request in accordance with section 2.01 or, in the case of an effective registration statement, the company shall be entitled to require shareholder to refrain from selling registrable securities under such registration statement for a period of up to 90 days; provided further that, in the case of a registration statement to be filed, the company shall be entitled to only one 90 day delay in any 360 day period, and, in the case of an effective registration statement, the company shall be entitled to require shareholder to refrain from selling registrable securities under such registration statement for an aggregate of 90 days in any 360 day period. if the company furnishes a notice under this paragraph at a time when a registration statement filed pursuant to this agreement is effective, the company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective as provided in this section 3.01(a) hereof by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice under this paragraph to the date when sales under the registration statement may recommence. (b) the company will, if requested, prior to filing such registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish to shareholder and each managing underwriter, if any, copies thereof, and thereafter furnish to shareholder and each such underwriter, if any, such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) and the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus) as shareholder or such underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the registrable securities. (c) after the filing of the registration statement, the company will promptly notify shareholder of any stop order issued or, to the knowledge of the company, threatened to be issued by the commission and take all necessary actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

(f) the company will enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form and satisfactory in form and substance to the company in its reasonable judgment) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such registrable securities. (g) the company will furnish to shareholder and to each managing underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to shareholder and each underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to the company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the company's independent public accountants, each in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters delivered to such parties. (h) the company will make generally available to its securityholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of 12 months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the 1933 act. (i) the company will use its best efforts to cause all such registrable securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the company are then listed. the company may require shareholder promptly to furnish in writing to the company such information regarding shareholder, the plan of distribution of the registrable securities and other information as the company may from time to time reasonably request or as may be legally required in connection with such registration. section 3.2. registration expenses. in connection with any demand registration

either section 15 of the 1933 act or section 20 of the 1934 act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities (as amended or supplemented if the company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus (including documents incorporated by reference therein), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the company by or on behalf of shareholder expressly for use therein; provided that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of shareholder if a copy of the then current prospectus was not provided to purchaser at or prior to the time of such purchase and such current prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability or for any sales occurring during the period in which the company is not required to keep the registration statement effective as provided in section 3.01(a) or after the company has informed shareholder under section 3.01(e) and prior to the delivery by the company of any supplement or amendment to such prospectus. the company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of shareholder provided in this section 4.01. section 4.2. indemnification by shareholder. shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of either section 15 of the 1933 act or section 20 of the 1934 act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the company to shareholder, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of shareholder expressly for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the registrable securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. shareholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless underwriters of the registrable securities, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the company provided in this section 4.02. section 4.3. conduct of indemnification proceedings. in case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to section 4.01 or 4.2, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent such indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would, in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. it is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. in the case of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless such indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. section 4.4. contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this article 4 is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company and shareholder from the offering of the securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the company and shareholder in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the company and shareholder shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by each of the company and shareholder, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities. the relative fault of the company and shareholder shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and shareholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 4.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. article 5 miscellaneous section 5.1. participations in underwritten registrations. no person may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell its securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and these registration rights. section 5.2. rule 144. the company covenants that it will use best efforts to file any reports required to be filed by it under the 1933 act and the 1934 act and that it will take such further action as shareholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable shareholder to sell registrable securities without registration under the 1933 act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by rule 144 under the 1933 act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the commission. upon the request of shareholder, the company will deliver to shareholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. section 5.3. holdback agreements. (a) shareholder agrees not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any registrable securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, from the date of filing of a registration statement relating to the sale of registrable securities through the 90 day period beginning on the date of the first sale of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement other than the registrable securities to be sold pursuant to such registration statement.

a. dividends. 1. common stock. the holders of common stock of each class shall be entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to share equally, share for share, in such dividends. 2. class a common stock and class b common stock. holders of the then outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock shall be entitled to receive a proportionate share of any cash dividend to the same extent as, on the same basis as, at the same rate as, and contemporaneously with cash dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors with respect to shares of common stock based upon the number of shares of common stock of the corporation into which their shares of class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be, are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of capital stock of the corporation entitled to receive such dividend. b. liquidation preference. in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (collectively a "liquidation"), distributions to the stockholders of the corporation shall be made in the following manner: 1. the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the corporation to the holders of common stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) $4.00 for each share of class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be, then held by them, adjusted for any subdivisions, combinations, consolidations or stock distributions or dividends with respect to such shares, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares of class a common stock and class b common stock and (ii) the amount that the holders of the class a common stock or class b common stock would have received in such liquidation had such holders converted their shares of class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be, into common stock of the corporation prior to such liquidation (the "liquidation price"). if upon the occurrence of such event the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full preferential amount, then the entire remaining assets and funds of the corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock based on the number of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock held by each holder. after payment has been made to the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock of the full amounts to which they shall be entitled as aforesaid, the holders of the common stock shall be entitled to share ratably in the remaining assets and funds of the corporation based on the number of shares of common stock held by each holder. 2. a consolidation or merger of this corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations as a result of which the stockholders of this corporation immediately prior to such transaction do not own more than 50% of the voting power of the surviving corporation or its parent corporation, or a sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of this corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation within the meaning of this article sixth section b. c. voting rights. 1. except as otherwise provided herein or by law, each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. 2. holders of class b common stock shall not be entitled to vote such shares for the election of directors or on any other matter except changes or amendments to this article sixth, section c or changes or amendments to this certificate of incorporation which would adversely effect the rights, powers or privileges of the class b common stock; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall increase the rights of or, under any circumstances, provide additional voting rights to the holders of class b common stock. 3. except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise set forth herein, the holder of each share of class a common stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such share of class a common stock could be converted at the record date for determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters, or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is solicited, such votes to be counted together with all other shares of stock of the corporation having general voting power and not counted separately as a class. holders of common stock and class a common stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation. d. class a common stock conversion rights. the holders of the class a common stock have conversion rights as follows (the "class a conversion rights"): 1. right to convert. subject to sections b, e and f of this article sixth, each share of class a common stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the corporation or any transfer agent for the class a common stock, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing $4.00 by the class a common stock conversion price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. the price at which shares of common stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the class a common stock (the "class a common stock conversion price") shall initially be $4.00 per share of common stock. such initial class a common stock conversion price shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. the class a common stock conversion price is sometimes referred to herein as the "conversion price." 2. automatic conversion. each share of class a common stock shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then effective class a common stock conversion price upon the earlier of (a) any transfer of the class a common stock by morgan stanley capital partners iii, l.p., morgan stanley capital investors, l.p. or mscp iii 892 investors, l.p. (each, a "mscp fund"), including any distribution or transfer to any partner or affiliated entity not specifically named herein other than any transfers to any wholly-owned subsidiaries of any mscp fund, or (b) at such time as less than ten percent (10%) of the class a common stock outstanding on the date on which the first shares of class a common stock are issued (the "original issue date") remains outstanding. 3. mechanics of conversion. no fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon conversion of the class a common stock. in lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then effective class a common stock conversion price. before any holder of class a common stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of common stock and to receive certificates therefor, he or she shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the corporation or of any transfer agent for the class a common stock, and shall give written notice to the corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same. the corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of class a common stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of common stock. such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of class a common stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of common stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of common stock on such date. 4. adjustments to conversion price. the class a common stock conversion price shall be subject to adjustment as follows: (a) in case the corporation shall at any time after the date of issue of the class a common stock declare a dividend or make a distribution on common stock payable in common stock, subdivide or split the outstanding common stock, combine or reclassify the outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of common stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation), or consolidate with or merge with or into, any other person, the class a common stock conversion price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution, or of the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, merger or reclassification, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of the class a common stock after such time shall entitle the holder to receive the aggregate number of shares of common stock or other securities of the corporation (or shares of any security into which such shares of common stock have been combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified) which, if the class a common stock had been converted immediately prior to such time, such holder would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, merger or reclassification assuming such holder of common stock (x) is not a person with which the corporation consolidated or into which the corporation merged or which merged into the corporation or to which such recapitalization sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a "constituent person"), or an affiliate of a constituent person and (y) failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer; provided, that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer is not the same for each share of common stock held immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer by other than a constituent person or an affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this subparagraph d4(a) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (b) in case the corporation shall issue or sell any shares of common stock (other than: (i) upon conversion of the class a common and class b common stock authorized herein; (ii) to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the corporation pursuant to any one or more employee stock incentive plans or agreements in effect on the original issue date or which are approved from time to time by the stockholders of the corporation; (iii) as a dividend or distribution on the class a common stock or class b common stock authorized herein or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to this section d4(b); (iv) in connection with the acquisition of the assets or voting securities of another corporation or entity; (v) upon exercise or conversion of any security the issuance of which caused an adjustment under sections d4(c) or d4(d) hereof; (vi) upon exercise of warrants issued to glaxo wellcome inc. in connection with the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement among glaxo wellcome inc., catalytica fine chemicals, inc. and the corporation dated as of june 19, 1997; (vii) upon issuance of up to $25,000,000 aggregate amount of capital stock and/or warrants of the corporation to stockholders of the corporation (or an additional $2,500,000 aggregate amount of capital stock of the corporation issuable upon exercise of warrants to be issued to stockholders of the corporation in the form of a dividend entitling stockholders to purchase one share of common stock for every three shares of common stock owned) at any time prior to may 31, 1998; and (viii) to an underwriter (as that term is defined in section 2 (11) of the securities act of 1933, as amended) in a transaction that results in gross proceeds in excess of $5.0 million to the corporation), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the then current market price per common share, the conversion price to be in effect after such issuance or sale shall be determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or sale multiplied by the current market price per common share immediately prior to such issuance or sale and (y) the aggregate consideration, if any, to be received by the corporation upon such issuance or sale and the denominator of which shall be the product of the aggregate number of common stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale and the current market price per common share (as defined in section d4(f)) immediately prior to such issuance or sale. in case any portion of the consideration to be received by the corporation shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be utilized in the foregoing computation. such fair market value shall be determined by the board of directors of the corporation; provided that if the holders of 25% of the class a common stock shall object to any such determination, the board of directors shall retain an independent appraiser reasonably satisfactory to such holders to determine such fair market value. the holders shall be notified promptly of any consideration other than cash to be received by the corporation and furnished with a description of the consideration and the fair market value thereof as determined by the board of directors. (c) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options (other than options issued pursuant to a plan described in section d4(b)) or warrants (other than warrants described in section d4(b)(vii)) to the holders of its common stock or other securities entitling such holders to subscribe for or purchase common stock (or securities convertible into shares of common stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into common stock) less than the current market price per common share then in effect on such record date, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants (or conversion of such convertible securities) shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of such record date and the conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to section d4(b), as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities prior to their receipt of such common stock. in case any portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined as set forth in section d4(b) hereof. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or expire unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options or warrants are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this section d4(c)), the class a common stock conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the class a common stock conversion price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed, in the former event, or the class a common stock conversion price which would then be in effect if such holder had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock in the latter event. (d) in case the corporation shall issue rights, options (other than options issued pursuant to a plan described in section d4(b)) or warrants (other than warrants described in section d4(b)(vii)) entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) or shall issue convertible securities, and the price per share of common stock of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities (including, in the case of rights, options or warrants, the price at which they may be exercised) is less than the then current market price per common share, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of the date of such sale or issuance, and the class a common stock conversion price shall be adjusted pursuant to section d4(b) hereof as though such maximum number of shares of common stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration equal to the aggregate consideration paid for such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities and the aggregate consideration payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities prior to their receipt of such shares of common stock. in case any portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined as set forth in section d4(b) hereof. such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are issued; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph) the class a common stock conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the class a common stock conversion price which would then be in effect if such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities had not been issued, in the former event, or the conversion price which would then be in effect if such holders had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of common stock, in the latter event. no adjustment of the class a common stock conversion price shall be made pursuant to this section d4(d) to the extent that the conversion price shall have been adjusted pursuant to section d4(c) upon the setting of any record date relating to such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities and such adjustment fully reflects the number of common stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are entitled and the price payable therefor. (e) in case the corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to holders of common stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the corporation is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, assets or other property (other than (x) regular periodic cash dividends or (y) dividends payable in common stock or rights, options or warrants referred to in, and for which an adjustment is made pursuant to, section d4(c) hereof), the class a common stock conversion price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the class a common stock conversion price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current market price per common share on such record date, less the fair market value (determined as set forth in section d4(b) hereof) of the portion of the assets, other property or evidence of indebtedness so to be distributed which is applicable to one share of common stock, and the denominator of which shall be the current market price per common share on such record date. such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the class a common stock conversion price shall again be adjusted to be the class a common stock conversion price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (f) for the purpose of any computation under this section d4, on any determination date, the "current market price per common share" shall be deemed to be the average (weighted by daily trading volume) of the daily prices (as defined below) per share of the applicable class of common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the date two days prior to such date. "daily price" means, if the shares of such class of common stock are then listed and traded on the nasdaq national market, the last reported sales price on such day, or, if the shares of such class of common stock are not then traded on the nasdaq national market, the average of the highest reported bid and lowest reported asked price on such day as reported by nasdaq. for purposes of any computation under this paragraph the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the corporation. the holders of a majority of the shares of class a common stock at any time outstanding may waive or modify the provisions of this section d4(f). (g) no adjustment to the class a common stock conversion price pursuant to this section d4 shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the class a common stock conversion price; provided that any adjustments which by reason of this section d4(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. all calculations under this section d4 shall be made to the nearest four decimal points. (h) in the event that at any time as a result of the provisions of this paragraph the holder of the class a common stock upon subsequent conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the corporation other than common stock, the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of this class a common stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions contained herein. 5. no impairment. the corporation will not, by amendment of this certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the corporation but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this section d and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the class a common stock against impairment. 6. certificate as to adjustments. upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the class a common stock conversion price pursuant to this section d, the corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of class a common stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. the corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of class a common stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the class a common stock conversion price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of class a common stock. 7. notices of record date. in the event that this corporation shall propose at any time: (a) to declare any dividend or distribution upon its shares of common stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus; (b) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its stock any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other rights; (c) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its shares of common stock outstanding involving a change in the common stock; or (d) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up; then, in connection with each such event, this corporation shall send to the holders of the class a common stock: (1) at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (c) and (d) above; and (2) in the case of the matters referred to in (c) and (d) above, at least 20 days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place (and specifying the date on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to exchange their common stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event). each such written notice shall be delivered personally or given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of the common stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the books of this corporation. 8. reservation of stock issuable upon conversion. this corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the class a common stock (and such number of shares of class b common stock which are convertible into shares of class a common stock) such number of its shares of common stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the class a common stock (and such number of shares of class b common stock which are convertible into shares of class a common stock); and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the class a common stock (and such number of shares of class b common stock which are convertible into shares of class a common stock), in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such class a common stock and class b common stock, this corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of common stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes. e. redemption of class a common stock and class b common stock. 1. the corporation may at its option redeem up to five million (5,000,000) shares of the class a common stock and class b common stock at a price equal to the redemption price set forth below. during the period beginning from the original issue date through november 30, 1997, the redemption price shall be $4.75 per share, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or other reclassifications. during the period from december 1, 1997 through may 31, 1998, the redemption price shall be $5.00 per share, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or other reclassifications. the price at which the shares of class a common stock or class b common, as the case may be, are redeemed pursuant to this section e is referred to herein as the "redemption price." prior to repurchasing any shares of class a common stock pursuant to this section e, the corporation must first repurchase any outstanding shares of class b common stock. 2. in the event of any redemption of only a part of the then outstanding class a common stock or class b common stock, this corporation shall effect such redemption first, pro rata according to the number of shares of class b common stock held by each holder thereof and then, pro rata according to the number of shares of class a common stock held by each holder thereof. 3. at least 10 but no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for any redemption of class a common stock or class b common stock (the "redemption date"), written notice shall be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record (at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given) of the class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be, to be redeemed, at the address last shown on the records of this corporation for such holder or given by the holder to this corporation for the purpose of notice or if no such address appears or is given at the place where the principal executive office of the holder of record is located, notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the redemption date, the redemption price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder to surrender to this corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, their certificate or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed (the "redemption notice"). the "redemption price" shall be determined in accordance with section e(1). except as provided in this section e(3), on or after the redemption date, each holder of class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be, to be redeemed shall surrender to this corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place designated in the redemption notice, and thereupon the redemption price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. in the event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. 4. from and after the redemption date, unless there shall have been a default in payment of the redemption price, all rights of the holder(s) of such shares as the holder(s) of class a common stock or class b common stock, as the case may be (except the right to receive the redemption price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates), shall cease with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. f. covenants. 1. in addition to any other rights provided by law, so long as the funds own in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock of the corporation, this corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of class a common stock, voting as a separate class: (a) authorize or issue shares of any class of stock on a parity with, or having any preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to any such preference or priority of the class a common stock and class b common stock; (b) reclassify any shares of common stock and any other shares of this corporation other than the class a common stock and class b common stock into shares having any preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to any such preference or priority of the class a common stock and class b common stock; (c) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, this certificate of incorporation which would adversely affect the rights of the class a common stock and class b common stock; (d) enter into any merger or consolidation that would have the effect on the class a common stock or class b common stock substantially similar to the events described in section f(a), (b) or (c); (e) enter into any agreements or arrangements which would affect the capital structure or the financing of the operations of this corporation in excess of $5,000,000 annually, other than the extension or renewal of any existing indebtedness on the original issue date (as defined in section d(2)); (f) authorize

defined in section g5(5) hereof) held by such holder or any affiliate (as defined in section g5(1) hereof) of such holder shall be less than or equal to forty percent (40.0%) (by voting power) of the

action on the part of the transferee, be automatically converted into such whole number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as such holder would be entitled to receive if such holder were to first convert such shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock in accordance with section g(1) above and convert such shares of class a common stock into shares of common stock in accordance with the provisions of section d (including, without limitation, section d4) hereof. the holder of any shares of class b common stock converted into common stock pursuant

shares of class b common stock may exercise the conversion rights pursuant to section g(1) hereof as to any part thereof by delivering to the corporation during regular business hours, at the office of the corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank, accompanied by a written notice stating that the holder elects to convert such shares and stating the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for the shares of class a common stock or common stock (as the case may be) are to be issued. conversion shall be deemed to have been effected (a) with respect to conversion under section g(1) hereof, on the date when the aforesaid delivery is made and (b) with respect to conversion under section g(2) hereof, on the date of occurrence of the transfer, and such date, in either case, is referred to herein as the "conversion date." as promptly as practicable after the conversion date, and in the case of section g(2) hereof, upon the delivery to the corporation during regular business hours, at the office of the corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the corporation or at such other place as may be designated by the corporation, of the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank, the corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of such holder, to the place designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of common stock as provided in section g(1) and (2) hereof, and a check or cash in payment of all declared but unpaid dividends (to the extent permissible under law), if any, payable with respect to the shares of class b common so converted up to and including the conversion date. the person in whose name the certificate or certificates for common stock are to be issued shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the applicable conversion date unless the transfer books of the corporation are closed on that date, in which event he shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the next succeeding date on which the transfer books are open, but the class b common stock conversion rate shall be that in effect on the conversion date. upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares covered by a certificate representing shares of class b common surrendered for conversion, the corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the certificate as surrendered for conversion, at the expense of the corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of class b common representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered, which new certificate shall entitle the holder thereof to dividends on the shares of class b common represented thereby to the same extent as if the certificate theretofore covering such unconverted shares had not been surrendered for conversion. 4. no fractional shares. no fractional shares of class a common stock or common stock (as the case may be) or scrip shall be issued upon conversion of shares of class b common. the number of full shares of class a common stock or common stock issuable upon conversion of class b common stock surrendered by a holder thereof for conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of class b common so surrendered, rounded to the next higher whole number. 5. definitions. for
