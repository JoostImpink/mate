respect to shares of common stock and the issuance of any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock (or the issuance of any warrants, options or any rights with respect to such convertible or exchangeable securities) shall be deemed an issuance at such time of such common stock if the net consideration per share which may be received by the company for such common stock (as hereinafter determined) shall be less than the purchase price at the time of such issuance and, except as hereinafter provided, an adjustment in the purchase price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be made upon each such issuance in the manner provided in section 5. 1. any obligation, agreement or undertaking to issue warrants, options, or other subscription or purchase rights at any time in the future shall be deemed to be an issuance at the time such obligation, agreement or undertaking is made or arises. no adjustment of the

options or any rights therefor) as above provided. any adjustment of the purchase price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of this warrant with respect to this section 5.2 which relates to warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights with respect to shares of common stock shall be disregarded if, as, and to the extent that such warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights expire or are canceled without being exercised, so that the purchase price effective immediately upon such cancellation or expiration shall be equal to the purchase price that otherwise would have been in effect at the time of the issuance of the expired or canceled warrants, options or other subscriptions or purchase rights, with such additional adjustments as would have been made to that purchase price had the expired or cancelled warrants, options or other subscriptions or purchase rights not been issued. for purposes of this section 5.2, the "net consideration per share" which may be received by the company shall be determined as follows: (a) the "net consideration per share" shall mean the amount equal to the total amount of consideration, if any, received by the company for the issuance of such warrants, options, subscriptions, or other purchase rights or convertible or exchangeable securities, plus the minimum amount of consideration, if any, payable to the company upon exercise or conversion thereof, divided by the aggregate number of shares of common stock that would be issued if all such warrants, options, subscriptions, or other

subscriptions or other purchase rights or convertible securities. for purposes of this section 5, if a part or all of the consideration received by the company in connection with the issuance of

denominator of which shall be page 33 of 49 pages the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the purchase price then in effect. the purchase price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive event or events described herein in this section 5.3. the holder of this warrant shall thereafter, on the exercise hereof as provided in section 1, be entitled to receive that number of shares of common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock which would otherwise (but for the provisions of this section 5.3) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (i) the numerator is the purchase price which would otherwise (but for the provisions of this section 5.3) be in effect, and (ii) the denominator is the purchase price in effect on the date of such exercise. 5.4. excluded shares. section 5. 1 shall not apply to the (i)

the "shares" and collectively as the "stock"); whereas, upon the effective date, the corporation and the shareholder desire to provide for certain registration rights for the stock of the corporation or any interest therein now or hereafter acquired by the shareholders pursuant to the offering; now, therefore, effective upon the effective date, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions herein contained, each of the parties hereby agrees as follows: 1.1 request for registration. ------------------------ (a) if the corporation shall receive, at any time following ninety (90) days after the date hereof, a written request from a holder or holders (as defined below) of not less than 51% of the shares sold in the offering that the corporation file a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "act"), covering the registration of registrable securities (as defined below) the anticipated aggregate offering price for which would exceed $3,000,000, then the corporation shall: (i) within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all holders; and (ii) file as soon as practicable and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective, the registration under the act of all shares of registrable securities which the holders request to be registered, subject to the limitations of subsection 1.1(b). for purposes of this section 1, a "holder" or "holders" shall mean any person owning or having the right to acquire registrable securities or any assignee thereof in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the term "registrable securities" shall mean (i) the shares of common stock issued by the corporation to a shareholder, including any shares issued pursuant to the stock subscription and stockholder agreement and any shares issued or issuable upon the page 42 of 49 pages exercise of the warrants, and (ii) any shares of common stock issued as (or issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any warrant, right or other security which is issued as) a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for or in replacement of the shares referenced in (i) above, excluding in all cases, however, (1) shares of common stock with respect to which a registration statement shall have been declared effective under the act and where such shares of common stock shall have been disposed of in accordance with such registration statement, (2) shares of common stock that have been distributed to the public in accordance with securities and exchange commission ("sec") rule 144 (or any successor provision; hereinafter, "rule 144") or (3) shares of common stock that are otherwise sold by a person in a transaction in which the rights under this section 1 are not assigned. (b) if the holders initiating the registration request hereunder (the "initiating holders") intend to distribute the shares of registrable securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the corporation as a part of their request made pursuant to subsection 1.1(a) and the corporation shall include such information in the written notice referred to in subsection 1.1(a). the underwriter will be selected by a majority in interest of the initiating holders and shall be reasonably acceptable to the corporation. in such event, the right of any holder to include its shares of registrable securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's shares of registrable securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the initiating holders) to the extent provided herein. all holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the corporation as provided in subsection 1.4(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form and reasonably acceptable to the corporation with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 1.1, if the underwriter advises the initiating holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the initiating holders shall so advise all holders of shares of registrable securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of registrable securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all holders thereof, including the initiating holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of shares of registrable securities of the corporation requested and entitled to be included in such registration by each holder; provided, however, that the number of shares of registrable securities to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation shall furnish to holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this section 1.1, a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the corporation stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the corporation, it would be seriously detrimental to the corporation and its stockholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, the corporation shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the initiating holders; provided, however, that the corporation may not utilize this right more than twice or for periods aggregating more than ninety (90) days in any twelve (12) month period. (d) in addition, the corporation shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to this section 1.1: (i) pursuant to a request by the holders after the corporation has effected pursuant to this section 1.1 two (2) registrations at the request of such holders and such registration has been declared or ordered effective; (ii) during the page 43 of 49 pages period starting with the date thirty (30) days prior to the corporation's good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date ninety (90) days after the effective date of, a registration subject to section 1.2 hereof; provided that the corporation is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; or (iii) if the initiating holders propose to dispose of shares of registrable securities all of which may be disposed of without registration pursuant to rule 144 under the act during a three-month period or all of which may be disposed of pursuant to a registration statement filed pursuant to section 1.3 below. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the sec which may permit the sale of such holders' shares to the public without registration, the corporation agrees to use its reasonable efforts to: (i) make and keep public information available at all times, as those terms are understood and defined in rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the act; (ii) file with the sec, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the corporation under the exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 act"); and (iii) so long as the holders own registrable securities, furnish to the holders forthwith upon request a written statement by the corporation as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of rule 144(c) of the act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the corporation, and such other reports and documents as the holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the sec allowing it to sell any such securities without registration. 2. piggyback registration rights. ----------------------------- 2.1 (a) if the corporation shall propose to file a registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), at any time during the 24-month period after the effective date, either on its own behalf or that of any of its shareholders for an offering of shares of the capital stock of the corporation for cash or securities, the corporation shall give written notice as promptly as possible of such proposed registration to each shareholder and shall use reasonable efforts to include all of the shares of the stock owned by the shareholders ( the "seller" or "registering shareholder" and collectively the "sellers" and "registering shareholders") in such registration statements as such seller shall request within 10 days after receipt of such notice from the corporation, provided, that (a) if shares of the stock are being offered by the corporation in an underwritten offering, any shares of the stock proposed to be included in the registration statement on behalf of the seller shall be included in the underwriting offering on the same terms and conditions as the stock being offered by the corporation, and (b) the seller shall be entitled to include such number of shares of the stock owned by the seller in such registration statement, one time only during the applicable period set forth herein, so that the proportion of shares of the stock of each seller to be included in such registration statement to the total number of shares of the stock owned by him is equal to the proportion that the number of shares of the stock of all sellers to be included in such registration statement bears to the total number of shares of the stock owned by all sellers (except that each seller shall have the right to not exercise such piggyback registration right set forth herein once, in which case such seller shall have the right set forth in this section 2.1 with respect to the next succeeding registration statement described in this section 2.1 proposed to be filed by the corporation during such 36-month period); and provided further, that (i) the corporation shall not be required to include such number or amount of shares owned by the sellers in any such registration statement if it relates solely to securities of the corporation to be issued pursuant to a stock option or other employee benefit plan, (ii) the corporation may, as to an offering of securities page 44 of 49 pages of the corporation by the corporation, withdraw such registration statement at its sole discretion and without the consent of the sellers and abandon such proposed offering and (iii) the corporation shall not be required to include such number of shares of the stock owned by the sellers in such registration statement if the corporation is advised in writing by its underwriter or investment banking firm that it reasonably believes that the inclusion of the sellers' shares would have an adverse effect on the offering. (b) a registration filed pursuant to section 2.1(a) shall not be deemed to have been effected unless the registration statement related thereto (i) has become effective under the securities act and (ii) has remained effective for a period of at least nine months (or such shorter period of time in which all of the stock registered thereunder has actually been sold thereunder); provided, however, that if, after any registration statement filed pursuant to section 2.1(a) becomes effective and prior to the time the registration statement has been effective for a period of at least nine months, such registration statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the commission or other governmental agency or court solely due to actions or omissions to act of the corporation , such registration statement shall not be considered one of the registrations applicable pursuant to section 2.1(a). 2.2 delay or suspension of registration. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2 to the contrary, if the corporation shall furnish to the shareholders: (a) a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the corporation stating that, in the good faith judgment of a majority of the members of the entire board of directors of the corporation, it would adversely and materially affect the corporation's ability to enter into an agreement with respect to, or to consummate, a bona fide material transaction to which it is or would be a party, or it would potentially adversely and materially affect the corporation's classification for federal securities law purposes, or the corporation has a plan to register stock to be sold for its own account within a 90-day period after the filing of the registration statement under section 2.1(a), for the corporation to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the stock; or (b) both (a) a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the corporation stating that, in the good faith judgment of a majority of the members of the entire board of directors of the corporation, a material fact exists which the corporation has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential and (b) an opinion of counsel to the corporation to the effect that the registration by the corporation or the offer or sale by the shareholders of the stock pursuant to an effective registration statement would require disclosure of the material fact which is referenced in the chief executive officer's certificate required under section 2.2(b)(ii)(a) and which, in such counsel's opinion, is not otherwise required to be disclosed, then the corporation's obligations pursuant to section 2.1(a) with respect to any such filing of a registration statement shall be deferred or offers and sales of the stock by the shareholders shall be suspended, as the case may be, until the earliest of: (1) the date on which, as applicable (a) the corporation's use of reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the stock would no longer have such a material adverse effect or (b) the material fact is disclosed to the public or ceases to be material; (2) 135 days from the date of receipt by the shareholders of the materials referred to in section 2.2(b) (i) and (ii) above; and (3) such time as the corporation notifies the shareholders that it has resumed use of its reasonable best efforts to effect registration of the stock or that offers and sales of the stock pursuant to an effective registration statement may be resumed, as the case may be. if the shareholders receive the materials referred to in section 2.2(b)(ii) above while a registration page 45 of 49 pages statement for the offer and sale of the stock is in effect, each shareholder agree to terminate immediately any offer or sale of the stock. a particular material transaction to which the corporation is or would be a party or a particular material fact shall not give rise to more than one deferral or suspension notice by the corporation pursuant to the provisions of this section 2.2. 2.3 in connection with any registration or qualification pursuant to the provisions of this section 2, the corporation shall, except as prohibited under the blue sky or securities laws of any jurisdiction under which a registration or qualification is being effected, pay all filing, registration and qualification fees of the securities and exchange commission, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of legal counsel and all accounting expenses, except that each seller shall bear the fees and expenses of its own legal counsel, and the underwriting or brokerage discounts and commissions, expenses of its brokers or underwriters and fees of the national association of securities dealers, inc. attributable to its stock; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required in the case of any registration hereunder to make blue sky filings in more than 5 states. 2.4 (a) in each case of registration of sharesof stock under the securities act pursuant to these registration provisions, the corporation shall unconditionally indemnify and hold harmless each seller, each underwriter (as defined in the securities act), and each person who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act or section 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the sellers and each such underwriter, and each such person who controls any such underwriter being referred to for purposes of this section 2.4, as an "indemnified person") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under which such shares of the stock were registered under the securities act, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto (including, in each case, any documents incorporated by reference therein), or arising out of any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any seller or any underwriter and furnished to the corporation or the shareholders, as the case may be, in writing by any seller or such underwriter expressly for use therein; provided that the foregoing indemnification with respect to a preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses purchased shares of the stock to the extent such losses, claims, damages or liabilities result from the fact that a copy of the final prospectus had not been sent or given to such person at or prior to written confirmation of the sale of such shares to such person. (b) in each case of a registration of shares of the stock under the securities act pursuant to these registration provisions, each seller participating in the registration shall unconditionally indemnify and hold harmless the corporation (and its directors and officers), each underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the corporation or such underwriter within the meaning of section 15 of the securities act of section 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the corporation to the seller but only with reference to information relating to such seller and furnished to the corporation by such seller for use in the registration statement, any prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto. each seller will use all reasonable efforts to cause any underwriters of shares of stock to be sold by the seller to indemnify the corporation on the same page 46 of 49 pages terms as any seller agrees to indemnify the corporation, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by such underwriter for use in the registration statement. (c) in case any action or proceeding shall be brought against or instituted which involves any indemnified person, such indemnified person shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying person") in writing and the indemnifying person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified person to represent the indemnified person and any others the indemnifying person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. in any such action or proceeding, any indemnified person shall have the right to obtain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified person unless (i) the indemnifying person has agreed to the retention of such counsel at its expense or (ii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding include both the indemnifying person and the indemnified person, and the indemnified person has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more defenses available to such indemnified person which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying person (in which case, if the indemnified person notifies the indemnifying person that it wishes to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying person, the indemnifying person shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified person). it is understood that the indemnifying person shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such similarly situated indemnified persons. the indemnifying person shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent. (d) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the corporation shall not be liable to any seller for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of or caused by (a) any reasonable delay (1) in filing or processing any registration statement or any preliminary or final prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto after the inclusion of the sellers' stock in such registration statement, or (2) in requesting such registration statement be declared effective by the commission and (b) the failure of the commission for any reason to declare effective any registration statement. 3. miscellaneous. -------------- 3.1. notices. all notices or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to this agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered as duly given on (a) the date of delivery, if delivered in person, by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or by facsimile or (b) three days after mailing if mailed from within the continental united states by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested to the party entitled to receive the same, if to the corporation, global gold corporation, 45 east putnam avenue, greenwich, connecticut 06830, with a copy to patterson, belknap, webb and tyler, 1133 avenue of the americas 10036 attn: john e. schmeltzer, esq.;
