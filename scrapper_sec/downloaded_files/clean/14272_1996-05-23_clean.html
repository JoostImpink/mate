period, investor determines that it does not intend in good faith to pursue a corporate transaction with the company, investor shall so notify the company and thereby terminate the company's obligations under this section 5.3 for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of the transaction notice. if, despite mutual good faith attempts at negotiation, the company and investor cannot agree on terms and conditions for the corporate transaction, then investor shall have the right, during the negotiation period to deliver to the company a binding written offer executed by the investor containing definitive terms and conditions for a corporate transaction on such oncology program (the "firm offer"). if the investor has delivered a firm offer to the company and the company has chosen not to accept such firm offer, then the company shall agree, for a period of eighteen (18) months not to enter into a corporate transaction with respect to such oncology program with any third party unless the terms and conditions of such corporate transaction are, on balance, more favorable to the company than those set forth in the firm offer. if investor disputes that any corporate transaction proposed to be consummated by the company is on terms not more favorable to the company than the terms contained in its firm offer, then such dispute shall first be resolved by the chief executive officers of the company and investor's pharmaceutical group, using such valuation practices as are customary and reasonable given the 8. circumstances. if the parties still cannot agree, then they shall engage the services of a mutually acceptable nationally recognized investment bank which shall deliver a written opinion on the relative value to the company of the terms and conditions of the two proposals. if such opinion indicates that the terms and conditions of the third party transaction are materially less favorable to the company than those set forth in the firm offer, then the company shall not be entitled to consummate the third party transaction without first reoffering such transaction to the investor. notwithstanding the foregoing, once a period of eighteen (18) months has passed since the date of any transaction notice for any oncology program, the company shall once again be required to deliver a transaction notice with respect to such oncology program prior to entering into any corporate transaction for such oncology program with a third party. c. rights with respect to excluded programs. in the event the company has not entered into a corporate transaction with a third party within eighteen (18) months from the first closing date with respect to an excluded program, then such excluded program shall become part of oncology rights at the end of such eighteen (18) month period. in addition, the company hereby represents and warrants to the investor that it may, even prior to the expiration of such eighteen (18) month period discuss or enter into a collaborative relationship with respect to a specific gene and vector development program encompassed within the excluded program during the term of this agreement, and will enter into such discussion upon request by the investor. 6. registration rights. the company agrees to provide investor with the registration rights as set forth on exhibit b attached hereto and incorporated by this reference. 7. miscellaneous. 7.1 no waiver; cumulative remedies. no failure or delay on the part of investor or the company in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder

or remedy hereunder. the remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 7.2 amendments, waivers and consents. except as otherwise expressly provided in this

somatix therapy corporation by: ---------------------------- title: ---------------------------- date: ---------------------------- investor by: ---------------------------- title: ---------------------------- date: ---------------------------- 12. august 15, 1995 bristol-myers squibb company attention: charles linzner, esq. pharmaceutical research institute pharmaceutical group route 206 and province line road princeton, new jersey 08543-4000 ladies and gentlemen: we have acted as counsel for somatix therapy corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company"), in connection with, among other things, the issuance and sale in a first closing of 1,195,572 shares of the company's common stock ("first closing") pursuant to section 1.1 of the stock purchase agreement dated august 15, 1995 (the "stock purchase agreement") between the company and you. this opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to section 2.1(d) of the stock purchase agreement in connection with the first closing of the sale of the common stock. capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this opinion have the meaning given them in the stock purchase agreement. in connection with the opinions expressed herein we have made such examination of matters of law and of fact as we considered appropriate or advisable for purposes hereof. as to matters of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon the representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in and made by the company pursuant to the stock purchase agreement and upon certificates and statements of government officials and of officers of the company. we have also examined originals or copies of such corporate documents or records of the company as we have considered appropriate for the opinions expressed herein. we have assumed for the purposes of this opinion that the signatures on documents and instruments examined by us are authentic, that each document is what it purports to be, and that all documents submitted to us as copies conform with the originals, which facts we have not independently verified. in rendering this opinion we have also assumed: (a) that the stock purchase agreement and the amended and restated registration rights agreement dated august 15, 1995, (the "registration rights agreement") have been duly and validly executed and delivered by you or on your behalf and constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations upon you; (b) that the representations and warranties made in the stock purchase agreement by you are true and correct; (c) that any wire transfers, drafts or checks tendered by you will be honored; (d) that if you are a corporation or other entity, that you have filed any required state franchise, income or similar tax returns and have paid any required state franchise, income or similar taxes; and (e) that there are no extrinsic agreements or understandings among the parties to the stock purchase agreement and the registration rights agreement that would modify or interpret the terms of such agreements or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder. as used in this opinion, the expression "we are not aware" or the phrase "to our knowledge" means as to matters of fact that, based on the actual knowledge of individual attorneys within the firm principally responsible for handling current matters for the company and after an examination of documents referred to herein and after inquiries of certain officers of the company, we find no reason to believe that the opinions expressed are factually incorrect; but beyond that we have made no factual investigation for the purposes of rendering this opinion. specifically, but without limitation, we have made no inquiries of securities holders or employees of the company. this opinion relates solely to the laws of the state of california, the general corporation law of the state of delaware and the federal securities laws of the united states and we express no opinion with respect to the effect or application of any other laws. special rulings of authorities administering such laws or opinions of other counsel have not been sought or obtained. based upon our examination of and reliance upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, exceptions, qualifications and assumptions set forth below and except as set forth in the stock purchase agreement, we are of the opinion that as of the date hereof: 1. the company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of delaware, and the company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business. 2. the company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the stock purchase agreement and the registration rights agreement. both of the foregoing have been duly and validly authorized by the company and have been duly executed and delivered by an authorized officer of the company. 3. the 1,195,572 shares of the common stock issued and sold at the first closing pursuant to the stock purchase agreement have been duly and validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 4. the company's execution, delivery, performance and compliance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement do not violate (i) any provision of any applicable federal or state law or (ii) any provision of the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or bylaws. 5. all consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations of, and all qualifications, registrations, designations, declarations or filings with, any federal or delaware or california state governmental authority on the part of the company required in connection with the execution and delivery of the stock purchase agreement have been obtained, and are effective, except the filing required by section 25102(f) of the california corporate securities law of 1968, as amended. 6. based in part upon the representations made by you in the stock purchase agreement, the offer and sale of the common stock to you pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement are exempt from the registration requirements of section 5 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of section 4(2) thereof and from the qualification requirements of the california corporate securities law of 1968, as amended, by virtue of section 25102(f) thereof. our opinions expressed above are specifically subject to the following limitations, exceptions, qualifications and assumptions: (a) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the relief of debtors or the rights and remedies of creditors generally, including without limitation the effect of statutory or other law regarding fraudulent conveyances and preferential transfers. (b) we express no opinion as to the company's compliance or noncompliance with applicable federal or state antifraud or antitrust statutes, laws, rules and regulations. (c) limitations imposed by state law, federal law or general equitable principles upon the specific enforceability of any of the remedies, covenants or other provisions of any applicable agreement and upon the availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, regardless of whether enforcement of any such agreement is considered a proceeding in equity or at law. (d) the effect of court decisions, invoking statutes or principles of equity, which have held that certain covenants and provisions of agreements are unenforceable where enforcement of such covenants or provisions under the circumstances would violate the enforcing party's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (e) the unenforceability under certain circumstances of provisions expressly or by implication waiving broadly or vaguely stated rights, unknown future rights, or defenses to obligations or rights granted by law, when such waivers are against public policy or prohibited by law. (f) the unenforceability under certain circumstances of provisions to the effect that rights or remedies are not exclusive, that rights or remedies may be exercised without notice, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to or with any other right or remedy, that election of a particular remedy or remedies does not preclude recourse to one or more remedies, or that failure to exercise or delay in exercising rights or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such right of remedy. (g) the unenforceability under certain circumstances of provisions indemnifying a party against, or requiring contributions toward, that party's liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts, or where indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy. in this regard, we advise you that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission indemnification of directors, officers and controlling persons of an issuer against liabilities arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended, is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. (h) the effect of california law, federal law or equitable principles which limits the amount of attorneys' fees that can be recovered under certain circumstances. (i) the effect of subsequent issuances of securities of the company, to the extent that further issuances which may be integrated with the closing may include purchasers which do not meet the definition of "accredited investors" under rule 501 of regulation d and equivalent definitions under state securities or "blue sky" laws. this opinion is rendered as of the date first written above solely for your benefit in connection with the stock purchase agreement and may not be delivered to, quoted or relied upon by any person other than you, or for any other purpose, without our prior written consent. our opinion is expressly limited to the matters set forth above and we render no opinion, whether by implication or otherwise, as to any other matters relating to the company. we assume no obligation to advise you of facts, circumstances, events or developments which hereafter may be brought to our attention and which may alter, affect or modify the opinions expressed herein. very truly yours, brobeck, phleger & harrison somatix therapy corporation amended and restated registration rights agreement this amended and restated registration rights agreement (the "agreement"), is made as of the 15th day of august 1995 by and among somatix therapy corporation, a delaware corporation (the "company") and the persons set forth in exhibit a hereto (the "investors"). whereas, the company has previously entered into a registration rights agreement dated may 12, 1994 with the parties listed as signatories thereto (the "prior registration rights agreement"). whereas, the company now desires to issue certain securities having registration rights pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated as of august 15, 1995 (the "purchase agreement") between the company and bristol-myers squibb company ("bms"). whereas, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements set forth below and in the purchase agreement, the parties agree with each other as follows: 1. registration rights. the company covenants and agrees as follows: 1.1 definitions.

however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the company from that known to the holders of a majority of the shares at the time of their request that makes the proposed offering unreasonable in the good faith judgment of a majority in interest of the holders of the registrable securities, then the holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses. notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a withdrawal of registration by the holders of old registrable securities constitute a forfeiture of the right of bms to demand registration pursuant to section 1.2(b). 1.7 expenses of company registration. the company shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing or qualification of registrable securities with respect to the registrations pursuant to section 1.3 for each holder (which right may be assigned as provided in section 1.13), including, without limitation, all registration, filing and qualification fees, printing and accounting fees, listing fees and expenses, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling holders. underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities will be borne and paid ratably by the holders of such registrable securities. 1.8 underwriting requirements. in connection with any offering involving an underwriting of securities being issued by the company, the company shall not be required under section 1.3 to include any of the holders' securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the company and the 7. underwriters selected by it, and then, subject to the provisions of this section 1.8, only in such quantity, if any, as will not, in the opinion of the underwriters, jeopardize the success of the offering by the company. if the managing underwriter for an offering pursuant to which registrable securities are being registered pursuant to section 1.3 shall advise the company in writing that the total amount of securities, including registrable securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities proposed to be included in such offering that can be successfully offered, then the company shall include in the offering only that number of such securities, including registrable securities, which the managing underwriter believes will not jeopardize the success of the offering, the securities so included to be apportioned as follows: first all securities which stockholders other than the holders seek to include in the offering shall be excluded from the offering to the extent limitation on the number of shares included in the underwriting is required, and, if further limitation on the number of shares to be included in the underwriting is required, then the number of shares held by holders that may be included in the underwriting shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling holders or in such other apportions as shall be mutually agreed to by all such selling holders but in no event shall (i) the amount of registrable securities included in the offering be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount of securities included in such offering, and (ii) the amount of new investor securities included in the offering be reduced to below five percent (5%) of the total amount of securities included in such offering; provided, that if such offering is an underwritten offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 act covering the offer and sale of securities for the accounts of the company and selling shareholders to the public generally at a price per share (prior to underwriter discounts and commissions and offering expenses) of not less than $10.00 (appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock splits, stock combinations or stock dividends) in which the net proceeds to the company and selling shareholders (if any) are not less than $20,000,000, (i) the amount of registrable securities included in the offering shall not be reduced below fifty percent (50%), and (ii) the amount of new investor securities included in the offering shall not be reduced below ten percent (10%), in each case of the number of securities equal to the difference between (a) the total number of securities included in such offering and (b) the number of securities which, when multiplied by the price per share (prior to underwriter discounts and commissions and offering expenses) at which such securities are to be sold in such offering equals $10,000,000. for purposes of the preceding sentence for any selling shareholder which is a holder of registrable securities and which is a partnership or a corporation, the partners, retired partners and shareholders of such holder, or the estates and family members of such partners and retired partners and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be included as part of such `selling shareholder', and any pro rata reduction with respect to such 'selling shareholder' shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all such entities and individuals included in such 'selling stockholder', as defined in this sentence. 1.9 indemnification. in the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement under this section 1: (a) company indemnification. to the extent permitted by law, the 8. company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder, the officers, directors, partners, agents and employees of each holder, any underwriter (as defined in the 1933 act) for such holder, and each person, if any, who controls such holder or underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 act or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 act"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (a "violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the company of the 1933 act, the 1934 act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or any state securities law. the company will reimburse each such holder, officer, director, partner, agent, employee, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action. the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the company be liable to a holder in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action (i) to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by or on behalf of such holder, underwriter or controlling person or (ii) in the case of a sale directly by a holder of registrable securities (including a sale of such registrable securities through any underwriter retained by such holder to engage in a distribution solely on behalf of such holder), if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was contained in a preliminary prospectus and corrected in a final or amended prospectus, and such holder failed to deliver a copy of the final or amended prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the registrable securities to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability in any case where such delivery is required by the securities act. (b) holder indemnification. to the extent permitted by law, each selling holder will indemnify and hold harmless the company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the 1933 act, each agent and any underwriter for the company, and any other holder selling securities in such registration statement or any of its directors, officers, partners, agents or employees or any person who controls such holder or underwriter, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which the company or any such director, officer, controlling person, agent, or underwriter or controlling person, or other such holder or director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the 1933 act, the 1934 act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any 9. violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such holder expressly for use in connection with such registration and each such holder will reimburse any legal or other fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the company or any director, officer, agent or underwriter or controlling person, other holder, officer, director, partner, agent, employee, or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the liability of any holder hereunder shall be limited to the amount of gross proceeds received by such holder in the offering giving rise to the violation; and provided further that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.9(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld nor, in the case of a sale directly by the company of its securities (including a sale of such securities through any underwriter retained by the company to engage in a distribution solely on behalf of the company), shall the holder be liable to the company in any case which such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was contained in a preliminary prospectus and corrected in a final or amended prospectus, and the company or any underwriter failed to deliver a copy of the final or amended prospectus at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the securities to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 act. (c) notice, defense and counsel. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section 1.9 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this section 1.9, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. the failure of the indemnified party to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of receipt of the indemnified party of a notice of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this section 1.9 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this section 1.9. (d) contribution. if the indemnification provided for in this section 1 is unavailable to the indemnified parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such 10. indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the company, the holders and the underwriters from the offering of the securities, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the company, the holders and the underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative benefits received by the company, the holders and the underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by each of the company and the holders and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities. the relative fault of the company, the holders and the underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. the company and the holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this section 1.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. the amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the 1933 act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) survival of rights and obligations. the obligations of the company and the holders under this section 1.9 shall survive the completion of any offering of registrable securities in a registration statement whether under this section 1 or otherwise. 1.10 reports under securities exchange act of 1934. with a view to making available to the holders the benefits of rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 act and any other rule or regulation of the sec that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the company to the public without registration, and with a view to making it possible for holders to register the registrable securities pursuant to a registration on form s-3, the company agrees to: (a) make and keep public information available at all times, as those 11. terms are understood and defined in rule 144; (b) take such action, including the voluntary registration of its common stock under section 12 of the 1934 act, as is necessary to enable the holders to utilize form s-3 for the sale of their registrable securities; (c) file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the 1933 act and the 1934 act; and (d) furnish to any holder, so long as the holder owns any registrable securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of rule 144, the 1933 act and the 1934 act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to form s-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the company and such other reports and documents so filed by the company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any holder of any rule or regulation of the sec which permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form. 1.11 form s-3 registration. in case the company shall receive from any holder or holders of old registrable securities or new investor registrable securities a written request or requests that the company effect a registration on form s-3 (or on any successor form to form s-3 regardless of its designation) and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the registrable securities owned by such holder or holders, the company will: (a) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and any related qualification or compliance, to all other holders; and (b) use its best efforts to effect, as soon as practicable, such registration, qualification or compliance as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such holder's or holders' registrable securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the registrable securities of any other holder or holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within 20 days after receipt of such written notice from the company; provided, however, that the company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance, pursuant to this section 1.11: (1) if form s-3 (or any successor form to form s-3 regardless of its designation), is not available for such offering by the holders; (2) if the aggregate offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions of the registrable securities specified in such request is not at least $1,000,000; (3) if the company has already effected one registration on form s-3 within six months of the date on which the proposed registration will become effective (exclusive of registrations effected pursuant to sections 1.2 or 1.3 hereof); (4) in the case of the new investor registrable securities if such request is made after march 31, 1999, and in the case of the old 12. registrable securities until the third anniversary of the exercise of the kpcb warrant; or (5) if the company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the president of the company stating that in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the company, it would be seriously detrimental to the company and its stockholders for such form s-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which event the company shall have the right to defer the filing of the form s-3 registration for a period of not more than 90 days after receipt of the request of the holder or holders under this section 1.11; provided, however, that the company shall not utilize this right more than once in any twelve month period. (c) in the case of the new investor registrable securities until march 31, 1999 and in the case of the old registrable securities until the third anniversary of the date of exercise of the kpcb warrant (the "expense termination date"), all expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions relating to registrable securities incurred in connection with each of the registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to this section 1.11 including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printing and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the company, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling holders shall be borne by the company; provided, however, that, in the case of the old registrable securities, for each day after the date on which the company becomes eligible to register its securities on form s-3 that the company is once again ineligible to register its securities, the expense termination date will be one day later. 1.12 delay of registration. no holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this section 1; provided that this section 1.12 shall not apply to new investor in connection with a registration requested by new investor under section 1.2(a). 1.13 assignment and transfer of registration rights. the rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned by any holder to a holder or transferee of at least 50,000 shares of registrable securities if, prior to such proposed assignment, the company is furnished with at least five days prior written notice of the name and address of such proposed assignee and the registrable securities with respect to which such registration rights are proposed to be assigned; provided, however, that such rights and obligations with regard to any registrable securities may only be assigned in connection with the transfer of such registrable securities in accordance with the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement and the investment agreement. 1.14 company's support for secondary offerings. the company covenants and agrees to take any and all reasonable further action as may be requested by the holders to support any secondary offering of the company's securities by such holders, including (without limitation) participation in any informational meetings scheduled or arranged by any underwriter involved in selling such holders' securities. 13. 1.15 limitations on subsequent registration rights. from and after the date of this agreement, the company shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the company relating to registration rights unless such agreement includes: (a) to the extent the agreement would allow such holder or prospective holder to include such securities in any registration filed under section 1.2 or 1.11 hereof, a provision that such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of its securities will not reduce the amount of the registrable securities of the holders which would otherwise be included or in the judgment of the managing underwriter, adversely affect the registrable securities which would otherwise be included; (b) to the extent the agreement would allow such holder or prospective holder to include such securities in any registration effected pursuant to section 1.3 hereof, a provision that the rights of such holder to participate in such registration shall permit participation on no greater level than that of the holders;
