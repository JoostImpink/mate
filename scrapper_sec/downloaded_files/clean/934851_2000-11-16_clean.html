the base date or in case after such date the company (or any such other entity) shall consolidate with or merge into another entity or convey all or substantially all of its assets to another entity, then, and in each such case, the holder of this warrant upon the exercise thereof as provided in section 1 at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this warrant prior to such consummation, the securities or property to which such

(b)	if, at any time from the date of issuance of this warrant, the company shall issue or enter into any agreement to issue any shares of common stock other than excluded shares for consideration per share lower than the market price per share in effect immediately prior to such issuance, the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall be reduced (but shall not be increased) to the price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance by the factor determined by dividing (1) an amount equal to the sum of (a) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately prior to such issuance multiplied by the market price per share in effect immediately prior to such issuance and (b) the consideration, if any, received by the company upon such issuance by (2) the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after such issuance multiplied by the market price per share in effect immediately prior to such issuance; provided, however, no adjustment shall be made to the exercise price if (1) such issuance is in connection with a firm commitment underwritten public offering or (2) the consideration per share is equal to or greater than 85% of the market price per share in effect immediately prior to such issuance. for purposes hereof, the "market price" as of any measurement date shall be the average of the closing prices of the common stock for each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding such measurement date. (c)	the company will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holder of this warrant against dilution or other impairment. (d)	for further clarity, any change to the exercise price or other terms of the 8-1/4% subordinated convertible notes due 2003 shall not count to determining the reset period, but shall be taken into account in determining whether any adjustment to the exercise price is due under this section 6.3. (e)	the exercise price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as previously provided in this section 6.3. upon each adjustment of the exercise price, the holder of the warrant evidenced hereby shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the exercise price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of common stock (calculated to the nearest whole share pursuant to section 3) obtained by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product by the exercise price resulting from such adjustment. 6.4	certificate as to adjustments. in each case of an adjustment in the number of shares of warrant stock or other securities receivable on the exercise of this warrant, or the exercise price, the company at its expense will promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this warrant and prepare a certificate executed by an executive officer of the company setting forth such adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. the company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the holder. 6.5	notices of record date, etc. in case: (a)	the company shall take a record of the holders of its common stock (or other securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of the warrant) for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend at the same rate as the rate of the last cash dividend theretofore paid) or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right; or (b)	of any capital reorganization of the company, any reclassification of the capital stock of the company, any consolidation or merger of the company with or into another entity, or any conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to another entity; or (c)	of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, partial liquidation or winding up of the company, or (d)	any event resulting in the expiration of the reset period, then, and in each such case, the company shall mail or cause to be mailed to each holder of the warrant at the time outstanding a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place, and the time, if any, to be fixed, as to which the holders of record of common stock (or such other securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of the warrant) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of common stock (or such other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. such notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date therein specified. 7.	transfer to comply with the securities act. notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, this warrant and any warrant stock or other securities may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except as follows: (a) to a person who, in the opinion of counsel to the company, is a person to whom this warrant or the warrant stock or other securities may legally be transferred without registration and without the delivery of a current prospectus under the securities act with respect thereto;
