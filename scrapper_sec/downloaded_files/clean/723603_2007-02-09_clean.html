(c) registration statement form. registrations under this section 2.1 shall be on such appropriate form of registration statement promulgated by the commission as shall be selected by the company and as shall permit the disposition of the registrable securities so to be registered in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition specified in the request of the shareholder for such registration. the company agrees to include in any such registration statement all information which the shareholder shall reasonably request. (d) expenses. the company and the shareholder will each pay 50% of all registration expenses in connection with any registration requested pursuant to this section 2.1; provided, that the shareholder shall not be responsible for such registration expenses under this section 2.1 (together with any registration expenses paid by the shareholder under section 2.2) in excess of $50,000. 3 (e) selection of underwriters. if a requested registration pursuant to this section 2.1 involves a request by shareholder for an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters shall be selected by the company's board of directors, subject to the approval of the shareholder (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). (f) priority in requested registrations. if a requested registration pursuant to this section 2.1 involves a request by shareholder for an underwritten offering, and the managing underwriter shall advise the company in writing (with a copy to the shareholder) that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the company and the shareholder, the company will include in such registration to the extent of the number which the company is so advised can be sold in such offering registrable securities requested to be included in such registration. in the event that less than 80% of registrable securities requested to be included in the registration statement are included pursuant to this section 2.1(f), the company shall be required to effect one, and only one, additional registration pursuant to section 2.1(a); provided, however, that no request for such additional registration may be made by the shareholder prior to the expiration of 180 days after its initial request under section 2.1(a). 2.2 incidental registration.

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such registrable securities and other securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the shareholder shall reasonably request, to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains in effect and to take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the shareholder to consummate the disposition of the securities in such jurisdictions; provided, that the company shall not for any such purpose be required to (i) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for the requirements of this section 2.3(d), (ii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in such jurisdiction;

(g) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the commission and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of section 11(a) of the securities act, and will furnish to the shareholder at least five business days prior to the filing thereof a copy of any amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus;

and (j) obtain a legal opinion of the company's counsel, dated the effective date of such registration statement (or, if such registration includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement) as required by the underwriters, if any, or, if such registration does not include an underwritten public offering, in customary form and covering such matters customarily covered by opinion letters as the shareholder reasonably requests. the shareholder shall furnish the company with such information regarding such seller and the distribution of such securities as the company may from time to time reasonably request, including, without limitation, any financial information that the shareholder has or has used in the business to assist the company in the preparation of financial statements, if any, that are required pursuant to the commission's rules and regulations, within a reasonable time prior to the company's preparation of a registration statement with respect to the registrable securities or any other filing that the company is required to make with the commission. the shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the company of the happening of any event of the kind described in section 2.3(f), the shareholder will promptly discontinue the shareholder's disposition of registrable securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such registrable securities until the shareholder's receipt of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 2.3(f) and, if so directed by the company, the shareholder will use its reasonable efforts to deliver to the company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the shareholder's possession, of the prospectus relating to such registrable securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. in addition, the company may postpone the filing or effectiveness of a registration, or suspend the use of a registration statement, upon written notice to the shareholder (which notice need not disclose the reason for such postponement or suspension), for a period not to exceed 90 days, if the company reasonably believes that such registration might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any proposal or plan to engage in any material acquisition of assets or capital stock or any material merger, consolidation, tender offer or similar transaction or would otherwise require disclosure of material, nonpublic information which the board of directors of the company reasonably determines should not be disclosed. in the event the company shall give any such notice, the applicable time periods set forth above regarding the filing and effectiveness of registration statements required hereunder shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the shareholder shall have received the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by section 2.3(f) or the end of the postponement or suspension period (which, if not specified in the company's notice of such postponement or suspension, the company shall promptly provide upon the termination of the event giving rise to the postponement or suspension). the shareholder agrees that, during any period during which the use of a registration statement is suspended, it shall not make any offers or sales of registrable securities under such registration statement. 7 in the event that a registration statement covering the registrable securities is not declared effective by the commission within eight months of the date hereof, the provisions of article iii and article iv shall no longer apply. without limiting the remedies available to the shareholder, the company acknowledges that any failure to comply with its obligations hereunder may result in material irreparable injury to the shareholder for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such default, the shareholder may obtain such relief as may be requires to specifically enforce the company's obligations hereunder. 2.4 underwritten offerings.

(c) notices of claims, etc. promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this section 5.2, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 5.2, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. no indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which includes any admission of liability of such indemnified party or which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. 11 (d) indemnification payments. the indemnification required by this section 5.2 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred, subject to refund if the party receiving such payments is subsequently found not to have been entitled thereto hereunder.
