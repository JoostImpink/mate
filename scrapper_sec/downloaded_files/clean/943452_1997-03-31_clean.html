mr. fernandez, the chairman of the board, shall be nominated by the nominating committee to be elected to the board at the related stockholders' meeting, or by the directors already elected to the board, as the case may be, voting in conformity with such nomination. in furtherance thereof, each of the voting trust, vestar, harvard, vestar capital, aip, and each executive officer has agreed to vote all of the shares of common stock and any other voting securities of the issuer from time to time held by it or him in favor of, and each of the voting trust, vestar, harvard, vestar capital, aip and the executive officers has agreed to cause any shares of common stock or other voting securities of the issuer as to which it or he from time to time has the right to direct the vote to be voted

shares of common stock. subject to certain exceptions described below, until march 31, 2001, vestar, vestar capital, harvard, aip and the voting trust shall not page 17 of 31 pages assign, mortgage, change, hypothecate, give away or otherwise transfer (collectively, "transfer") any common stock owned or held by it or him. the foregoing does not restrict (i) the transferability of interests in the voting trust so long as any such transfer does not affect the underlying common stock and (ii) the ability of vestar capital to pledge the 40,000 shares of common stock currently held by vestar capital. notwithstanding the restrictions contained in the stockholders agreement, the following transfers are permitted: on or prior to march 31, 1998, shares of common stock owned by harvard, vestar and aip may be transferred (i) to affiliates or partners of such transferor who agree in a writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the issuer, to be bound by and subject to the provisions of the stockholders agreement, (ii) in connection with the exercise of "piggyback" registration rights granted to such transferor by the issuer, or (iii) in connection with any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction or any tender or exchange offer approved or recommended by the board. after march 31, 1998, shares of common stock owned by harvard, vestar and aip may be transferred as permitted under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) and (w) in an underwritten public offering, (x) in any disposition to a person which, to the best knowledge of harvard, vestar or aip, as the case may be, after due inquiry, will not beneficially own, together with such person's affiliates, a number of shares of common stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis which, when combined with the number of shares of common stock owned by harvard, vestar or aip, as the case may be, being disposed of in such disposition would constitute more than 6% of the shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, (y) to or through any broker, underwriter, placement agent or other financial intermediary, acting in such capacity, which undertakes in a writing reasonably satisfactory to the issuer to effect any subsequent transfer by it of such shares of common stock owned by harvard, aip or vestar, as the case page 18 of 31 pages may be, in an underwritten public offering or (z) to any person (other than any person which, to the best knowledge of harvard, vestar or aip, as the case may be, after due inquiry, is a competitor or customer of the issuer or has, prior to such sale, initiated or has been an active participant in an unsolicited change of control transaction by tender offer, proxy contest, consent solicitation or otherwise with respect to the issuer), provided that the issuer shall have a right of first offer (as described below) with respect to any shares of common stock owned by harvard, vestar or aip, as the case may be, proposed to be sold in accordance with this clause (z) unless the issuer shall have approved of such transfer in writing. if either harvard, vestar or aip proposes to sell any shares of common stock owned by harvard, vestar or aip, respectively, to a third party pursuant to the exception described in clause (z) above, the selling party shall not transfer such shares (the "offered shares") without first offering the offered shares to the issuer in accordance with the procedures set forth in the stockholders agreement. the issuer shall have the right to make an offer for the offered shares by notifying the selling party (such notice being referred to as an "election notice") at any time within 35 days of the issuer's receipt of a sale notice from such selling party, provided, that any such election notice from the issuer shall be irrevocable, shall contain all of the material terms and conditions the sale and shall be accompanied by a commitment letter from a bank or other responsible source of financing for such purchase or a certificate signed by the chief financial officer of the issuer certifying that the issuer has sufficient funds to purchase the offered shares. if the issuer fails to deliver an election notice within 35 days of receipt by the issuer of a selling party's sale notice or if the issuer otherwise advises the selling party in writing that the issuer does not intend to exercise its right to acquire the offered shares, such selling party shall be entitled to sell the offered shares to any other person without any requirement as to the terms and conditions of such sale; provided, that if such selling party does not sell the offered shares by the earlier to occur of 180 days from the expiration of the issuer's right to deliver an election notice or 180 days from written notice from page 19 of 31 pages the issuer that it does not intend to exercise its right to acquire the offered shares, the issuer's right of first offer shall again apply to the offered shares. if the issuer delivers its election notice for the offered shares within 35 days of receipt by the issuer of a selling party's sale notice, such selling party shall be entitled to offer the offered shares to any person pursuant to a third party sale at a price that is more favorable to such selling party than the price set forth in the issuer's election notice, provided that any such sale must occur within 180 days of the date of delivery of such election notice. notwithstanding the foregoing, if the selling party's sale notice is in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding common stock, the issuer shall be required, to the extent the issuer desires to purchase the offered shares, to exercise its right to so purchase, and to close such purchase of, the offered shares by the date which is the earlier of (i) 10 days following receipt of the related sale notice and (ii) the business day prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer. after march 31, 1998, harvard, vestar and aip shall be permitted to sell shares of common stock pursuant to and subject to the limitations set forth in rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"). notwithstanding any provision described herein to the contrary, holders (other than the executive officers) of trust certificates issued by the voting trust in exchange for shares of common stock are, to the extent permitted by the voting trust agreement, permitted to transfer shares of common stock held by the voting trust, withdraw such shares from the voting trust, and/or sell or otherwise dispose of common stock at any time. upon expiration of the voting trust, shares of common stock held by the voting trust may be distributed in accordance with the terms thereof and such shares will no longer be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the stockholders agreement. page 20 of 31 pages the stockholders agreement further provides that, except as set forth below, until march 31, 2001, none of the executive officers shall transfer any shares of common stock beneficially owned by him or any of his interest in the voting trust (treating any common stock held by the voting trust for the account of any of the executive officers as common stock owned by such person); provided that executive officers shall be permitted to transfer at any time shares of common stock in the circumstances described in the first sentence of the last paragraph on page 17 herein. each of the executive officers shall be permitted to transfer shares of common stock beneficially owned by him at any time in accordance with the terms of the voting trust agreement regardless of whether such person is a participant in the voting trust. each of the executive officers who is also a participant in the voting trust shall be permitted to withdraw shares of common stock from the voting trust at any time in accordance with the terms of the voting trust agreement, as in effect on march 5, 1997. so long as any of the executive officers continues to be an employee of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, such person, together with his permitted transferees, may transfer during each 12-month period following the effective date of the stockholders agreement, in the aggregate, 5% of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by such person on march 5, 1997. in the event that the employment of any executive officer with the issuer and its subsidiaries is terminated for any reason, such person, together with his permitted transferees, may transfer during each 12-month period following the effective date of such termination, in the aggregate, 20% of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by such person on the effective date of such termination. this restriction may be waived by the chairman of the board of the issuer as to any executive officer if such person delivers to the chairman of the board a request for waiver indicating that such waiver is page 21 of 31 pages required in order to alleviate personal hardship. the decision as to whether and to what extent to grant a waiver shall be in the sole discretion of the chairman of the board. each of the executive officers agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of shares of common stock owned by him or any similar security of the issuer, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, or any securities into which such securities are convertible or for which such securities are exchangeable or exercisable, during the 10 days prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the effective date of any registration statement in which securityholders are participating in connection with an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock (except as part of such registration), if and to the extent reasonably requested in writing (with reasonable prior notice) by the lead managing underwriter of the underwritten public offering. each of the executive officers agrees that no shares of common stock (or any interests in the voting trust) beneficially owned by him, his spouse or his minor children will be transferred unless the transferee agrees in a writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the issuer, to be bound by and subject to the provisions described in the proceeding paragraphs. shares of common stock held by the esop are not deemed to be beneficially owned by any of the executive officers for purposes of the stockholders agreement. shares of common stock held in the voting trust (other than shares deposited by the executive officers in the voting trust) also are not deemed to be beneficially owned by any of the executive officers for purposes of the stockholders agreement. common stock registration rights agreement the common stock registration rights agreement, dated as of march 5, 1997 (the "registration rights agreement"), among the issuer, harvard, aip, the voting trust, vestar, vestar capital, mr. fernandez, and mr. fernandez, as custodian for eric a. fernandez and ofelia b. fernandez page 22 of 31 pages (collectively, the "pulse shareholders"), provides for, among other things, the registration of sales of shares of common stock under the securities act by holders (as defined in the registration rights agreement) at the expense, subject to certain specified exceptions, of the issuer. harvard has the right to make two requests to the issuer for the registration of common stock owned by harvard. harvard's first request (the "first harvard demand") may be made at any time commencing after june 30, 1998. harvard's second request (the "second harvard demand") may be made at any time commencing one year after the consummation of any public offering of common stock made in connection with the exercise of the first harvard demand. one or both of the harvard demands may be made by an affiliate of harvard to which common stock owned by harvard has been transferred, but in no event shall harvard and such affiliate be permitted to make more than two demands in the aggregate. harvard also is permitted (but not at the issuer's expense) to make an unlimited number of requests for registration on form s-3 when the issuer is eligible to use such form. the voting trust has the right to make two requests to the issuer for the registration of common stock held by the voting trust. the voting trust's first and second requests may be made at any time that the first harvard demand and the second harvard demand, respectively, may be made. the voting trust also is permitted (but not at the issuer's expense) to make an unlimited number of requests for registration on form s-3 when the issuer is eligible to use such form. vestar has the right to make two requests to the issuer for the registration of common stock owned by vestar or vestar capital. vestar's first and second requests may be made at any time that the first harvard demand and the second harvard demand, respectively, may be made. one or both of the vestar demands may be made by an affiliate of vestar to which common stock owned by vestar has been transferred, but in no event shall vestar and such affiliate be permitted to make more than two page 23 of 31 pages demands in the aggregate. vestar also is permitted (but not at the issuer's expense) to make an unlimited number of requests for registration on form s-3 when the issuer is eligible to use such form. following a demand by harvard, the voting trust or vestar, the issuer must promptly give written notice of such requested registration to the other holders of common stock. the issuer must include in such registration all common stock of any holder with respect to which the issuer has received written requests for inclusion therein within 15 business days after the receipt by such holder of such notice. if the issuer at any time proposes to register any of its securities under the securities act (other than pursuant to the exercise by harvard, vestar or the voting trust of their demand registration rights) on any form other than form s-4 or s-8 (or any similar form then in effect) for sale for its own account or otherwise, and if the registration form proposed to be used may be used for the registration of common stock, the issuer will each such time give prompt written notice to all holders of common stock of its intention to do so. upon the written request of any such holder made within 30 days after the receipt of any such notice, the issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration of all common stock requested by such holder to be registered. the issuer shall not be obligated to file a registration statement, or file any amendment or supplement thereto, and may suspend the sellers' rights to make sales pursuant to an effective registration statement, if the issuer reasonably believes that the filing thereof at the time requested, or the offering of securities pursuant thereto, would adversely affect a pending or proposed public offering of the issuer's securities, a financing, acquisition, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction, or negotiations, discussions or pending proposals relating thereto, of the issuer or would otherwise be seriously detrimental to the issuer and its stockholders. if the issuer suspends the sellers' right to make sales pursuant to an effective registration statement, the applicable registration period shall be extended by the number of days of such page 24 of 31 pages suspension, and if the issuer delays the filing with the securities and exchange commission of a registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or the effectiveness of such registration statement, harvard, the voting trust or vestar, as the case may be, may withdraw its request and thereafter shall be entitled to make one additional demand registration request in lieu of the withdrawn request. the registration rights agreement provides that in an underwritten offering the issuer may reduce the number of shares to be registered by the issuer and the holders, in accordance with the priority provisions set forth therein, if the lead managing underwriter advises the issuer that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering within a price range stated as being acceptable by the holder requesting registration. in certain circumstances where the number of shares of common stock to be registered has been so reduced, harvard, the voting trust and vestar shall have the right to make an additional demand for registration at the issuer's expense. the issuer has agreed not to grant to any person registration rights which (i) are exercisable prior to the time when registration rights under the registration rights agreement are first exercisable, (ii) would result in the deferral of a demand registration which could otherwise be affected under the registration rights agreement, (iii) which would operate to reduce the number of shares of common stock which could be registered pursuant to a demand registration under the registration rights agreement by harvard, vestar or the voting trust, (iv) except with respect to common stock issued by the issuer in the future, which would operate to reduce the number of shares of common stock which could be registered in any other registration under the registration rights agreement or (v) would have priority for inclusion in any registration under the registration rights agreement or any common stock of any holder. page 25 of 31 pages the registration rights agreement also contains certain holdback, indemnity and contribution provisions. buyers letter agreement the letter agreement, dated march 5, 1997 (the "buyers letter agreement"), among vestar, harvard and aip provides, among other things, that neither vestar, harvard nor aip shall transfer any common stock owned or held by it without the prior written consent of (i) harvard, in the case of any transfer by vestar, (ii) vestar, in the case of any transfer by harvard, and (iii) each of vestar and harvard, in the case of any transfer by aip; provided that if any of such parties transfers a percentage of the common stock owned or held by it, each of the other parties to the buyers letter agreement may transfer the same percentage of the common stock owned or held by it in separate transactions or as provided in the registration rights agreement. notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding sentence (but in any event subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the stockholders agreement), each of vestar, harvard and aip are permitted to transfer any common stock owned or held by it without any prior written consent as required above if such transfer is to any affiliate (as defined in the stockholders agreement), other than (i) in the case of vestar or aip, an affiliate that is a limited partner of vestar or aip, as the case may be, and (ii) in the case of harvard, an affiliate that is a stockholder of harvard that does not control or wholly own harvard, directly or indirectly. the buyers letter agreement also provides that if vestar and harvard propose to transfer common stock owned or held by them pursuant to an exception to the transfer restrictions in the stockholders agreement which is described in clause (x) or (z) on pages 17 and 18 hereof and the last sentence of the preceding paragraph, then vestar and harvard shall have the obligation, and aip shall have the right, to require the proposed transferee to purchase from aip up to a number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by aip page 26 of 31 pages and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the total number of shares of common stock held by vestar and harvard which are actually included in the contemplated transfer and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by vestar and harvard. such purchase shall be made at the same price per share of common stock and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions applicable to vestar and harvard. additionally, if vestar and harvard receive an offer from a third party which is not an affiliate of either vestar or harvard to purchase all of the shares of common stock owned by vestar and harvard and such offer is accepted by vestar and harvard, then aip, upon the written request of vestar and harvard, will transfer all shares of common stock owned by it to such purchaser on the same terms and subject to the same conditions that are applicable to vestar and harvard. if either vestar or harvard proposes to transfer common stock owned or held by it in an underwritten offering or pursuant to rule 144 of the securities act, it shall give aip written notice of such proposed transfer at the time vestar or harvard gives notice to the other of such proposed transfer and in any event at least three business days prior to the consummation of such proposed transfer. the foregoing provisions of the buyers letter agreement expire on march 31, 2001. letter agreement of management purchasers party to the stockholders agreement in the letter dated march 20, 1997 (the "letter agreement of management purchasers party to the stockholders agreement") from each of the management purchasers who is a party to the stockholders agreement to vestar, harvard, aip and the issuer, each of such management purchasers agreed that prior to april 1, 1998, none of the shares of common stock acquired by such management purchaser pursuant to the stock purchase agreement (the "acquired shares") will be transferred (as defined in the stockholders agreement), except in the circumstances described in the first sentence

party to the stockholders agreement to vestar, harvard, aip and the issuer, each of such management purchasers agreed that prior to april 1, 1998 none of such management purchaser's acquired shares will be transferred (as defined in the stockholders agreement), except in the circumstances described in the first sentence of the last paragraph on page 17 herein; provided that such acquired shares may be pledged as collateral to a bona fide financial institution to secure a loan obtained for the purpose of financing such management purchaser's purchase of such acquired shares. thereafter, acquired shares owned by such management purchasers will not be transferred except as follows: (i) to immediate family members, a corporation controlled by such management purchaser or his immediate family, or grantor or other trusts or other vehicles for tax, estate or financial planning purposes; (ii) as collateral security for a loan or other credit; (iii) in the event of personal hardship; (iv) up to one-third of the acquired shares can be transferred and/or released from the letter agreement of management purchasers not party to the stockholders agreement each calendar year; except that this exception is limited to 5% of acquired shares each year for management purchasers who are also corporate officers of the issuer; (v) following termination of employment of such management purchaser by the issuer. page 28 of 31 pages the provisions of the letter agreement of management purchasers not party to the purchase agreement will expire on the earlier of (x) march 31, 2001 and

provided, that the failure of the indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this section 4, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. in case any such action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or proceeding or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party therein or (iii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded party) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and (x) there are one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party and which result in a conflict between the indemnifying party and such indemnified party or (y) the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to differing interests between them, in either which case under the preceding clause (iii), if the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that the indemnified party elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party. no indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties.
