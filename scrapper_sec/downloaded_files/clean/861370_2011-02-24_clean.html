chief operating officer wu hong wei &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; secretary additionally, effective as of closing mr. r.c. cunningham iii resigned as a director and the authorized number of directors who may serve on the board of directors was increased to three (3).&#160;&#160;as currently scheduled, mr. cunningham ii will resign as a director effective as of the 10th day following the issuer&#8217;s effective filing of a schedule 14f-1 with the sec, whereupon messrs. huang jin bei and wu hong wei will be appointed to the board of directors to assume the vacancies created by the resignation of mr. cunningham ii and the increase to the authorized number of directors, as previously approved. further, in anticipation of the exchange the issuer caused a certificate of designation of series a convertible preferred stock to be filed with the oklahoma secretary of state effective february 11, 2011, thereby creating and designating the series a shares in order to conduct the exchange.&#160;&#160;although the series a shares are not a class of the issuer&#8217;s securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the exchange act of 1934, as amended, the rights, preferences and privileges set forth in the certificate of designation provide that the series a shares shall have the same voting rights as the shares; except, however, that each series a share is afforded the right of 1,000 voting shares based on the conversion rate established in the certificate of designation. &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; &#160; in addition, as also contemplated in the exchange agreement it is the present intention to proceed with causing the issuer to effect a 1-for-18.29069125 reverse stock split (the &#8220;reverse split&#8221;) as soon as is practicable.&#160;&#160;the reverse split is contemplated and will be structured to affect the outstanding shares of the issuer&#8217;s class of common stock, whereupon effect all of the outstanding series a shares will be automatically converted into shares at the conversion rate of 1,000-for-1.&#160;&#160;the desired effect of the reverse split is to cause the cwt shareholders at the close of the exchange agreement to become the holders of at least 96% of the issuer&#8217;s shares. subsequent to all other provisions of the exchange agreement, the issuer is obligated to issue the control stockholders additional shares subject to a certain event (the &#8220;make good provision&#8221;).&#160;&#160;in the event the issuer&#8217;s net income is less than $5.5 million (the &#8220;income minimum&#8221;), as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, for the audited financial statements for year ended december 31, 2010, the control stockholders are entitled to receive an aggregate 113,637 shares (post consolidation) from the issuer. such determination of the income minimum and satisfaction of the make good provision will be addressed within 10 days following completion of the audit for the issuer&#8217;s financials for year ended december 31, 2010. the issuer&#8217;s certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 undesignated shares.&#160;&#160;the undesignated shares may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by the shareholders.&#160;&#160;these terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.&#160;&#160;the issuance of any undesignated shares could diminish the rights of holders of shares, and therefore could reduce the value of such shares.&#160;&#160;in addition, specific rights granted to future holders of undesignated shares co uld be used to restrict the issuer&#8217;s ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party.&#160;&#160;the ability of the board of directors to issue undesignated shares could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent the issuer&#8217;s shareholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price for the shares. subject to and depending upon prices deemed favorable, the reporting persons may purchase additional shares of the issuer from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties.&#160;&#160;further, while it is not the present intention of the reporting persons to do so, they reserve the right to dispose of any shares held in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties or otherwise, depending upon market conditions and other factors. subject to ongoing evaluation, except as otherwise set forth above, the reporting persons have no current plans or proposals which relate to or would otherwise result in any of the following: (a)&#160;&#160; the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the issuer, or the disposition of securities of the issuer; (b)&#160;&#160; an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c)&#160;&#160; a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d)&#160;&#160; any change in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e)&#160;&#160; any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the issuer; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; &#160; (f)&#160;&#160; any other material change in the issuer&#8217;s business or corporate structure including, but not limited to, if the issuer is a registered closed-end investment company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment policy for which a vote is required by section 13 of the investment company act of 1940; (g)&#160;&#160; changes in the issuer&#8217;s charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the issuer by any person; (h)&#160;&#160; causing a class of securities of the issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i)&#160;&#160; a class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or (j)&#160;&#160; any action similar to any of those enumerated above. item 5.&#160;&#160;interest in securities of the issuer &#160; (a) the reporting persons are deemed to beneficially own an aggregate 300,607,511 shares, consisting of 16,435 series a shares (which includes the conversion voting rights for the series a shares).&#160;&#160;based on the current voting rights afforded to the series a shares such aggregate beneficial ownership constitutes 82.2% ownership of the outstanding class of shares (without accounting for reverse split), determined in accordance with rule 13d-3(d)(1).&#160;&#160;the percentage calculation is based upon 14,632,553 outstanding shares as disclosed in the exchange agreement and as reported in the issuer&#8217;s most recent current report on form 8-k, as filed with the sec on february 14, 2011. &#160;
