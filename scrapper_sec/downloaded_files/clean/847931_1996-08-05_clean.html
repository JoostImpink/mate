("isa"), renaissance capital partners ii limited ("renaissance"), certain holders of the $1.8 million bridge loan ("bridge lenders") and coded communications corporation ("coded") this 1st day of may, 1996. whereas, all the parties to this agreement desire to recapitalize coded so as to enable coded to operate efficiently and effectively for the benefit of its customer, shareholders, investors and employees; and whereas, the parties have a desire to avoid the liquidation or foreclosure of the assets of coded; now, therefore, in consideration of mutual promises by and between the parties to this agreement, and for other valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: 1. current arrangements between coded and isa. 1.1 isa order and deposit. upon execution of this agreement and implementation of paragraph 1.2, isa shall immediately place an order for approximately one million dollars ($us) worth of goods and/or services with coded and shall deposit $500,000 ($us) against this order placed with coded. 1.2 management and control. upon receiving the approximately $1.0 million dollar ($us) order and receiving the $500,000 ($us) deposit, coded shall be deemed to have granted isa the right to manage and control the day to day operations of coded, including but not limited to the right to negotiate and enter into arrangements on behalf of coded to restructure the trade payables and other debt of coded. isa will work with coded to preserve working relationships and vendor good will to the extent that such can or should be preserved. coded shall execute such debt restructure agreements negotiated by isa on coded's behalf as partial consideration for the order and deposit being placed by isa and the other provisions of this agreement. this grant to isa shall terminate upon the expiration of the option period described below. cusip no. 19-1908102 page 14 of 37 pages 1.3 grant of option to isa. coded hereby grants to isa an option to (1) acquire 66.7% of the coded common stock and (2) to become the exclusive distributor for coded in all of mexico, central and south america during the eighteen months following exercise of the option (provided that while isa is the exclusive distributor for coded in these areas isa can not sell products competitive to the coded product line), all in exchange for $400,000 in cash, a loan of $1.0 million, the promise to place at least $10.0 million in orders over eighteen months from the signing of this agreement and for inducing renaissance and the bridge lenders to make modifications to their positions, the other consideration set forth herein, all as more definitively set forth in this agreement. this option may be exercised if at all by faxing a written exercise of option to coded at (619) 438-8796 within sixty days of execution of this agreement. isa may, at its sole option, extend this time period to a date twenty days after shareholder approval is secured for those terms of this agreement that require shareholder approval. upon exercise of the option, coded shall immediately issue to isa an amount of coded common shares on an "after-conversion" basis (see paragraph 4.1) equal to 66.7% of outstanding common shares. by way of example, isa shall be issued 49,005,703 common shares if there are outstanding on an "after-conversion" basis 73,441,005 shares of common stock on the date of the closing of this transaction as shown in paragraph 4.1. this common stock shall have one demand registration right with reasonable registration costs to be borne by coded. the terms of the registration right will be at least as favorable as the terms of the registration right agreement between renaissance and coded entered into at the time of the original debenture. 1.4 contribution to pay bridge loan. upon signing of this agreement, isa shall place $400,000 into escrow at a united states banking or trust institution selected by renaissance in the name of coded to be release as a capital contribution to coded or returned as follows: (a) if the shareholders decline to approve the transactions described in this agreement that require shareholder approval within sixty days (or as extended as isa's sole option), then the funds shall be returned to isa immediately. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if the shareholders decline to so approve, then isa shall be deemed to have been granted a three year exclusive distributorship for coded products for mexico, central and south america without any performance requirements, but otherwise with terms similar to distributorship agreements that coded presently has with others. (b) if the shareholders approve the transactions described in this agreement within sixty days (or as extended at isa's sole option) and isa does not exercise the option, then $200,000 shall be released to coded. the remaining $200,000 shall be immediately returned to isa. cusip no. 19-1908102 page 15 of 37 pages (c) if the shareholders approve the transaction described in this agreement

bridge loan. see paragraph 3.2.1. this provision will constitute irrevocable instructions to the escrow holder. 2. post-option exercise arrangements between isa and coded. 2.1 isa orders to coded. during the 18-month period commencing on the date of this agreement and provided the option is exercised, isa will cause to be placed with coded, orders for at least $10 million. such orders shall be negotiated at arms length with terms comparable to coded's customary terms, prices and conditions offered to its most favored customer, agent or dealer similarly situated in any part of the world. 2.2 escrow of stock. isa shall place 24 million shares of common stock received through exercise of the option into an escrow account. during such time as the shares are held in escrow, isa shall have the right to vote all shares and will enjoy any other benefits derived from the beneficial ownership of such shares including dividends. in the event isa does not cause to be place with coded over an 18 month period beginning on the date of execution of this agreement (and provided the option is exercised), order for $10,000,000 (which includes the initial $1.0 million order referred to in paragraph 1.1 above) with terms and conditions as described in paragraph 2.1 above, then any shares remaining in escrow shall be transferred to coded treasury and retired. the number of shares to be transferred to coded shall be equal to an amount calculated by multiplying the difference between $10 million in orders and the actual amount of orders placed with coded over the 18-month period, times 2.4. by way of example, if $8.5 million in orders are placed or caused to be placed by isa over the eighteen month period, then coded shall receive and retire 3.6 million shares from the escrow. during the 18-month period isa shall receive shares certificates on an as earned basis from the escrow with distribution of share certificates to occur quarterly. 2.3 isa loan to coded. at the transaction closing, isa shall advance cash of $1,000,000 to coded in exchange for a secured promissory note. the promissory note shall have a maturity date of 12 months, with an interest rate of 6%, interest payable quarterly. the promissory note shall be collateralized by a senior security interest in the assets of coded and its subsidiaries decom systems inc. and coded mobile communications. the amount of the funds advanced may be increased from time to time at the sole discretion of isa and such advance will be reflected in the secured promissory note. isa shall have the right to convert the entire amount of the initial $1.0 million loan to common stock at the conversion rate of cusip no. 19-1908102 page 16 of 37 pages $0.25 to one share of common. this conversion right will be protected from dilution as follows: split up of combination of shares: in case issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall be subdivided or split up into a greater number of shares of common stock, the conversion price shall be proportionally decreased, and in the case issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of common stock, the conversion price shall be proportionately increased, such increase or decrease, as the case may be, becoming effective at the time of record of the split-up or combination, as the case may be. adjustment for mergers, consolidations, etc.: (1) in case of any capital reorganization, reclassification of the stock of borrower (other than a change in par value or as a result of a stock dividend, subdivision, split up or combination of shares), or consolidation or merger of borrower with or into another person or entity (other than a consolidation or merger in which borrower is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any change in the common stock) or of the sale, exchange, lease, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of borrower as an entity or the participation by borrower in share exchange as the corporation the stock of which is to be acquired, this shall be convertible into kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of borrower (or of the corporation resulting from such consolidation or surviving such merger or to which such properties and assets shall have been sold, exchanged, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed, or which was the corporation whose securities were exchanged for those of borrower), to which the holder herein would have been entitled to receive if the holder owned the common stock issuable upon conversion of this instrument immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. the provisions of these foregoing sentence shall similarly apply to successive organizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, exchanges, leases, transfers or other dispositions or other share exchanges. 2.4 board. after the option is exercised coded shall cooperate to cause isa to have the right to appoint a majority of the members of the coded board of directors, including the chairman of the board. cusip no. 19-1908102 page 17 of 37 pages 2.5 exclusive distributorship. provided isa provides orders of at least $10 million during the eighteen month period following the execution of this agreement then isa's appointment pursuant to paragraph 1.3 as the exclusive distributor for coded in mexico, central and south america shall become an exclusive distributorship for an additional three year period with continuing three year extensions to isa provided isa's performance has been reasonably satisfactory. while isa is the exclusive distributor for coded in these areas isa can not sell products competitive to the coded product line. this exclusive distributorship shall be on customary terms similar to existing distributorship agreements that coded presently has with others. should a dispute arise as to what are customary terms, it shall be settled by arbitration. 3. modification of senior secured debt positions upon exercise of the option. should isa decide, in its sole discretion, that a restructure of the trade payable and other debt of coded is feasible, secures enforceable written agreements evidencing reductions in those debts and it exercises the option, then renaissance and the bridge lenders shall be deemed to have immediately modified their positions with coded as follows: 3.1 restructuring of $4.0 million debenture 3.1.1 amendment of debenture. upon exercise of the option, renaissance, isa and coded agree that renaissance will amend the $4.0 million principal amount, 12% convertible debenture, and all interest accrued and payable thereon through the date of execution of this agreement, totaling $4.8

subordinated to existing senior debt, future working capital debt, the bridge lenders as set forth herein and the isa promissory note described herein. 3.1.3 conversion right. the amended debenture shall be converted into series b preferred stock under the following conditions: (a) at any time that the value of the shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of series b preferred stock is equal to 70% or more of the principal amount of the 6% debenture ($3.36 million if the principal amount of the 6% debenture is $4.8 million) or (b) at a time prior to the coded common stock

(c) minimum valuation. isa agrees that renaissance shall be guaranteed against a market decline in the underlying value of the 7,344,101 coded common shares so as to maintain a minimum valuation of $3.36 million dollars. therefore, it is agreed that if at the end of three years from the date of closing, the underlying coded common stock market value of the series b preferred stock is less than $3.36 million, then isa will convey to renaissance up to a maximum of 7,344,000 shares of coded common stock so as to compensate (as far as that number of shares goes) for the market value deficit below $3.36 million. to assure performance, isa shall concurrently with the conversion of the renaissance convertible debenture into series b preferred stock, escrow 7,344,000 shares of coded common owned by isa with an independent party. isa shall have the right to vote all shares and will enjoy any other benefits derived from the beneficial ownership of such shares including dividends. renaissance agrees that coded may require the conversion of the debenture into series b preferred stock any time after august 1, 1996 if either of the following two conditions occur: * coded's net worth equals or exceeds $1.0 million with no more than $500,000 of that net worth attributable to reversal of balance sheet reserves; or * at renaissance's option coded's net worth equals or exceeds $500,000 with no reversal of balance sheet reserves.

("isa"), renaissance capital partners ii limited ("rencap"), and coded communications corporation, a california corporation ("coded"), each of whom agree as follows: 1. recitals. this agreement is entered into based on the following essential facts, the accuracy of which the parties acknowledge: 1.1 coded is suffering severe cash flow problems and needs financing for working capital and the retirement of debt. in an attempt to satisfy its financial needs, coded entered into the mutual agreement of terms and conditions as of may 1, 1996, with isa, rencap, and others (the "multi-party agreement"). 1.2 because of the delays in closing the transactions contemplated by the multi-party agreement and in restructuring the debt of coded, isa's relationship with coded has become strained and coded's potential business opportunities in mexico and latin america are in jeopardy if it does not soon provide its products and services. 1.3 to help meet coded's needs, isa is willing to immediately make the $1,000,000.00 loan to coded described in section 2.3 of the multi-party agreement (the "loan"), and to concurrently convert the loan into equity in accordance with the multi-party agreement. by the conversion, coded will avoid the burden of additional debt, and improve its liquidity and capital position. 1.4 isa additionally is willing to accelerate its purchase orders described in the multi-party agreement (to which isa is not required to make). in accordance with this agreement, isa will place $1,000,000.00 in purchase orders with coded (along with a $250,000.00 deposit in accordance with coded's standard international terms of sale), thereby raising the amount of its purchase orders with coded to $2,000,000.00 (which is approximately 20 percent of its total order requirement under the multi-party agreement). the parties intend that isa receive five million of the approximately forty-nine million shares to which isa is entitled under the multi-party agreement (which represents about ten percent of the shares released to isa on account of isa's potential purchase orders). cusip no. 19-1908102 page 33 of 37 pages 1.5 the parties intend that isa accelerate an additional $1,000,000.00 of purchase orders to coded (along with an additional $250,000.00 advance in accordance with coded's standard international terms of sale), on which coded is expected to realize a gross margin of $450,000.00, in exchange for the issuance to isa of one million shares of coded's stock. 1.6 upon consummation of this agreement, coded will have recieved $3,000,000.00 of the $10,000,000.00 (i.e., thirty percent) worth of orders to which isa may ultimately be committed under the multi-party agreement (which includes $1,000,000.00 of isa's orders placed with coded before the date of this agreement), along with total deposits on such orders in the amount of $1,000,000.00, as well as $1,000,000.00 of additional equity; and isa will own ten million shares of coded's common stock. 2. isa orders to coded. 2.1 acceleration of orders under multi-party agreement. on or before july 24, 1996, isa shall place with coded a binding purchase order for at least one million dollars (us $1,000,000) worth of coded's goods and services, and shall deposit two hundred fifty thousand dollars (us $250,000) with coded towards the purchase order. the purchase order will be made pursuant to the multi-party agreement, and the order will be credited towards the purchase orders required by isa under section 2.1 of the multi-party agreement. because isa is accelerating the purchase orders to coded, promptly on coded's receipt of the orders described in this paragraph, coded shall issue isa or its assignee five million shares of coded's common stock. such shares will be credited towards the stock to be issued to isa under section 1.3 of the multi-party agreement (i.e., forty-four million eight thousand seven hundred and three [44,008,703] shares of coded's common stock will remain subject to the option described in the multi-party agreement). the shares will be issued in the name of isa or its permitted assignee, in the form of five separate certificates, each in the amount of one million shares, and isa or its assignee will be entitled to one demand registration right of the same nature to which isa is entitled in connection with the stock it receives under the multi-party agreement. 2.2 additional orders for additional shares. on or before july 24, 1996, isa shall place with coded a binding purchase order for an additional one million cusip no. 19-1908102 page 34 of 37 pages dollars (us $1,000,000) worth of coded's goods and services and shall deposit two hundred fifty thousand dollars (us $250,000) with coded towards the purchase order. the purchase order will be credited towards the purchase orders referenced in the multi-party agreement. in consideration of, and promptly on receipt of, the additional purchase order and deposit described in the preceding sentence, coded shall issue isa or its assignee one million shares of coded's common stock. such shares do not apply to the stock to be issued to isa under section 1.3 of the multi-party agreement. the shares will be issued in the form of a single certificate in the name of isa or its permitted assignee, and isa or its assignee will be entitled to one demand registration right of the same nature to which isa is entitled in connection with the stock it receives under the multi-party agreement. 3. production of isa orders. ing. fernando pliego, a representative of isa, may inspect, monitor and coordinate coded's production and delivery of products and services to isa. coded shall reimburse isa ten thousand dollars (us $10,000) per month for isa's costs of retaining mr. pliego until coded completes the products and services under the purchase orders made in accordance with section 1.2 above. mr. pliego will be granted access to the operations of coded as reasonably necessary to inspect, monitor and coordinate such orders, except that mr. pliego will not be provided access to any areas, documents, or information relating to coded's (or its subsidiaries') operations pursuant to contracts with the united states department of defense (the "dod") or to any arcas, documents or information relating to material deemed classified by the dod. mr. pliego will have no right to control any aspect of coded's (or any of coded's subsidiaries') operations and in no way may mr. pliego be deemed an agent or employee of coded or any subsidiary of coded. isa is solely responsible for mr. pliego's employment and actions. 4. funding of isa loan and exercise of conversion election. isa shall make the loan on or before july 24, 1996. isa elects that the loan immediately be converted to shares of coded's common stock in accordance with section 2.3 of the multi-party agreement, so that immediately on coded's receipt of the loan funds: (a) coded shall issue isa or its assignee the shares of coded's common stock required under the conversion provisions of section 2.3 of the multi-party agreement, (i.e., four million shares); and (b) the loan is extinguished and coded has no repayment obligation in connection with the loan funds. 5. no shareholder approval required. this agreement is effective immediately on mutual execution by isa and coded and no approval by coded's shareholders is required. the enforceability of this agreement is unaffected by any approval or disapproval by coded's shareholders of the transactions contemplated by the multi-party agreement. cusip no. 19-1908102 page 35 of 37 pages 6. isa's rights as shareholder. upon isa's or its assignee's receipt of the shares issued to it under this agreement, isa will own all legal and beneficial right, title and interest in and to the shares, subject to the rights of no other person or entity, and isa will have all rights of a common-stock shareholder in coded, including the right to vote its shares. 7. waiver of conversion price reduction under debenture. rencap waives the provisions of paragraph 5(b)(i) and (ii) of the coded 12% convertible debentures as such provisions would apply to the issuance of coded's shares under this agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the shares being issued to isa in connection with this agreement are at a value per share less than the conversion price set forth in the coded 12% convertible debentures. 8. miscellaneous. 8.1 governing law, venue and jurisdiction. this agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of california, irrespective of california's choice-of-law principles. all actions and proceedings arising in connection with this
