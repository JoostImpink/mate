(a)-(c); (f) this statement is filed by each of the purchaser entities. the information concerning the name, state or other place of organization, principal business and address of the principal office of each purchaser entity, and the information concerning the name, business address, present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment or occupation is conducted, and citizenship of each of the executive officers and directors of each purchaser entity is attached as exhibit 1. (d) and (e) during the last five years, none of the purchaser entities, nor, to the knowledge of any of the purchaser entities, any of the directors or executive officers of any of the purchaser entities has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which any such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation of such laws. item 3. source and amount of funds or other consideration the total amount of funds required by purchaser to purchase all of the shares pursuant to the offer (as defined below) and the merger (as defined below) is estimated to be approximately $11.8 million, excluding the cash out of 2,649,250 options and 333,333 warrants. the offer and the merger are not conditioned upon the purchaser entering into any financing arrangements. purchaser intends to obtain all required funds from parent, and parent will obtain such funds from available working capital. item 4. purpose of transaction. on october 18, 2001, parent, purchaser and the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"). the following is a summary of the merger 4 agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the merger agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is filed as exhibit 2 hereto and which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. the merger agreement provides for the commencement, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10 days after the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement on october 19, 2001, by purchaser of a cash tender offer (the "offer") to purchase all of the shares for $1.00 per share (the "offer price"), net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement. the purpose of the offer is for purchaser to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, the company. provided sufficient shares are acquired by purchaser, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, purchaser will be merged with and into the company (the "merger"), with the company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "surviving corporation") as a wholly owned subsidiary of parent. in the event purchaser acquires at least 90% of the shares, purchaser will commence a short-form merger pursuant to section 253 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware in order to effect the merger (a "short-form merger"). to facilitate a short-form merger, the company has granted to parent and purchaser an irrevocable option, exercisable if parent and purchaser accept for payment pursuant to the offer more than 75% but less than 90% of the shares then outstanding, to purchase additional shares of common stock from the company, at a price per share equal to the offer price, in order to reach the 90% threshold. if purchaser is unable to acquire 90% of the shares, but at least a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis are tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer (the "minimum condition") and the merger agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, the company will hold a stockholders meeting in order to effect the merger. at any such stockholders meeting, all of the shares then owned by parent and purchaser and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates will be voted to approve the merger. the purpose of the merger is for parent to acquire all shares not purchased pursuant to the offer. pursuant to the offer, and from time to time thereafter as shares are acquired by purchaser, parent or their affiliates, purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the board of directors of the company (the "company board") as will give purchaser, subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the exchange act, representation on the company board equal to that number of directors which equals the product of the total number of directors on the company board (giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional directors pursuant to this paragraph and including current directors serving as officers of the company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by parent, purchaser or any of their affiliates (including such shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the offer, but excluding shares held by the company or any of its subsidiaries) bears to the total number of shares then issued and outstanding. the company has agreed, upon request by purchaser, to promptly increase the size of the company board as is necessary to enable purchaser's designees to be elected to the company board and to cause purchaser's designees to be so elected. also, under the merger agreement, the directors of purchaser shall become the directors of the surviving corporation 5 at the effective time of the merger. the purchaser does not expect to name any directors until completion of the offer upon the minimum condition. in contemplation of entering into the merger agreement, and in order to increase the likelihood that the minimum condition will be satisfied and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement consummated, parent and purchaser entered into a stockholders agreement, dated october 18, 2001 (the "stockholders agreement"), with certain current and former officers and directors of the company (each, a "significant holder"). the following is a summary of the stockholders agreement. this summary is not a complete description of the stockholders agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the stockholders agreement, which is filed as exhibit 3 hereto and which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. pursuant to the stockholders agreement, each significant holder has agreed to tender in the offer all shares owned beneficially and of record by him or her. each significant holder has also agreed, among other things, to vote his or her shares in favor of the merger and the merger agreement and against any alternative takeover proposal. each significant holder has also granted to parent and purchaser, or any of their nominees, an irrevocable proxy to demand that the company call a special meeting to consider the merger and the merger agreement and to vote such significant holder's shares in respect of such matter at every meeting of the stockholders of the company, however called (the "proxy"). the significant holders have also each granted to parent and purchaser an irrevocable option (the "company securities option") to purchase their shares at a price per share equal to the offer price or any higher price paid or to be paid by parent or purchaser pursuant to the offer or the merger. the company securities option becomes exercisable, in whole but not in part, for all shares subject thereto not accepted for payment in the offer, at the close of business on the expiration date of the offer, if, but only if, purchaser has accepted for payment all shares tendered and not withdrawn, and the company securities option shall remain exercisable for 60 days from such date. listed below is each significant holder and the number of shares owned by such significant holder in which the purchaser entities may be deemed to have beneficial ownership because of the proxy: name shares ---- ------ stephen savitsky 1,768,369

merger, parent currently intends to operate the company as a wholly owned subsidiary of parent. parent has begun, and intends to continue, a review of the company and its assets, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, geographic locations, management and personnel to determine what changes would be desirable in order best to organize and integrate the activities of the company with parent and its affiliates. parent expressly reserves the right to make any changes that it deems necessary, appropriate or desirable in light of its review or in light of future developments. following the purchase of shares in the offer, parent and purchaser expect to consummate the merger. if the merger takes place, the company no longer will be publicly owned. even if for some reason the merger does not take place, if purchaser purchases all of the tendered shares, there may be so few remaining stockholders and publicly held shares that (i) the shares may no longer be eligible to be quoted and traded on the otc bulletin board or any other securities market or exchange, (ii) there may not be any public trading market for the shares, and (iii) the company may cease making filings with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") or otherwise cease being required to comply with the sec rules relating to publicly held companies. in any event, parent and purchaser intend to cause the company to apply for termination of registration of the shares under the securities and exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon after the completion of the offer as allowed. if registration of the shares is not terminated prior to the merger, then the shares will cease to be quoted on otc bulletin board and the registration under the exchange act will be terminated following completion of the merger. item 5. interest in securities of the issuer. (a) and (b) pursuant to the proxy contained in the stockholders agreement described in item 4, purchaser and parent possess shared power to direct certain votes of 1,624,750 shares held by the significant holders (provided the offer is consummated), and purchaser and parent thus may be deemed to beneficially own such shares, which constitute approximately 31% of the issued and outstanding shares as of october 18, 2001. the purchaser entities do not currently hold any outstanding shares and in no way should be deemed to be affiliates of, or affiliated with, the company prior to consummation of the offer upon the minimum condition. none of the purchaser entities, nor to the knowledge of the purchaser entities, any executive officer or director of any of the purchaser entities, is the "beneficial owner" of any shares, as such term is defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act. (c) none of the purchaser entities nor, to the knowledge of the purchaser entities, any executive officer or director of any of the purchaser entities, has engaged in any transaction in any shares during the sixty day period immediately preceding the date hereof. (d) and (e) not applicable. item 6. contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect to securities of the issuer. except as described in this schedule 13d, none of the purchaser entities nor, to the knowledge of the purchaser entities, any executive officer or director of any of the purchaser entities, has any other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with any persons 7 with respect to the securities of the company. the description of the transactions discussed in item 4 is further described in the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement attached as exhibits hereto. such documents are incorporated herein by reference. item 7. material to be filed as exhibits.

f. concurrently with the execution of this agreement and as an inducement to parent and merger sub to enter into this agreement, the company has entered into a stock option agreement (as defined herein) in the form attached hereto as exhibit a, and certain shareholders, directors and officers of company have agreed to enter into a shareholder agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit b (the "shareholder agreement") to, among other things, tender their shares in the offer. agreement: now, therefore, in consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: article i the offer 1.1 the offer.
